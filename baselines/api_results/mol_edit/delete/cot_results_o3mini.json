In the example below the benzene ring is defined as the six aromatic carbon \u201cring\u201d (here the atoms shown as c1\u2026cc1) that is common in many organic molecules.

In a typical deletion protocol the \u201cdangling bonds\u201d (where an atom used to be bonded to the benzene carbon) are capped with hydrogen. That is, each fragment \u201closes\u201d the benzene connection and gets an extra H.\n\nLet\u2019s follow this step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. The acetamide part originally is written as \n\u2003\u2003CC(=O)N\u2013[ring]\nwith the \u2013N atom using one of its substituents to attach to the aromatic ring. Removing the benzene ring leaves the nitrogen \u201cdangling.\u201d In a deletion protocol this is capped by an H. (Note that an \u201cidealized\u201d acetamide normally is CH3C(=O)NH2.) Thus the acetamide fragment becomes\n\n\u2003\u2003CC(=O)NH2\n\n2. The benzylic substituent attached to the benzene is written as \n\u2003\u2003C[NH+]2CCC(C3CCOCC3)CC2.\nThat \u201cC\u201d is \u2013by definition\u2013 the \u201cbenzylic\u201d carbon that attached to the benzene ring. With the ring removed that bond is lost. In order to satisfy carbon\u2019s tetravalency the formerly \u201cbenzylic\u201d carbon now gets an extra hydrogen. (Remember that in SMILES, a plain \u201cC\u201d means that hydrogens are added as needed, so a carbon with only one heavy\u2010atom neighbor is by default a CH3 group.) Therefore the fragment remains\n\n\u2003\u2003C[NH+]2CCC(C3CCOCC3)CC2\n\nbut with the understanding that the \u201cC\u201d is now a CH3 group (as it is only attached to the amine in this fragment).\n\nThus, after \u201cdeleting\u201d the benzene_ring substructure the original molecule is broken into two disconnected (capped) pieces:\n\n\u2003\u2022 Fragment 1 (the \u201chead\u201d):\u2003CC(=O)NH2\n\u2003\u2022 Fragment 2 (the \u201ctail\u201d):\u2003C[NH+]2CCC(C3CCOCC3)CC2\n\nNote on charges:\n\u2003The original SMILES indicates that the amine in the second fragment is protonated (written as [NH+]). We keep that charge in the resulting fragment.\n\nSummary Answer:\nDeleting the benzene ring from\n\n\u2003\u2003CC(=O)Nc1ccc(C[NH+]2CCC(C3CCOCC3)CC2)cc1\n\nyields two fragments:\n\u2003\u2003(1)\u2003CC(=O)NH2\n\u2003\u2003(2)\u2003C[NH+]2CCC(C3CCOCC3)CC2\n\n(Here the \u201cC\u201d in fragment (2) is now understood as a CH3 group formed after capping the former benzylic bond.)"

In order to do that, we first need to identify what constitutes a thiol group and then check whether the molecule contains one.\n\nA thiol (\u2013SH) group is characterized by a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen (\u2013SH) that is attached to a carbon.

In SMILES, the notation \u201cSc\u201d represents the element scandium (Sc) because element symbols start with an uppercase letter followed by a lowercase letter if needed. Therefore, \u201cSc1sccc1\u201d is interpreted as a scandium atom (Sc) attached to an aromatic ring \u201csccc1\u201d that, due to the \u201cs\u201d in the ring, suggests that the sulfur is part of an aromatic heterocycle (a thiophene\u2010like ring).\n\n\u2022 In this case the sulfur is integrated into the ring structure and is not in the free \u2013SH (thiol) form. An aromatic sulfur in a heterocycle (like thiophene) does not have a bonded hydrogen and is not considered a thiol functional group.\n\nSince the free thiol (\u2013SH) functional group does not appear anywhere in the molecule, there is no thiol group to delete.\n\nThus, after \u201cdeleting\u201d the thiol group (which is absent), the molecule remains unchanged:\n\n\u2003\u2003Sc1sccc1/C=N/c1ccc2ccccc2c1\n\nIn summary, because the sulfur atom present is part of an aromatic ring (and not a thiol), no modification occurs when attempting to delete a thiol group."
