The central part might be the amide group (O=C-N) connecting them. Wait, but Murcko scaffolds focus on ring systems and the bonds that link them. So, the side chains like the fluorine on the second benzene (F) and the ethylenediamine group (N1CCN...CC1) should be removed.\n\nThe rings are the two benzene rings. The connecting bond is the one between the first benzene (attached to the carbonyl) and the second benzene via a single bond (the -c2ccccc2 part). The amide group (O=C-N) and the fluorine are functional groups, so those get stripped away. The ethylenediamine ring (N1CCN...CC1) is a non-ring system part, so that's a side chain. Removing all those, the scaffold should be the two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1. Let me check if that's correct. The original has the first benzene with a carbonyl and a substituent leading to the second benzene.

The sulfur atom here is part of a thioether group (SCc3ccccc3), which is a side chain. So, the rings are the benzene (c1ccc...) and the oxadiazole (c2nnco2). The connecting bond is between the benzene and the oxadiazole. The side chains to remove are the methyl (C), hydroxyl (O), and the S-linked benzene (SCc3ccccc3). Stripping those leaves the two rings connected by a single bond. So the Murcko scaffold should be c1ccc(-c2nnco2)cc1. Wait, but the original has the hydroxyl and methyl. Let me check again. The benzene ring in the input has a methyl (Cc1...), a hydroxyl (c(O)), and the oxadiazole substituent. Removing the methyl (C) and hydroxyl (O) groups, as they are side chains, leaves the benzene with the oxadiazole attached. The oxadiazole's side chain is the S-C-benzene, which needs to be removed. So the oxadiazole becomes nnco2, connected to the benzene. The final scaffold is the benzene ring connected to the oxadiazole via a single bond.

First, I need to identify the rings and the connecting bonds. The main structure has a central ring, maybe a bicyclic system. The molecule has several substituents: methyl groups (C), oxygen atoms (O), and some benzene rings attached.\n\nThe Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and exocyclic groups. So, the methyl groups (the C attached to the main ring) should be removed. The oxygen atoms (O) attached to the benzene rings are functional groups, so those benzene rings might be part of the scaffold if they're part of the ring system. Wait, the substituents like -O- are functional groups, so the benzene rings connected via oxygen might be side chains. Let me check the connectivity.\n\nLooking at the SMILES, the main ring seems to be a fused system. The parts like -c2ccc(O)cc2 are substituents attached to the main ring via a single bond. Those benzene rings with O groups are probably side chains. So, removing them would leave the central fused ring. The main ring is likely a bicyclic structure made by the central atoms. The connecting bonds between the rings should stay. So, the scaffold would be the fused rings without the attached benzene rings and methyl groups. The oxygen atoms in the main ring's structure? Wait, if the O is part of a ring, it's kept, but here the O is in substituents. So, stripping all substituents, the main scaffold is the fused ring system without the methyl, the attached benzene rings, and the oxygen groups. The final SMILES would be the central rings connected by the necessary bonds. Let me write that as c1c2ccc3cc1c(c23)n1ccccc1. Wait, maybe not. Let me parse the original SMILES again. The original has a central ring with a nitrogen? The structure is c1c(-c2...)n(...)c2...cc12. So the central ring is a bicyclic system with a nitrogen. Removing the substituents (the -c2ccc(O)cc2 parts and the methyl groups) would leave the central bicyclic ring with the nitrogen. So the scaffold would be c1ccc2c(c1)ncc2. Hmm, perhaps I need to visualize it. Alternatively, the main structure is a five-membered ring fused to another ring. Wait, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1cc2c(cc1)ncc2. Maybe not. Alternatively, breaking down the SMILES: the core is a bicyclic system where the central rings are connected. The substituents are the -c2ccc... parts. Removing those substituents (the benzene rings attached via single bonds) and the methyl groups (the C in Cc1...) would leave the central fused rings. So the scaffold should be the fused rings without the substituents. So the SMILES would be c1c(nc2ccc(cc12). Wait, maybe c1cc2c(c1)ncc2. Alternatively, perhaps the correct Murcko scaffold is c1ccc2c(c1)nccc2. Not sure. Let me try to draw it. The original molecule has a central ring with a nitrogen atom. The SMILES starts with Cc1c(...), so the first carbon is a methyl group attached to the ring. Then there's a nitrogen with another substituent. Removing all substituents (methyl, the benzene rings attached via single bonds), the core would be the rings connected through the nitrogen. So the main rings are the ones that are part of the fused system. The connecting bonds are the bonds between the rings. So the scaffold would be the fused bicyclic system. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc2c(c1)nccc2. Alternatively, perhaps the scaffold is c1cnc2ccc1cc2. Wait, I need to ensure that all side chains are removed. The original SMILES has multiple substituents: methyl groups and benzene rings attached via single bonds. Stripping those, the remaining rings are the fused ones in the core. Let me confirm. The central part is c1c(...)n(...)c2ccc(...)cc12. The substituents are the -c2ccc(O)cc2 groups and the methyl. Removing those, the main ring is the c1c...n...c2...cc12 part. So the scaffold is c1ccc2c(c1)nccc2. Wait, the original SMILES after removing substituents would be c1c(nc2ccc(cc12)). So the rings are fused, with the nitrogen in one ring. The final SMILES would be c1ccc2c(c1)nccc2. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's c1cc2c(nc1)ccc2. Let me check an example. For example, if the original molecule is a benzimidazole derivative, the Murcko scaffold would be benzimidazole. Here, the structure might be a fused ring with a nitrogen. So, after removing all substituents, the scaffold is the fused bicyclic ring. Therefore, the correct SMILES should represent that fused system. Perhaps the correct answer is c1ccc2c(c1)nccc2. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is c1cnc2ccc1cc2. Let me count the atoms. The original core is a ring with atoms c1c...n...c2...cc12. So it's a fused system where the nitrogen is part of both rings. The correct SMILES would be c1c2ccccc2nc1. Wait, perhaps that's the case. Alternatively, using the SMILES notation for fused rings, the scaffold would be c1cc2cccn2c1. Not sure. Maybe using RDKit would help, but since I can't use tools, I have to parse manually. Let me re-examine the input SMILES: Cc1c(-c2ccc(O)cc2)n(Cc2ccc(O)cc2)c2ccc(O)cc12. Breaking it down, the main ring is the first c1, then attached to it are methyl (C), another substituent (-c2ccc(O)cc2), a nitrogen with another substituent (Cc2...), and then another ring part c2ccc... connected back to c1. So the main scaffold would be the ring formed by c1, the nitrogen, and the connected c2 ring. Removing substituents, the scaffold is c1c(nc2ccc(cc12)). Wait, the c2ccc... part is part of the main ring? Because it's connected as c2ccc(O)cc12. So the main ring is a bicyclic system where c1 is connected to c2 via two bonds. So the scaffold is the fused rings without substituents. Therefore, the SMILES would be c1ccc2c(c1)nccc2. But I might be missing something. Alternatively, maybe it's c1cc2c(c1)nccc2.

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is CCC(C)(C)Nc1c(C#N)cnc2cnc(NCc3cccnc3)cc12. First, I need to identify the ring systems. Looking at the structure, there's a central ring. Let me parse the SMILES. The part \"c1c...cc12\" suggests a fused ring system. The central rings are probably the two fused rings connected by the 'cc12' part. Then there are substituents attached: the CCC(C)(C)N group, the C#N (cyano) group, and the NCc3cccnc3 part.\n\nAccording to the Murcko definition, I have to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. So, the CCC(C)(C)N is an amine side chain, the C#N is a functional group attached to the ring, and the NCc3cccnc3 is another side chain with a pyridine ring (cccnc3). The connecting bonds between the rings should stay. Removing those substituents leaves the fused ring system. The central rings are the bicyclic part where the two rings are fused. Let me check the connectivity. The main scaffold would be the two fused rings connected without any side groups. So the resulting SMILES should be c1c2cncc2cnc1, but I need to verify the numbering. Alternatively, it might be c1cc2cnc(N)cc2cn1. Wait, maybe I need to ensure that all rings are included and only the connecting bonds remain. Let me re-express the original structure: The core is a fused bicyclic system with the rings connected. After removing the substituents, the scaffold should consist of those fused rings. The correct SMILES would be c1c2cncc2cnc1. Wait, let me count the atoms. The original has a central benzene ring fused with another ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a 6-5 bicyclic system. Let me draw it mentally. The SMILES starts with N attached to the first ring (c1), then there's a C#N attached to that ring. The fused part is c1c...cc12, which implies that the second ring is connected via two adjacent atoms. So the core is a bicyclic system with two fused rings. Removing all substituents (the CCC(C)(C)N, C#N, and the NCc3cccnc3), the scaffold would be the fused rings connected by the bridge. So the Murcko scaffold SMILES would be c1c2cnc(N)cc2cnc1? Wait, no, because the nitrogen in the side chain (NCC...) is part of the substituent. Wait, the original molecule's SMILES is CCC(C)(C)Nc1c(C#N)cnc2cnc(NCc3cccnc3)cc12. Breaking it down: the central part is the c1c(C#N)cnc2cnc(...)cc12. The rings are connected via the 'cc12' part. The core rings are the benzene (c1ccc...) and another ring? Or maybe it's a quinazoline-like structure. Alternatively, perhaps the rings are two fused six-membered rings. Hmm. Wait, looking at the SMILES again: the first ring is c1, which is connected to N. Then the structure is c1c(C#N)cnc2... The 'cnc2' part suggests a nitrogen in the ring. So the first ring might be a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. Then fused to a second ring (c2), which is part of the 'cnc(NC...)cc12' part. So the fused rings are a pyrimidine fused to another ring. The substituents are the C#N, the CCC(C)(C)N, and the NCc3cccnc3 (which is a piperazine or pyridine group). Removing those substituents would leave the two fused rings. The connecting bonds are the ones between the rings. So the scaffold would be the bicyclic system without the side chains. The exact SMILES would need to represent the fused rings. Let me try to reconstruct it. The original has c1 connected to N (from the Nc1...), then c1 has a C#N attached (which we remove), then the ring continues with cnc2... So the core after removing substituents would be Nc1ccnc2cnc1cc2? Wait, perhaps I need to remove all substituents except the rings and the connecting bonds. The Murcko scaffold should retain all rings and the connecting bonds between them. So the original molecule's rings are the two fused rings: the first is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens (from the 'c1c...cnc2...'), and the second ring is a five-membered? Or maybe both are six-membered. Let me count the atoms in each ring. For the first ring (c1): positions are c1, c(C#N), c, n, c, and then connected to c2. Wait, the SMILES is Nc1c(C#N)cnc2... So starting at the N attached to c1, then c1 is connected to c(C#N), then to c, then to n, then to c, then to c2 (from cnc2). So that's a six-membered ring: positions N-c1-c(C#N)-c-n-c- ... but wait, the ring closure is at c1 and c2? Or maybe the first ring is five-membered. Alternatively, perhaps the two rings are fused, making a bicyclic system. Let me try to write the scaffold SMILES. After removing all substituents, the core would be the atoms in the rings and the bonds connecting them. So the SMILES would be Nc1ccnc2cnc1cc2. Wait, but the original has CCC(C)(C)N attached to c1. So in the scaffold, that N is part of the ring? Or is it a substituent? Wait, in the original SMILES, the N is part of the substituent (CCC(C)(C)N-), so that N is not part of the ring. Wait, no: the SMILES is CCC(C)(C)Nc1... So the N is connected to the c1. That N is part of the side chain, so in the scaffold, we should remove it. Therefore, the c1 is connected directly, without the N. Wait, but that would break the ring. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me parse the SMILES again. The input is CCC(C)(C)Nc1c(C#N)cnc2cnc(NCc3cccnc3)cc12. Breaking it down:\n\n- The main chain starts with CCC(C)(C)N- (a tert-butylamine group) attached to a carbon in a ring (c1).\n- The c1 is part of a ring: c1 is connected to the tert-butylamine N, then to a carbon with C#N (cyano), then to a carbon, then to a nitrogen (n), then to a carbon (c), then to a nitrogen (n) connected to c2 (part of another ring).\n- The c2 is part of a ring that connects back to c1 (since it's cc12, meaning c1 and c2 are bridgeheads).\n\nSo the core structure is a bicyclic system where two rings are fused via the c1 and c2 bridgeheads. The first ring (starting from c1) has the sequence c1-c(C#N)-c-n-c-n, but that's only five atoms. Wait, maybe the first ring is six-membered: c1 connected to c (with C#N), then c, then n, then c, then n, then back to c1 via c2? Not sure. Alternatively, the two rings are a five-membered and a six-membered ring fused together.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps using a tool would help, but since I'm doing this manually, I need to focus on removing all substituents. The substituents are:\n\n1. CCC(C)(C)N- attached to c1.\n2. C#N attached to the c next to c1.\n3. NCc3cccnc3 attached to the n in the c2 ring.\n\nRemoving these, the scaffold should be the bicyclic system without those groups. So the SMILES would be c1c2cnc(N)cc2cnc1. Wait, but the N here might be part of the ring. Wait, in the original structure, the N attached to c1 is part of the substituent (tert-butylamine), so in the scaffold, that N is removed, leaving c1 connected directly to the next carbon. But that would break the ring. Therefore, that N is actually part of the ring? Wait, no. In the SMILES notation, the N is outside the ring. Let me clarify: the SMILES is CCC(C)(C)Nc1... So the N is connected to c1 but not part of the ring. Therefore, when we remove that substituent, c1 is just a carbon in the ring without the N. But wait, in SMILES notation, if the N is outside the ring, then c1 is a carbon in the ring connected to that N. So removing the substituent would leave c1 as a carbon in the ring, but without the N. However, that would change the valence. Wait, c1 is a carbon in the ring. If it was originally connected to N (from the substituent), removing the N would leave a carbon with a valence of 3, which isn't possible. Therefore, that N must be part of the ring. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Let me re-express the SMILES:\n\nThe input is CCC(C)(C)Nc1c(C#N)cnc2cnc(NCc3cccnc3)cc12.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- The main chain is CCC(C)(C)N- (tert-butylamine) connected to a carbon atom (c1) which is part of a ring.\n- The ring starts with c1 connected to another carbon (which has a C#N group), then to a carbon, then to a nitrogen (n), then to a carbon (c), then to a nitrogen (n), which is connected to c2 (part of another ring).\n- The c2 is part of a ring that connects back to c1 and the previous ring.\n\nSo, the core structure includes the two fused rings, and the N from the tert-butylamine is a substituent. Therefore, removing that substituent would leave the ring intact. However, the valence of c1 would need to be satisfied. If the original c1 is part of the ring and connected to the N (substituent), removing the N would leave a carbon with three bonds. Therefore, perhaps the N is actually part of the ring. Wait, maybe the ring includes the N. Let me check the SMILES again. The part after the substituent is Nc1..., which means the N is connected to c1. If the ring is written as c1..., then c1 is a carbon in the ring. So the N is outside the ring. But that would mean that removing the N would leave a carbon with three bonds. Therefore, there must be a hydrogen attached to that carbon. But in SMILES, implicit hydrogens are allowed. So the scaffold would have a carbon (c1) with three ring bonds and one hydrogen. However, in aromatic rings, carbons are typically assumed to have alternating double bonds. But if the ring is aromatic and the carbon has three bonds (two in the ring and one to a hydrogen), that might not be possible. This suggests that the N is actually part of the ring. Wait, perhaps the ring is not purely carbon. For example, if the ring includes the N, then the N would be part of the ring. But in the SMILES, the N is outside the ring closure. Let me see: the ring closure is at the end with cc12. So the c1 is connected to c2. If the N is part of the ring, then the ring would include the N. But in the SMILES notation, the ring is defined by the numbers. The N is outside the ring closure. Therefore, the N is a substituent. This is confusing. Maybe I need to draw it. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the fused rings without any substituents, meaning the N from the substituent is removed, and the C#N is removed. The core would then be the fused bicyclic system. So the SMILES would be c1c2cnc(cc2)cnc1. But I'm not sure. Another approach: look for the rings and the connecting bonds. The rings are the two fused parts, and any bonds that connect them are kept. All side chains are removed. So in the input, after removing CCC(C)(C)N-, C#N, and NCc3cccnc3, the remaining structure is the fused rings. The connecting bonds are the ones between the two rings. So the scaffold would be c1c2cncc2cnc1. Wait, let me write that as c1cc2cnc(N)cc2cnc1. No, because the N in the original is part of the substituent. So perhaps the scaffold is c1c2cncc2cnc1. Let me check the SMILES syntax. That would be a fused bicyclic system where c1 is part of both rings. Each ring has five members? c1 connected to c2, then through the ring. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is c1ccc2cnc(N)cc2cn1. Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the correct answer is to identify the fused rings and remove all substituents. The input has two rings: one with the C#N substituent and the other with the NCc3 substituent. The core is the fused bicyclic system without those groups. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1c2cnc(N)cc2cnc1. But I need to make sure the SMILES is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the scaffold is n1c2ccccc2nc2ccccc12 (but that's for a different structure). Wait, maybe the correct SMILES is c1cnc2cncc2c1. Let me count the atoms. For the first ring (c1): c1 connected to c (from C#N), then c, then n, then c, then n connected to c2. Then c2 is part of another ring connected back to c1. So the scaffold would be a fused bicyclic system with two six-membered rings? Or maybe five and six. Alternatively, the scaffold is c1cc2cnc(cc2)cnc1. I'm not entirely confident, but based on the process of removing substituents and keeping rings and connecting bonds, the output scaffold should be c1c2cncc2cnc1.",

The main structure seems to be a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1) attached to a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)). The sulfonyl is connected to two ethyl groups (CC), but those are side chains, so they should be removed.\n\nThen, looking at the substituent on the benzene ring: there's a carbonyl group (C(=O)) attached to an amine (NCCC...). The amine is connected to a propyl chain (CCC) leading to a piperazine-like ring (n2ccnc2). The piperazine is a ring, so that's part of the scaffold. The propyl chain connecting the benzene to the piperazine is a single bond chain, which acts as a connecting bridge. So, the core rings are the benzene and the piperazine (which is a 6-membered ring with two nitrogens), connected via the carbonyl and the propyl chain. The side chains like the ethyl groups on the sulfonyl and the propyl's terminal parts should be stripped. The final scaffold should be the benzene ring connected via the sulfonyl (since it's directly attached) to the carbonyl and then through the propyl bridge to the piperazine ring. Wait, the connecting bonds are the ones between the rings. So the sulfonyl is part of the bridge between benzene and the amide. But wait, Murcko scaffold typically retains only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) is a functional group, so maybe that gets removed? Or is it part of the connecting structure? Hmm. Wait, the definition says to remove functional groups, so sulfonyl might be considered a functional group. So the benzene ring is connected via a single bond to the sulfur, but since the sulfonyl is a functional group, it's removed. Wait, but the connecting bonds between rings are kept. So perhaps the benzene is connected to the sulfur, but the sulfonyl groups (the =O parts) are functional groups. But the sulfur itself is part of the connecting structure? Or is the sulfur part of a ring? No, the sulfur is attached to the benzene and the two ethyl groups. Since ethyl groups are side chains, they are removed. The sulfonyl group (S with two double bonds to O) would be considered a functional group, so the sulfur might be removed as well. Wait, but the sulfur is part of the bridge? Wait, the benzene is connected via S to the ethyl groups. But those are side chains. So after removing side chains, the benzene would only have the sulfonyl group, which is a functional group, so that's removed. Wait, but then the benzene would have no connecting bonds. Wait, maybe the original structure is benzene connected via S(=O)(=O) to N(CC)CC. But the N is connected to two ethyl groups (side chains), so those are removed. Then the sulfur is connected to the benzene and the N. If the N's side chains are removed, then the connecting path would be benzene-S-N-... but the N is part of the connecting bridge. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again. The Murcko scaffold is rings plus the connecting bonds. So any atom that is part of a bridge between two rings is kept. Functional groups attached to rings or bridges are removed. So in the input molecule, the benzene ring is connected via the sulfonyl group to an amine, which is connected to a propyl chain leading to a piperazine ring. The sulfonyl (S(=O)(=O)) is a functional group attached to the benzene, so it's removed. The amine (N) connected to ethyl groups (side chains) would have those ethyls removed. The propyl chain between the amine and the piperazine is a connecting bridge, so it's kept. So the scaffold would be benzene connected via a single bond (originally from S, but S is part of a functional group, so removed) to the amine, which is connected via the propyl chain to the piperazine. Wait, but if the S is part of a functional group, then the benzene's substituent is removed, so the benzene would have no substituent? That can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the sulfonyl group is part of the connecting bridge. Let me visualize the molecule. Benzene ring with a sulfonyl group (S=O) attached. The sulfonyl is connected to an N that has two ethyl groups (side chains). Then the N is connected via a carbonyl (C=O) to a propyl chain (CCC) leading to a piperazine ring (n2ccnc2). Wait, the propyl chain is between the carbonyl and the piperazine. So the rings are the benzene and the piperazine. The connecting bonds would be the path between them: benzene-S(=O)(=O)-N-C(=O)-CCC-N- (piperazine). But the S and the carbonyl are functional groups. So according to Murcko's definition, those functional groups are removed, leaving only the rings and the connecting bonds. So the connecting bonds would be the chain between the benzene and the piperazine. But how? If we remove the S(=O)(=O) and the C(=O), then the connecting chain would be the N-CCC-N. But N is part of the functional groups? Wait, maybe the connecting bonds are the atoms that form the shortest path between the two rings. So the benzene is connected via S to N, then via C(=O) to CCC, then to N in the piperazine. But the S and the carbonyl are functional groups. So perhaps those are removed, leaving the benzene connected via a chain (N-CCC-N) to the piperazine. But the N's might be part of the connecting chain. Wait, maybe the actual scaffold is the benzene ring connected via a single bond (from S) but S is removed, so perhaps it's not part of the scaffold. This is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to iteratively remove all side chains and functional groups. The rings are benzene and piperazine. The connecting chain is the shortest path between them. The path is benzene-S(=O)(=O)-N-C(=O)-CCC-N-piperazine. So the functional groups S(=O)(=O) and C(=O) would be removed, leaving the chain as N-CCC-N. But N is part of the connecting chain. However, according to the Murcko rules, the connecting bonds are the atoms that link the rings. So the scaffold would be benzene connected via a chain (N-C-C-C-N) to the piperazine. But that chain might be considered a connecting bridge. However, the N's in that chain are part of the original structure's functional groups (the amine and the amide). Wait, perhaps the correct scaffold is the benzene ring connected via the propyl chain (CCC) to the piperazine, but without the functional groups. Wait, the original substituent on the benzene is S(=O)(=O)-N(CC)... So when removing side chains (the ethyl groups on N), the N would have two hydrogens. Then the N is connected to the C(=O), which is a functional group, so that's removed. Then the propyl chain (CCC) connects to the piperazine. So the connecting bridge would be N-CCC, but the N is part of the functional group. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's use a tool-based approach. Alternatively, I can look up that the Murcko scaffold is generated by removing all atoms that are not in rings or in the linker between rings. The linker is defined as the shortest path between two rings. So first, identify all rings. The benzene is one ring. The piperazine (n2ccnc2) is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. Then, the linker between them is the path connecting these two rings. The path from benzene to piperazine: benzene -> S -> N -> C(=O) -> CCC -> N -> piperazine. But S and the carbonyl are not part of rings. So the linker is the chain between the benzene's S (if S is part of the linker) but S is in a functional group. Wait, maybe the linker is the minimal path between the two rings. Let me count the atoms. Benzene (ring) -> S (not a ring) -> N (not a ring) -> C=O (not a ring) -> CCC -> N (part of piperazine ring). So the linker would be S-N-C-O-C-C-C-N. But since S, N, O are not part of rings, but are in the linker. But according to Murcko, the scaffold is rings and the connecting bonds (linker). So the linker is the atoms that connect two rings. So even if they are not part of rings, they are kept. So the entire path from benzene to piperazine is kept. But functional groups attached to the linker would be removed. For example, the ethyl groups on the N (in N(CC)) are side chains, so they are removed. The carbonyl (C=O) is a functional group attached to the linker, so it's removed. So the linker becomes S-N-C-CCC-N. But the S is part of the sulfonyl group, which is a functional group. Wait, but the S is part of the linker, so it's kept. Or is the sulfonyl considered a functional group and thus removed? This is where I'm getting stuck. According to the definition, functional groups are removed. The sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) is a functional group attached to the benzene. So it's removed. Therefore, the benzene would be connected to nothing via the S. But that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the sulfonyl is part of the linker. Because it's between the benzene and the next atom. So if the sulfonyl is part of the linker, then the linker includes the S and the two oxygens (as part of the functional group). But that contradicts the definition. Wait, the definition says to remove all side chains, functional groups, and exocyclic modifications. So the sulfonyl is a functional group attached to the benzene. So the benzene's substituents would be removed, leaving only the benzene ring. But then the benzene would not be connected to anything else. However, the other ring is the piperazine. So how are they connected? The original molecule has a substituent on the benzene leading to the piperazine. But if all functional groups are removed, maybe the entire chain between the benzene and piperazine is considered a functional group. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I should use an algorithm. The standard method for Murcko scaffold is:\n\n1. Convert the molecule to its framework by removing all terminal atoms (side chains) iteratively until only rings and the connecting atoms remain.\n\nSo, starting with the input molecule:\n\nThe benzene ring has a sulfonyl group attached. The sulfonyl is connected to a diethylamine (N(CC)CC). The diethylamine is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is connected to a propyl chain (CCC) leading to a piperazine ring.\n\nFirst, remove all terminal atoms. The ethyl groups (CC) on the N are terminal, so they are removed. The N now has two bonds (to S and to C=O). The carbonyl group's oxygen is a terminal functional group, so it's removed, leaving a single bond between C and O (but wait, carbonyl is a double bond. Hmm, this might complicate things). Alternatively, the carbonyl is part of the connecting chain. Wait, maybe the algorithm is to remove all atoms that are not in rings or part of the linker between rings. The linker is the minimal path between two rings. So the benzene and piperazine are rings. The linker between them is the shortest path: benzene-S-N-C(=O)-CCC-N-piperazine. So the linker includes S, N, C, O, C, C, C, N. But the O is part of a functional group (carbonyl), so it should be removed. Similarly, the sulfonyl's oxygens are functional groups. So removing them would leave S connected to benzene and N. But S is not part of a ring, so maybe it's part of the linker. However, if functional groups are removed, perhaps the entire sulfonyl group (S and O's) are removed. Then the benzene is left with nothing. But that would disconnect the scaffold. Alternatively, maybe the S is kept as part of the linker. This is getting too ambiguous. Let me check an example. For example, if the molecule is benzene-SO2-NH-COO-... then the Murcko scaffold would be benzene connected via the linker (S-N-C-O...) to the other ring. But I think in practice, the sulfonyl group is considered a functional group and removed. So the benzene would lose the sulfonyl group. But then how is it connected to the other ring? Maybe in this case, the actual connecting chain starts after the functional groups. So after removing the sulfonyl and the carbonyl, the connecting chain is the propyl (CCC) between the N and the piperazine. But the N was part of the sulfonyl group's amine. If the sulfonyl is removed, then the benzene has no substituent. This suggests that maybe the Murcko scaffold in this case is just the two rings (benzene and piperazine) with no connecting chain, which doesn't make sense because they were originally connected. Alternatively, perhaps the connecting chain is retained if it's part of the linker. I'm confused. Let's try another approach. Using RDKit's Murcko scaffold function. If I process the SMILES CCN(CC)S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2)cc1, the Murcko scaffold would be the rings and the connecting atoms. The benzene ring and the piperazine ring are the rings. The connecting atoms would be the path between them: S, N, C, O, CCC, N. But RDKit's implementation might consider which atoms to keep. Alternatively, the actual scaffold would be the benzene connected via a single bond to the sulfur, then to the N, then to the C, then the propyl chain (CCC), then to the N in the piperazine. But functional groups like the sulfonyl's oxygens and the carbonyl's oxygen would be removed. So the scaffold would be benzene-S-N-C-CCC-N connected to the piperazine. But sulfur is not part of a ring. However, the connecting bonds include non-ring atoms. So the final scaffold would be the benzene linked via S-N-C-CCC-N to the piperazine. But in SMILES, that would be c1ccc(SNCCCN2ccnc2)cc1. Wait, but the original sulfonyl has two double bonds to oxygen. Since oxygens are removed, the sulfur would have only single bonds. But that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfur is removed along with the oxygens, leaving the benzene connected directly to the N. But that's not possible because the original structure has benzene connected to S. If the sulfonyl group is removed, the benzene would have a single bond to nothing. So perhaps the correct approach is to retain the sulfur as part of the linker. Therefore, the scaffold is the benzene connected via S-N-C-CCC-N to the piperazine ring. But the exact SMILES would need to reflect that. However, in the original molecule, the S is part of a sulfone group, which is a functional group. According to the definition, functional groups are removed, so the S and its attachments (the two oxygens) would be removed. But then the benzene would have a bond to nothing, which isn't possible. This suggests that perhaps the sulfonyl group is considered part of the linker. Hence, the scaffold includes the benzene, the sulfur (as part of the linker), the N, the carbonyl's carbon (with oxygen removed), the propyl chain, and the N connecting to the piperazine. But this is getting too detailed. Maybe the correct answer is the benzene ring connected to the piperazine via the propyl chain, excluding the sulfonyl and carbonyl groups. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(CCCN2ccnc2)cc1. But that's not correct because the original connection is via the sulfonyl and amide groups. Alternatively, the correct scaffold is c1ccc(s2ccnc2)cc1, but that doesn't include the connecting chain. I'm stuck. Let me try to find a systematic way. The Murcko scaffold is obtained by removing all side chains and functional groups, leaving rings and connecting bonds. So:\n\n1. Identify all rings: benzene (c1ccc...cc1) and the piperazine (n2ccnc2).\n\n2. Find the connecting bonds between them. The connecting path is S(=O)(=O)c1... then N(CC)... C(=O)NCCC... n2ccnc2.\n\n3. Remove side chains: the ethyl groups (CC) on the N, the propyl chain (CCC) is part of the connecting path.\n\n4. Functional groups: S(=O)(=O) and C(=O) are functional groups. So they are removed. So the connecting path becomes N-CCC-N.\n\n5. Therefore, the scaffold is the benzene connected via N-CCC-N to the piperazine.\n\nBut benzene is connected to N via a single bond. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(NCCCN2ccnc2)cc1.\n\nWait, but the original benzene is attached to S. If S is part of a functional group (sulfonyl), then it's removed. So the benzene's substituent is N, connected via CCC to the piperazine. But how is the N attached to the benzene? In the original structure, the N is connected to S, which is attached to the benzene. If S is removed, then the benzene is connected directly to N? No, that's not possible. So perhaps the S is considered part of the linker. Then the linker is S-N-CCC-N. But S is not part of a ring, but is part of the connecting path. So the scaffold includes the benzene, the S, N, CCC, N, and the piperazine. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(S(NCCCN2ccnc2))cc1. But that's not valid SMILES syntax. Alternatively, the correct SMILES is c1ccc(s2ccnc2)cc1, which is benzene fused to the piperazine, which isn't the case. Alternatively, the connecting chain is kept as is, without the functional groups. So benzene connected via S-N-CCC-N to the piperazine. But the sulfonyl's oxygens are removed, leaving S with single bonds. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(S(N)CCCN2ccnc2)cc1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1ccc(-N-CCCN-c2ccnc2)cc1. The SMILES would be c1ccc(NCCCN2ccnc2)cc1. Let me check the connectivity. The benzene is connected to N, which is connected to CCCN which connects to the piperazine. Yes, that makes sense. So the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via an amine group (N) connected to a propyl chain (CCC) connected to another amine (N) which is part of the piperazine ring. So the SMILES is c1ccc(NCCCN2ccnc2)cc1. But wait, the original N connected to the benzene was part of the sulfonyl group. If the sulfonyl is removed, then the benzene is connected directly to N. But in the original structure, the N is connected to S. So without S, the benzene would have a bond to N. That's possible. So the final scaffold would be c1ccc(NCCCN2ccnc2)cc1. Let me validate this. The rings are benzene and piperazine, connected via N-CCC-N. The functional groups (sulfonyl, carbonyl) are removed. Yes, that seems to fit the definition. So the answer should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc(NCCCN2ccnc2)cc1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is COc1cc2c(cc1OC)-c1cc(Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)nc(=O)n1CC2. First, I need to identify the rings and connecting bonds. The molecule has multiple rings. Let's break it down. The main structure probably has a central ring connected to others. The substituents like methoxy groups (OCH3), chlorine atoms, and the amide group (Nc...) are side chains or functional groups. So, removing those. The rings remaining would be the core. Let me visualize the structure. The central part is a bicyclic system with two rings connected by a bridge (the CC2 part). The side chains include the OCH3 groups, the Cl atoms on the benzene ring, and the amide group. Stripping those away leaves the bicyclic system. The rings are likely the two fused rings connected by the bridge. So the scaffold should be the bicyclic system without any substituents. The connecting bonds are the single bonds between the rings. Putting that into SMILES: the core would be c1cc2c(cc1)-c1ccccc1n2, but wait, let me check the connectivity. The original structure has a bridge between the rings. Maybe the scaffold is c1cc2c(cc1)-c1cccnc1C2, but I need to ensure all side chains are removed. Wait, the original has a bridge of CC2. So after removing substituents, the bridge remains. So the scaffold should be the two rings connected by the bridge. The correct SMILES would be c1cc2c(cc1)-c1ccncc1C2. Let me verify. The original has a central bicyclo structure with rings connected by a two-carbon bridge (CC2). The substituents are all the OCH3, Cl, Nc..., and the carbonyl. Removing those leaves the rings and the bridge. So the Murcko scaffold is the fused rings plus the bridge. The SMILES would be C1CC2=C(C1)C1=CC=CN=C1N2. Wait, no, maybe I need to adjust the numbering. Let me re-express it. The core is the bicyclo[2.2.1] structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's c1ccc2c(c1)C1C(c3cccnc31)CC2. Hmm, maybe I should use a tool to verify. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll proceed. The key is to keep all rings and the connecting bonds. The substituents like OCH3, Cl, and the amide (Nc...) are removed. The final SMILES should represent the core rings and the bridge. After careful consideration, the correct scaffold SMILES is C1CC2=CC(=O)N=C1C3=C2C=CC=C3. Wait, no, that's including the carbonyl which is a functional group. Oh right, the carbonyl (O) is part of the exocyclic group and should be removed. So removing the =O from the amide. So the ring becomes nc([C])n, but wait, without substituents. Let me try again. The original rings are: one benzene ring (from COc1cc2...), another ring connected via the CC2 bridge. The amide group is part of a ring? Let's see, the part \"nc(=O)n1CC2\" \u2013 the NC(=O)N is part of a ring. Wait, the nitrogen is part of the ring. So that ring has the atoms N-C(=O)-N connected via the bridge. So when we remove the =O (functional group), that ring becomes N-C-N. But wait, in the Murcko scaffold, we remove exocyclic modifications. The =O is an exocyclic double bond, so it's removed. So the ring becomes a 5-membered ring with two nitrogens. So the SMILES would be c1cc2c(cc1)-c1ccncn1CC2. Wait, but the original has \"nc(=O)n1CC2\". Removing the =O gives \"ncn1CC2\", so the ring becomes a three-membered ring? No, that can't be right. Maybe the carbonyl is part of the ring? Let me parse the original SMILES again. The SMILES is COc1cc2c(cc1OC)-c1cc(Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)nc(=O)n1CC2. Breaking it down: The main structure is a bicyclic system. The first part is COc1cc2c(cc1OC), which is a benzene ring with two methoxy groups. Then connected to -c1cc(...) which is another ring. The part after that is Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl, which is a benzene ring with two Cl substituents. Then \"nc(=O)n1CC2\" \u2013 this forms a ring. The 'n1' indicates that the nitrogen is part of a ring. So the 'nc(=O)n1' forms a three-membered ring? Wait, SMILES notation: the indices refer to the ring closure. So 'n(=O)n1' would connect back to position 1. Let's imagine the structure. The sequence is N-C(=O)-N connected to CC2. So the ring is a five-membered ring: positions 1 (N), 2 (C=O), 3 (N), 4 (C), 5 (C), connected back to position 1. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring. This part is tricky. Maybe the original molecule has a central bicyclo structure with rings connected via bridges. The key is to remove all substituents except the rings and connecting bonds. So the methoxy (OCH3), chlorine atoms, and the amide group (including the carbonyl) are removed. The remaining scaffold would be the rings and the bridges. Let's try to write the SMILES without substituents. The original SMILES after removing substituents would be c1cc2c(cc1)-c1ccncn1CC2. But wait, the \"CC2\" is part of the bridge. So the scaffold would have two benzene rings connected by a bridge. Alternatively, maybe it's a fused ring system. Another approach: the Murcko scaffold is generated by removing all atoms that are not part of a ring or a linker between rings. So, any atom that's in a side chain is removed. The rings are the benzene rings and the ring containing the amide group. But the amide group's carbonyl is exocyclic, so it's removed. So the ring would become a dihydro ring. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct scaffold is the combination of the two benzene rings connected via a bridge and the ring formed by the N-C-N bridge. But without the substituents. The final SMILES might be C1CC2=C(C1)C3=C(C=CN3)C2. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, using a tool like RDKit would help, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll proceed. The correct answer is likely the core bicyclic system with the rings and bridges, without any substituents. So the SMILES would be C1CC2=C(C1)C3=CC=CN=C3C2. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check again. The original molecule has a bridge CC2 connecting two rings. The first ring is a benzene (c1cc2...), the second ring is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens (from nc(=O)n1). After removing the substituents and the carbonyl, the five-membered ring becomes a dihydro ring with two nitrogens. So the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via a bridge to a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. The SMILES would be c1ccc2c(c1)CC1Nc3ccccc3N12. No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, considering that the bridge is part of both rings, the SMILES might be C1CC2=C(C1)C1=CC=CN=C1C2. Yes, that seems to represent a bicyclic system with two rings connected by a bridge. The rings are a benzene and a pyrazine-like ring (two nitrogens). So the final SMILES is C1CC2=C(C1)C1=CC=CN=C1C2.",

The input is CC12CCN(C(=O)C3CCC(C(=O)O)CC3)C(Cc3c(O)cccc31)C2(C)C.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the ring systems. The molecule has a bicyclic structure.

Also, there's a benzene ring indicated by cccc3.\n\nTo extract the Murcko scaffold, I need to remove all side chains and functional groups. So, the carbonyl groups (C=O), the carboxyl (C(=O)O), and the oxygen in the benzene ring (O) should be stripped. The cyclohexane part (C3CCC...) would lose its substituents, leaving just the ring. The benzene ring with the oxygen might lose the hydroxyl group, so it becomes a plain benzene ring.\n\nThe connecting bonds between the rings should stay. The main structure would be the bicyclic core (the CC12CC... part) connected to the benzene ring. The ethyl groups (C(Cc3c...) and other substituents like (C2(C)C) should be removed.\n\nPutting it all together, the Murcko scaffold would consist of the two fused rings (the bridged system) connected to the benzene ring, with all the side chains and functional groups removed.

Looking at the SMILES, there are two main rings connected by a triple bond (C#C). The first part has a ring with 'ncnc' which is a five-membered ring, maybe a pyrimidine? Then there's a benzene ring attached via a carbonyl group. Wait, but the definition says to remove side chains and exocyclic groups. So the benzene ring with Cl and the amide group (C(=O)N...) would be side chains. The other part after the triple bond is another ring, likely a pyridine or similar with an amino group (N). But the amino group is a substituent, so that should be removed.\n\nSo, breaking it down: the core scaffold should be the two rings connected by the triple bond. The first ring is the five-membered ring (ncnc), and the second is a six-membered ring (ccc...nc). Wait, the second part after the triple bond is 'c1ccc(N)nc1'. That's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens? Like a pyrimidine or pyridine. But the N here is a substituent, so remove that. So the scaffold would be the five-membered ring connected via triple bond to the six-membered ring, stripped of all substituents like Cl, amide groups, amino groups, etc.\n\nWait, the original molecule has a -C(=O)N3CCN(CCN)CC3 attached to the benzene ring. That's a cyclic amine? So the benzene ring is part of the scaffold? No, because according to the definition, the Murcko scaffold includes ring systems and connecting bonds. So any ring that's part of the main structure stays, but substituents on those rings are removed. So the benzene ring (c2ccc(...)c(Cl)c2) is a side chain attached to the five-membered ring via the carbonyl group. Therefore, the benzene ring and its substituents (Cl, the amide group) should be removed. Similarly, the amino group (N) on the six-membered ring after the triple bond is a substituent and should be removed.\n\nSo the core rings are the five-membered ring (ncnc) connected via a triple bond (C#C) to the six-membered ring (ccc nc). Wait, after removing substituents, the six-membered ring would have carbons and nitrogens in the ring. Let me parse the SMILES again. The part after the triple bond is C#Cc1ccc(N)nc1. The 'c1ccc(N)nc1' part: the 'nc1' suggests a nitrogen in the ring. So the six-membered ring is cccc nc, which would make it a pyridine ring. The amino group (N) is a substituent, so removing that leaves the pyridine ring as part of the scaffold.\n\nSo putting it all together: the five-membered ring (probably a pyrimidine-like structure) connected via a triple bond to a pyridine ring. The original substituents like the ethyl group (CC), the benzene ring with Cl, the amide group, and the amino group on the pyridine are all removed. The connecting bonds between the rings are kept, which here is the triple bond. So the resulting scaffold should be the two rings connected by the triple bond, without any side chains.\n\nThe SMILES for the scaffold would be c1ncnc(-c2cccc2)c1C#Cc1ccccn1. Wait, but I need to make sure the rings are properly closed. Let me reconstruct. The original five-membered ring is c1ncnc(...)c1. After removing the substituent (-c2ccc...), that becomes c1ncncc1. Then connected via C#C to the other ring. The other ring after removing the amino group (N) would be c1cccnc1. Wait, but the original part is c1ccc(N)nc1. Removing the N substituent gives c1cccnc1. Wait, no. The original is c1ccc(N)nc1. The 'nc1' means a nitrogen at position 5 (assuming 1-based numbering). So the ring is c1 (position 1) followed by c (position 2), c (3), c (4), N (5), and back to c1 (position 6?), but that's a six-membered ring? Wait, SMILES notation for rings: each ring closure is numbered. So the 'c1ccc(N)nc1' is a six-membered ring: positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. Positions 1 and 6 are connected. The atoms are: position 1: c, position 2: c, position3: c, position4: c(N), position5: n, position6: c. So the ring is c-c-c-c(N)-n-c. Wait, but that's a six-membered ring with a nitrogen at position 5. So after removing the substituent (N), the ring becomes c-c-c-c-n-c. Wait, but the substituent was on position4 (the 'N' in 'ccc(N)'). So removing that gives c1ccccnc1. So the SMILES for that ring would be c1ccccn1. So the entire scaffold would be the five-membered ring connected via triple bond to the six-membered ring with one nitrogen. So the SMILES would be C#C linking them: c1ncncc1C#Cc1ccccn1. Wait, but in the original SMILES, the first ring is CCc1ncnc(...)c1C#C... So the ethyl group (CC) is a substituent on the first ring, which should be removed. So the first ring becomes c1ncnc(...)c1. The substituent on the first ring is -c2ccc(...) which is attached via the carbonyl group. Removing that substituent, the first ring is just the five-membered ring without any substituents. Wait, but the original structure has the five-membered ring with substituents. Wait, the SMILES is CCc1ncnc(-c2...)c1C#C... So the substituent on the five-membered ring is the -c2... group. So removing that substituent, the five-membered ring becomes c1ncncc1. Then connected via C#C to the other ring, which after removing substituents is c1ccccn1. So combining them: c1ncncc1C#Cc1ccccn1. But wait, SMILES requires unique numbering for ring closures. The two 'c1' would conflict. So the correct SMILES would need different numbers for each ring. Let's adjust: the first ring is c1ncnc(C#Cc2ccccn2)c1. Wait, no. Alternatively, the first ring is c1ncnc(-C#C-c2ccccn2)c1. But since we removed the substituent (the benzene ring attached via carbonyl), the only substituent left on the five-membered ring is the triple bond. So the five-membered ring is c1ncnc(C#Cc2ccccn2)c1. But actually, the original substituent on the five-membered ring was -c2ccc(...), which is replaced by just the connecting bond. Wait, perhaps the correct scaffold is the two rings connected by the triple bond, with the five-membered ring and the six-membered ring. So the SMILES would be C#C connecting the two rings. Let me write it properly: c1c(nc(nc1)C#Cc2cnccc2. Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, c1ncnc(c1)C#Cc1ccccn1. But need to ensure proper ring closure numbers. Let me try building it step by step. The first ring is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. Starting with atom 1: c, then n, c, n, c, and back to atom 1. So the SMILES would be c1ncnc1. But in the original structure, the five-membered ring has a substituent at position 4 (the 'c(-c2...)'). So after removing that substituent, the ring is c1ncnc1. Then connected via C#C to the six-membered ring. The six-membered ring, after removing the amino group, is c1ccccn1. So connecting them: c1ncnc1C#Cc1ccccn1. However, SMILES requires that each ring closure has a unique number. So the first ring uses closure '1', the second ring can't also use '1'. So the correct SMILES would be c1ncnc1C#Cc2ccccn2. That should be the scaffold: two rings connected by a triple bond. The first ring is a five-membered ring (c1ncnc1), the second is a six-membered ring with one nitrogen (c2ccccn2). So the final SMILES is c1ncnc1C#Cc2ccccn2.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is COc1cc2nc(N3CCN(C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4)CC3)nc(N)c2cc1OC. First, I need to identify the ring systems. The main structure has two benzene rings connected by a bridge. The first ring is the o-methoxy groups (OC), but those are side chains. The second part has a pyrimidine-like ring with nitrogen atoms. The substituents like the methoxy groups (OC), the fluorine (F), the amide group (C(=O)), and the piperazine ring (N3CCN...CC3) are all side chains or functional groups. The exocyclic double bond (C(F)=Cc4ccccc4) needs to be simplified. Removing all those, the core should be the two benzene rings connected via the nitrogen-containing bridge. The connecting bonds between the rings are the key. Let me check the rings again. The main scaffold would be the bicyclic system with the two aromatic rings connected by the two nitrogens in the central bridge. So the Murcko scaffold would be the fused rings without the substituents. The final SMILES would be c1cc2nc(nc(N)c2cc1, but wait, need to make sure all substituents are removed. Oh, but the central ring has the connecting bonds. Maybe it's c1cc2nc(nc(c1)c3ccccc3)c2. Hmm, perhaps I should map the rings correctly. The main rings are the two benzene rings and the central pyrimidine-like ring. Wait, the input has a benzene ring (c4ccccc4) attached via a double bond, which is exocyclic, so that part is removed. The core is the fused rings connected by the central bridge. So stripping all substituents: methoxy groups, the amide, fluorine, and the piperazine ring. The resulting scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by the nitrogen-containing bridge. So the SMILES should be c1cc2nc(nc(c1)c3ccccc3)c2. Wait, no, the original structure might have the central ring as a pyrimidine. Let me draw it out. The original SMILES is COc1cc2nc(...)nc(N)c2cc1OC. The core is the benzene ring (c1cc...cc1) with the central nc(...)nc(N) part. Removing substituents, the central part becomes a pyrimidine ring (ncnc). So combining the benzene rings and the pyrimidine. But maybe the exact scaffold is the two benzene rings connected via the pyrimidine. Alternatively, maybe it's a fused system. Hmm, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1c2nc(nc(c1)c3ccccc3)c2. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me parse the SMILES again. The main structure is a benzene ring (c1cc2...) connected to a pyrimidine ring (nc(...)nc). The substituents like OCH3, the piperazine, and the C(F)=Cc4ccccc4 are all side chains. So removing those, the scaffold is the benzene ring fused to the pyrimidine ring. Wait, no, the pyrimidine is a separate ring connected via a bond. Maybe the scaffold is the two benzene rings connected by the central pyrimidine-like bridge. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1cc2nc(nc(c1)c3ccccc3)c2. Alternatively, c1cc2nc([nH]c(c2)c3ccccc13. No, perhaps it's better to systematically remove all substituents. The original SMILES has two methoxy groups (OC), which are removed. The nitrogen atoms in the nc(...)nc part are part of the ring. The piperazine (N3CCN...CC3) is a side chain and removed. The C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4 is also a side chain. So the core rings are the benzene (c1cc2...) and the pyrimidine (nc(...)nc) with the connecting bonds. The final scaffold would be the benzene ring fused to a pyrimidine ring? Or are they connected via single bonds? Wait, the SMILES is COc1cc2nc(...)nc(N)c2cc1OC. So the benzene ring (c1) is connected to the pyrimidine (c2). So the scaffold would be the benzene ring (c1) connected via a bond to the pyrimidine ring (c2). But Murcko scaffolds retain the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So the rings are the benzene and the pyrimidine, connected by the bond between them. But in the original structure, the benzene (c1) is connected to the pyrimidine (c2) via a single bond. So the scaffold would be the two rings connected by that bond, with all other substituents removed. So the benzene ring becomes c1ccc2..., the pyrimidine is nc(...)nc. After removing substituents, the scaffold would be c1cc2nc(nc(N)c2cc1). Wait, but the 'N' in nc(N) is a substituent. So that should be removed. So the pyrimidine ring would have nitrogens but no substituents. So the correct scaffold would be c1cc2nc(nc)c2cc1. But that's not valid. Let me reconstruct. The original core is benzene (c1) connected to a pyrimidine ring (c2). The pyrimidine has two nitrogens. The substituents on the pyrimidine are the N3... (piperazine) and the NH2 (from nc(N)). Removing those, the pyrimidine becomes nc(nc), so the SMILES would be c1cc2nc(nc)c2cc1. But that's not valid because the pyrimidine needs proper bonding. Wait, the pyrimidine is part of the ring system. Let me think again. The original SMILES for the central part is nc(N3CCN...)nc(N). Removing substituents, the N3CCN... is a side chain, so removed. The nc(N) becomes nc. So the pyrimidine becomes nc(nc). So the SMILES would be c1cc2nc(nc)c2cc1. But that's not a valid ring structure. Maybe the correct structure is a benzene ring fused to a pyrimidine ring. For example, c1c2nc(nc)c2cc1. But how? Alternatively, perhaps the scaffold is a bicyclic system with two benzene rings connected by a bridge. Wait, the input molecule has a benzene ring (c1) connected to another benzene (c4) via a chain, but that's part of a side chain (C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4), which is removed. So the core is the first benzene connected to the pyrimidine-like ring. Let me look up an example of Murcko scaffold extraction. For example, if the molecule has a benzene ring with an attached side chain that includes another ring, the Murcko scaffold would include both rings if they're connected by a bridge. But in this case, the other benzene (c4) is part of a side chain (connected via =C), so it's exocyclic and removed. Therefore, the main rings are the first benzene and the pyrimidine. The connecting bonds between them are kept. So the scaffold is the benzene connected to the pyrimidine via a single bond, with all substituents removed. So the SMILES would be c1cc2nc(nc)c2cc1. But that might not form a proper ring. Alternatively, maybe the pyrimidine is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. Wait, the original structure's c2 is part of a ring: the nc(N3...)nc(N) is part of a ring. So the central part is a pyrimidine ring (six-membered with two nitrogens). Wait, the SMILES is nc(N3...)nc(N), which suggests that the two nitrogens are adjacent in a ring. But perhaps it's a five-membered ring? Let me parse the SMILES again. The input is COc1cc2nc(N3CCN(C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4)CC3)nc(N)c2cc1OC. The part after COc1cc2 is nc(...)nc(...)c2cc1OC. So the 'nc(...)nc(...)c2' suggests that the second ring is a five-membered ring: positions 2,3,4,5,6 (assuming the first benzene is positions 1-6). Wait, SMILES notation can be tricky. Let's consider that the 'c2' is part of a ring closure. The structure after the first benzene (c1cc2...) is a new ring starting at position 2: nc(...)nc(...)c2. So the second ring is positions 2, connected to N, then another C, then N, then another C, then back to position 2. That forms a five-membered ring: 2 (C), N, C, N, C, back to 2. But that's only five atoms, which would make a five-membered ring. However, five-membered rings with two nitrogens are possible. But in this case, the ring would be 2 (C from benzene), N, C, N, C, and back to 2. Wait, that's five atoms: C, N, C, N, C. But the SMILES notation nc(...)nc(...)c2 implies that after the first N, there's a connection. Let me write it out:\n\nThe main benzene ring is c1 (positions 1-6). At position 2 of c1, we have a connection to a new ring: c2. The structure is nc(N3...)nc(N)c2. So the sequence is: position 2 (from c1) connected to N, then C (from nc), then N3 (part of the piperazine), then C, then N (from nc(N)), then C, and back to c2 (position 2 of the first benzene). Wait, that doesn't form a ring. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the central part is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. Let me try to draw it:\n\nThe main benzene ring (c1) has a bridge starting at position 2: the sequence is nc(...)nc(...)c2. So the bridge forms a six-membered ring: starting at c2 (from benzene), then N, C, N, C, C, and back to c2. That would make a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. So the scaffold would be the benzene ring fused to this six-membered ring with two nitrogens. So the fused rings would be a bicyclic system: benzene fused to a pyrimidine-like ring. In that case, the Murcko scaffold would be this fused bicyclic system. The SMILES for that would be c1c2nc(nc)c2cc1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fused system would be represented as c1cc2nc(nc)c2cc1. Let me check with a standard Murcko example. For instance, if you have a molecule with a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring, the SMILES would be something like c1c2ncccc2ccc1. In this case, the fused system would be the benzene (c1) and the pyrimidine (c2). So stripping all substituents, the SMILES would be c1cc2nc(nc)c2cc1. But I need to make sure the ring closures are correct. Another approach: use a tool like RDKit to parse the SMILES and extract the scaffold. But since I can't do that here, I have to reason it out. The key is to remove all substituents except the rings and connecting bonds. The input has two benzene rings (the main one and the c4 one), but the c4 is part of a side chain (attached via =C), so it's removed. The main rings are the benzene (c1) and the central six-membered ring (c2) with two nitrogens. The connecting bonds between these rings are kept. So the scaffold is the fused benzene and six-membered ring with two nitrogens. The SMILES would then be c1c2nc(nc)c2cc1. However, this might not capture the correct ring closures. Alternatively, maybe it's c1cc2nc(nc)c2cc1. Testing that in a SMILES validator would help, but I can't do that. Given the constraints, I'll go with the SMILES that represents the fused benzene and the six-membered ring with two nitrogens as the Murcko scaffold.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is Nc1c(C(=O)c2cccc(C(O)CO)c2)cnn1-c1ccc(F)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the ring systems. The molecule has two aromatic rings. The first part is a six-membered ring with nitrogen atoms\u2014probably a pyrimidine or similar. The second part is a benzene ring connected via an oxygen or another atom.\n\nNext, I should remove all side chains and functional groups. The carbonyl group (C=O), the hydroxyl (OH), the ethylene glycol chain (C(O)CO), and the fluorine substituent on the benzene ring are all side chains or substituents. These need to be stripped off.\n\nThe connecting bonds between the rings should remain. The rings are connected by a bond from the first ring's nitrogen to the second ring. Wait, the SMILES shows \"-c1ccc(F)cc1\" attached via an 'nn1' part. The n's are nitrogens in a ring. So the main rings are the two aromatic systems: one with the nitrogens in a ring (like a pyrimidine) and the benzene ring connected via the azo group (nn-)?\n\nWait, the structure is Nc1c(...)cnn1-c... The 'cnn1' suggests a ring with two adjacent nitrogens. So the first ring might be a triazole or similar. Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nBreaking down the SMILES: Nc1c(...)cnn1-c... The 'c1' starts a ring. The 'N' is attached to position 1. Then there's a carbon connected to a carbonyl group, which is part of another benzene ring (c2cccc(...)c2). Then the main ring continues with 'cnn1', so positions 1 (N), then a carbon, then two nitrogens (positions 3 and 4?), forming a ring closure at position 1. Then connected via a single bond to another benzene ring (c1ccc(F)cc1). \n\nThe Murcko scaffold should retain the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So the main rings are the triazole-like ring (with two nitrogens) and the benzene ring at the end. The connecting bond is between the triazole and the benzene via the 'nn1-c' part. The side chains like the carbonyl, the C(O)CO group, and the fluorine on the benzene should be removed.\n\nSo stripping off the substituents: the triazole ring (Nc1c...cnn1) becomes a simple ring without the substituents. The benzene ring attached via the single bond loses the fluorine. The middle benzene ring (from c2cccc(C(O)CO)c2) is a substituent on the triazole, so that entire benzene with the C(O)CO is a side chain and should be removed. Similarly, the fluorine on the end benzene is removed.\n\nSo the scaffold would be the triazole ring connected directly to the benzene ring. The triazole ring would have no substituents except the connecting bond to the benzene. The benzene ring would also have no substituents. Wait, but the connecting part is via the 'nn1-c...', so the benzene is connected via a single bond from the triazole's nitrogen? Or is there a linker?\n\nWait, the original SMILES is Nc1c(...)cnn1-c1ccc(F)cc1. The 'nn1' is part of the first ring. The '-c1ccc(F)cc1' is attached to the second nitrogen in the 'nn' part. So the triazole-like ring (maybe a 1,2,3-triazole?) is connected via one of its nitrogens to the benzene ring. So the scaffold would have the triazole ring fused or connected to the benzene via that single bond. But the benzene in the middle (from the C(=O)c2cccc(...)c2) is a substituent on the triazole's carbon. That entire part (C(=O)c2...) is a side chain and should be removed.\n\nSo the final scaffold should be the triazole ring (Nc1c...cnn1) without the substituents, connected to the benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1) without the fluorine. The middle benzene (from c2) and all other groups are stripped. So the scaffold would be Nc1cnn1-c1ccccc1. Wait, but the original connection is Nc1c(...)cnn1-c... So the triazole is N-C-C-N-N- as part of the ring. Let me check the actual structure again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main rings are the two benzene rings and the triazole. Wait, no. The input has three rings: the triazole (if that's a 5-membered ring with two nitrogens), the middle benzene (from c2), and the end benzene. But the Murcko scaffold only keeps the ring systems connected by linkers. The middle benzene is part of a side chain attached to the triazole, so it's removed. The end benzene is connected via a single bond, so that's part of the scaffold. So the scaffold is the triazole connected to the benzene via a single bond. So the SMILES would be Nc1cnn1c2ccccc2. But need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triazole is part of a larger ring? Let me parse the SMILES again step by step.\n\nThe SMILES is Nc1c(C(=O)c2cccc(C(O)CO)c2)cnn1-c1ccc(F)cc1.\n\nStarting from the first atom: N (amino group) attached to c1 (carbon 1 of ring 1). Then c1 is connected to another carbon (C(=O)...), which is part of a benzene ring (c2cccc...c2). Then back to ring 1: cnn1, meaning the ring closes at position 1. So the first ring is a 5-membered ring: N-C-C-N-N, forming a ring. That's a 1,2,3-triazole? Then connected via the last N to the benzene ring (c1ccc(F)cc1).\n\nSo the Murcko scaffold would retain the triazole ring and the benzene ring connected by the single bond. The substituents (C(=O)..., C(O)CO, F) are all removed. So the scaffold is Nc1cnn1c2ccccc2. However, in SMILES notation, the order matters. Let me write it properly. The triazole ring would be Nc1c...cnn1. Without substituents, it's Nc1cnn1. Then connected to benzene: -c2ccccc2. So combining: Nc1cnn1-c2ccccc2. But in SMILES, the benzene would be written as c1ccc... So maybe Nc1cnn1-c2ccccc2. Alternatively, the benzene is written as c1ccccc1. So the scaffold SMILES would be Nc1cnn1c2ccccc2. But need to ensure correct ring numbering and closure.\n\nAnother way: The triazole ring is N-C-C-N-N in a 5-membered ring. So SMILES would be Nc1ccnn1. Wait, no. Let's see: Starting with N attached to c1. Then c1 is connected to another carbon (position 2), which is connected to another carbon (position 3) which is connected to two nitrogens (positions 4 and 5), and then back to position 1. So the ring is 1 (N), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (N), 5 (N), forming a 5-membered ring. So the SMILES would be Nc1ccnn1. But in the original SMILES, the substituents are on position 2 (the C in the middle). So removing that substituent (C(=O)...), the triazole ring becomes Nc1c(C)cnn1? No, wait, the substituent is removed, so it's just Nc1c... but without the substituent. So it's Nc1c[...]cnn1, but the [...] is a carbon with no substituents. Wait, no, the substituent was the C(=O)..., so removing that, the carbon at position 2 becomes just a CH group. So the triazole ring would have N-C-CH-N-N, but in SMILES, that would be Nc1c(C)cnn1. But since the substituents are removed, the CH is just part of the ring. So the SMILES would be Nc1ccnn1. Because in the original, the C at position 2 has a substituent (C(=O)...), which is removed, leaving just the C connected to the ring. So the scaffold's triazole ring is N-C-C-N-N, written as Nc1ccnn1. Then connected to the benzene ring via the single bond: Nc1ccnn1-c2ccccc2. But in SMILES, the benzene can be written as c2ccccc2. So combining, the scaffold would be Nc1ccnn1c2ccccc2. However, when writing SMILES, the ring closures need to be correctly numbered. Alternatively, the correct SMILES might be Nc1cnn1c2ccccc2. Let me check with an example. For 1,2,3-triazole connected to benzene via the nitrogen: Let's say triazole is N1C=CN=N1. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps using RDKit to parse would help, but since I can't do that, I'll proceed logically.\n\nIn the original SMILES, the triazole ring is written as Nc1c(...)cnn1. So the ring closure is at position 1. The sequence is N connected to c1, then c1 connected to another c (position 2), which has substituents, then that c is connected to n (position 3), then another n (position 4), and then back to position 1. So the ring is 5-membered: positions 1 (N), 2 (C), 3 (N?), 4 (N?), and then closing back. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. This part is tricky without visualizing. Assuming the triazole is N-C-C-N-N forming a 5-membered ring, the SMILES would be Nc1ccnn1. Then connected to benzene: Nc1ccnn1-c2ccccc2. But in SMILES, the benzene can be written as c2ccccc2. So combining, the scaffold SMILES is Nc1ccnn1c2ccccc2. However, the original connection is via the last nitrogen. Wait, the original SMILES has \"-nn1-c...\", meaning the nitrogen at position 4 (nn1) is connected to the benzene. So the triazole's nitrogen (position 4) is connected to the benzene. Therefore, the correct SMILES would be Nc1cc(n2ccccc2)nn1. But that would imply the benzene is a substituent on the nitrogen. Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is Nc1c(CN2C3=CC=CC=C3)nnn1. No, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the correct scaffold is the triazole ring connected to the benzene via a single bond, with all substituents removed. So the SMILES would be Nc1ccnn1-c2ccccc2. However, SMILES notation allows writing this as Nc1ccnn1c2ccccc2, merging the two rings. But I need to ensure the correct connectivity. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is Nc1cnn1c2ccccc2. Testing this in a SMILES parser would help, but since I can't, I'll proceed with this structure.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, I need to find the Murcko scaffold for the given SMILES. Let me start by looking at the structure. The input molecule is O=C(NCC1CCCO1)C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1)NC(=O)c1ccccc1.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the rings. There's a benzene ring attached to a nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]), but the nitro group is a functional group, so I should remove that. The other benzene ring is part of the core. Then there's a five-membered ring (CCCO1) connected via an oxygen. Wait, the five-membered ring is part of the scaffold if it's part of the ring system. Let me check the connecting bonds. The main structure seems to have two benzene rings connected by a central chain with amide groups (NC(=O)). Murcko scaffold retains the rings and the connecting bonds. So, the amide groups (O=C-N) are functional groups and should be removed. The central connecting chain might be a single bond between the two benzene rings. Also, there's a cyclopentane-like ring (C1CCCO1) connected via an ethylene chain. But since the Murcko scaffold keeps only the ring systems and the bonds that connect them, I need to strip away the side chains. So, removing the nitro group, the oxygen in the five-membered ring (but wait, the five-membered ring itself is part of the scaffold?), the amide groups, and any other substituents. The core would be the two benzene rings connected by a single bond, and the five-membered ring (if it's part of the ring system). Wait, maybe the five-membered ring is part of a fused system? Let me visualize the structure again. The SMILES has NCC1CCCO1, which is a morpholine ring (oxygen in the ring) connected via a methylene group to the central part. That morpholine ring is a side chain, so it should be removed. The central part might have a benzene ring connected via a double bond (C(=C...)) but that's a functional group (double bond as part of a substituent). Wait, the Murcko scaffold includes the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So, any exocyclic double bonds would be removed. So, breaking down the structure, the main rings are two benzene rings. The central part has a C(=C...) which is an exocyclic double bond, so that's removed. The connecting bonds between the rings would be the single bonds. So the scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Let me check if there are other rings. The NCC1CCCO1 is a morpholine ring, which is a six-membered ring (but wait, C1CCCO1 is a five-membered ring: C-C-C-O-C, so five atoms). That's a side chain, so it's removed. The other substituents like nitro and oxygen rings are side chains. So the final Murcko scaffold is the two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Wait, but the original structure might have the benzene rings connected via a central carbon. Let me parse the SMILES again. The SMILES is O=C(NCC1CCCO1)C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1)NC(=O)c1ccccc1. Breaking it down: The central carbon is connected to two amide groups (O=C-N) and a double bond (C(=C...)). The left part is NCC1CCCO1 (morpholine?), the middle part is C(=C...) connected to a benzene with nitro, and the right part is NC(=O)c1ccccc1 (benzene with amide). To get the scaffold, remove all substituents except the rings and connecting bonds. The benzene rings are the two c1ccccc1 parts. The connecting bonds would be the central structure. But in the original molecule, the benzene rings are connected via the central C(=C...) which is a double bond. However, the Murcko scaffold requires removing exocyclic modifications. So, the double bond (as part of a substituent) would be removed, leaving the two benzene rings connected by a single bond through the central carbon. But wait, perhaps the connecting chain is part of the scaffold. For example, if there's a bridge or a chain that's part of the ring system. Alternatively, maybe the central part forms a ring. Wait, the SMILES doesn't show any other rings besides the benzene and the morpholine. So the main rings are the two benzene rings. The rest are side chains. So the Murcko scaffold would be two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Wait, but how are they connected? In the original structure, maybe they're connected via a central carbon that's part of a chain. If that chain is not part of a ring, then it's a connecting bond. But Murcko scaffold includes only the rings and the connecting bonds. So the connecting bonds are the minimum necessary to link the rings. If the benzene rings are connected via a single bond (like biphenyl), then that's the scaffold. But in the input, the connection might be through a carbon chain. Let me think again. The central part is C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1), which is a carbonyl group connected to a benzene ring with a nitro group. The other part is NC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is another benzene ring. So the core structure would be the two benzene rings connected via the central carbonyl and amide groups. But those are functional groups, so they should be removed. Therefore, the rings are not directly connected, but via a chain that's part of the functional groups. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to use a tool or algorithm to extract the scaffold properly. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to remove all substituents except the rings and the bonds that connect them. So, any atom that is part of a ring is kept, and any bonds that are between rings are kept. Non-ring atoms and bonds are removed. So for the input molecule, the rings are the benzene rings and the morpholine ring. Wait, the morpholine is a five-membered ring with oxygen, but it's connected via a side chain (NCC1CCCO1). So that's a side chain, so the morpholine ring is a side chain and should be removed. The nitro group is a substituent on the benzene, so remove that. The amide groups (O=C-N) are substituents, remove them. The central part has a C(=C...), which is a substituent, so remove that. So the remaining rings are the two benzene rings. But how are they connected? If they are not directly connected, then the scaffold would be each benzene ring as separate, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the central part has a carbon chain that connects the two benzene rings. If that chain is part of the scaffold, but the definition says to remove side chains. So the connecting bonds are only those that are part of the ring systems. If the benzene rings are connected via a single bond, then that's the scaffold. Otherwise, if they are connected via a chain that's not part of a ring, then those chains are removed. Wait, perhaps the correct scaffold is the two benzene rings connected via a single bond. But in the original molecule, they might be connected through a central structure that's not part of a ring. In that case, the scaffold would be the two benzene rings without any connection. But that doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me try to draw it. The SMILES is O=C(NCC1CCCO1)C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1)NC(=O)c1ccccc1. The central carbon is connected to two amide groups (O=C-N-), a double bond to a benzene with nitro, and another amide group connected to a benzene. So the core is the two benzene rings connected via the central carbon and the double bond. But according to Murcko, we need to remove all functional groups and side chains, leaving only rings and connecting bonds. So the central carbon and double bond would be part of the connecting bonds. Wait, but if the connecting bonds are not part of a ring, they are kept. So the Murcko scaffold includes the rings and the connecting bonds, even if they are single bonds. So in this case, the two benzene rings are connected via a central carbon (from the C(=C...) part. But that carbon is part of a chain, not a ring. So would that chain be considered a connecting bond? The definition says connecting bonds, which are the bonds that link the ring systems. So the two benzene rings are connected via a chain of atoms. But the Murcko scaffold would remove all atoms in the chain except the minimum necessary to connect the rings. For example, if there's a chain of two carbons between two rings, the scaffold would replace that with a single bond. Wait, no. The Murcko scaffold is obtained by removing side chains and functional groups, but keeping the ring systems and the bonds that connect them. So any atoms that are part of the path connecting two rings are kept. Wait, no, that's not correct. The Murcko scaffold is formed by converting all acyclic atoms between rings into single bonds. So, for example, if you have two rings connected by a chain of three carbons, the scaffold would be the two rings connected by a single bond. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the actual algorithm is to retain only the ring atoms and the bridge atoms between rings, converting other connecting chains into single bonds. Alternatively, the original paper by Bemis and Murcko defines the scaffold as the union of all rings and the linker atoms that connect them. Linker atoms are those that are part of the shortest path between two rings. So in this case, the two benzene rings are connected via a path. Let's parse the molecule again. The left benzene ring (c1ccccc1) is connected via an amide group (NC(=O)), then the central carbon (C(=C...)), which connects to another benzene ring (c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1) via a double bond and a methyl group. The nitro group is a substituent on that benzene. So the path between the two benzene rings is through the central carbon and the double bond. The amide groups are functional groups, so they are removed. The nitro group is removed. The morpholine ring is a side chain, so removed. The connecting path would be the central carbon and the double bond. But since those are acyclic, they would be converted into a single bond. So the Murcko scaffold would be two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Alternatively, if the connecting path includes the central carbon and the double bond, but those are considered as part of the linker, then the linker is the shortest path between the two rings. In this case, the shortest path between the two benzene rings is through the central carbon (C) and the double bond (C=C), but that's a bit unclear. Wait, the left benzene is connected via NC(=O)-C(=C...)-C... to the right benzene. The NC(=O) is a functional group, so it's removed. So the connecting path would be the central carbon (from the C(=C...)) connected to the right benzene. But without the functional groups, the scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by a single bond through that central carbon. So the final SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)-c1ccccc1. Wait, but that's biphenyl. But in the original molecule, are the two benzene rings directly connected? No, they're connected via a central structure. So maybe the correct scaffold is two benzene rings connected via a single bond. Therefore, the output should be c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the central part forms a ring, but I don't see that. Another approach: use RDKit to process the SMILES and extract the scaffold. But since I can't do that here, I'll proceed with my best guess. The final answer is the two benzene rings connected by a single bond, so the SMILES is c1ccccc1c2ccccc2. Wait, no, that's two benzene rings connected by a single bond, which is c1ccccc1c2ccccc2. But SMILES notation for biphenyl is c1ccccc1c2ccccc2. So that's the scaffold. Therefore, the Output Scaffold should be \"c1ccccc1c2ccccc2\".",

The molecule has a core ring system. Let me break it down. The main part is the bicyclic system: c1ccc2cc...ncc2c1. That looks like a benzene ring fused with another ring, maybe a pyridine or similar since there's an 'n' in there. So the rings are connected, forming a fused bicyclic system.\n\nNow, the side chains and functional groups. The main chain attached is CC(C)=C. That's an isopropyl group attached via a double bond. Then there's NC(=O)C3CC3. The NC(=O) is an amide group, and the C3CC3 is a cyclopropane ring. So the amide is connected to the cyclopropane.\n\nTo get the Murcko scaffold, I need to remove all those side chains. So the substituents on the rings should be stripped off. The benzene ring has the CC(C)=C group, which is a side chain. The 'cc(NC(=O)...)' part means there's an amino group attached to the ring, which is part of the amide functional group. Those should be removed, leaving just the ring systems and the connecting bonds.\n\nThe connecting bonds between the rings are part of the scaffold. So the fused rings stay. The side chains like the isopropyl group and the amide-cyclopropane group are removed. The resulting scaffold would be the fused bicyclic system without any substituents.\n\nChecking again: the original SMILES is CC(C)=Cc1ccc2cc(NC(=O)C3CC3)ncc2c1. The rings are c1ccc2cc...ncc2c1. Removing substituents on the rings (the CC(C)=C and NC(=O)C3CC3 parts), the scaffold becomes c1ccc2cncc2c1. Wait, but the exact positions matter. Let me ensure the connectivity. The original structure is a benzene ring (c1ccc...) fused to a pyridine-like ring (with the 'n'). So the Murcko scaffold should be the fused bicyclic system with the nitrogen in the second ring. So the correct SMILES would be c1ccc2cnccc2c1? Or maybe with the nitrogen in a different position. Let me count the atoms. Starting from the benzene ring: positions 1 (attached to CC(C)=C), then positions 2, 3, 4 leading to the fused ring. The fused ring has positions 2, then cc(NC(=O)...)ncc2. So the nitrogen is in the ortho position relative to the fusion point. So the scaffold SMILES should be c1ccc2cnccc2c1. Wait, but the original SMILES has \"cc2cc(NC(=O)...)ncc2c1\". So the second ring has a nitrogen. Let me reconstruct: the benzene ring (c1ccc2...) is fused to a pyridine ring (the 'n' in the second ring). So the Murcko scaffold is the fused benzene and pyridine rings without substituents. Therefore, the SMILES is c1ccc2cnccc2c1. But I need to make sure the order and connectivity. Alternatively, maybe c1ccc2c(ccn2)c1. Hmm. Let me write the scaffold as the two fused rings with the nitrogen in the correct position. The original structure after removing substituents would have the rings connected, so the correct SMILES should be c1ccc2cnccc2c1. But to confirm, perhaps using a tool would help, but since I'm doing this manually, I have to be careful. The key is that all side chains are removed, leaving only the rings and the bonds between them. So the final answer should be the fused benzene and pyridine rings, which in SMILES would be c1ccc2cnccc2c1.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let me try to figure out the Murcko scaffold for this molecule. The input SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2)cc1. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the ring systems. Looking at the SMILES, there are a few rings. The main part is the benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1). Then there's a six-membered ring with oxygen (O connected to C2CCN...). Wait, the part after O is OC2CCN(...)C2, which forms a ring with the C2 atoms. That's a five-membered ring? Let me check: O-C2-C-C-N connected back to C2. So the ring is O, then C2, C, C, N, and back to C2. That makes a five-membered ring: O-C-C-C-N-C2, but wait, the numbering might be different. Maybe it's a morpholine-like ring?\n\nThen there's another ring in the c3nc(...)ncc3F part. The c3 is part of a pyridine ring? Let's see: c3 is connected to N, then C, which has a substituent. The N4CCCC4C part: N4 connected to four CH2 groups and a C. That forms a six-membered ring, maybe piperidine or similar. So N4-C-C-C-C-C4, but with a methyl group attached?\n\nSo the rings are the benzene (c1ccc...cc1), the five-membered ring (O-C2-C-C-N-C2), the pyridine ring (c3nc...ncc3F), and the six-membered ring (N4CCCC4C). \n\nNow, I need to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. The benzene has an oxygen connected to the five-membered ring. The five-membered ring is connected to the pyridine via the N. The pyridine has a fluorine substituent, which is a functional group, so that should be removed. The six-membered ring (piperidine-like) has a methyl group (the C at the end of N4CCCC4C) which is exocyclic, so remove that. The acetamide group (CC(=O)NC(C)) attached to the benzene is a side chain, so remove that. The OC2... part is part of the connecting rings, so keep that. \n\nSo the scaffold should consist of the benzene ring connected via an oxygen to the five-membered ring (O-C-C-C-N), which is connected to the pyridine ring. The pyridine is connected to the six-membered ring (piperidine without the methyl). Wait, the N4CCCC4C has a methyl (C) at the end. Since that's exocyclic, remove it, leaving N4CCCC4 (but that would be a five-membered ring?), no, wait N4 connected to four CH2 groups and a C. If we remove the exocyclic C (the last C in N4CCCC4C), then the ring becomes N4-C-C-C-C-C (five carbons?), but that would make a six-membered ring with N. So the original ring is N4-C-C-C-C-C, forming a six-membered ring. But the SMILES is N4CCCC4C. Wait, maybe the C after 4 is part of the ring? Let me parse that: N4C-C-C-C-4C. So the ring is N connected to four CH2 groups and then back to C? That doesn't form a ring. Wait, maybe I'm misreading. The part is N4CCCC4C: the N4 is connected to the first C, then three more Cs, then back to C4 (the fourth atom in the ring). Wait, SMILES notation for rings: the numbers indicate the positions. So N4C-C-C-C-4C would mean that the N is atom 4, connected to the first C (atom 1), then C (2), C (3), C (4), and then back to C (4 again?), which doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to re-express this. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but assuming the input is correct, perhaps the six-membered ring is N connected to four CH2 groups and a CH2 group, forming a ring. But this is getting complicated. Maybe the key point is that any exocyclic groups (like the methyl on the N4 ring) should be removed. So the N4CCCC4C becomes N4CCCC4, forming a five-membered ring? Or wait, if it's N4 followed by CCCC4C, that would be a ring closure between N4 and the fourth C, making a five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C), but then the last C is outside? Hmm. Maybe I should focus on removing all substituents except the rings and connecting bonds. So the main rings are the benzene, the five-membered (O-containing), the pyridine, and the six-membered (N4) ring. The connecting bonds are the oxygen between benzene and the five-membered ring, the N connecting the five-membered to the pyridine, and the N connecting the pyridine to the six-membered ring. So the scaffold would be the benzene linked via O to the five-membered ring, which is linked via N to the pyridine, which is linked via N to the six-membered ring. The exocyclic groups like F on the pyridine, the methyl on the six-membered ring, and the acetamide on the benzene are all removed. \n\nSo the resulting SMILES would be the rings connected by the bonds. The benzene is c1ccc(OC2CCNc3ncncc3)C2)cc1. Wait, but the original pyridine part was c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F. After removing F and the N4 substituent (the exocyclic C), the pyridine becomes c3ncncc3, but connected to the N from the five-membered ring. Wait, the original structure has N(c3...) so after removing the substituents on the pyridine (F and the N4 group), the pyridine is just c3ncncc3. But wait, the N in the pyridine is connected to the N4 ring. So in the scaffold, the pyridine's N is connected to the six-membered ring (N4...). But if the six-membered ring's exocyclic C is removed, then the N4 ring becomes a five-membered ring? Or perhaps the N4 ring is part of the scaffold. Let me try to reconstruct:\n\nOriginal SMILES parts:\n\nMain benzene: c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2)cc1\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- Benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1) with substituent O connected to C2.\n\n- The O is part of a ring: OC2CCN(...)C2, which forms a five-membered ring (O-C2-C-C-N-C2).\n\n- The N in that ring is connected to a pyridine ring (c3nc(...)ncc3F). The pyridine has substituents: F and N4CCCC4C.\n\n- The N4CCCC4C is a six-membered ring (N connected to four CH2 groups and a C, which is exocyclic). So removing the exocyclic C, the ring becomes N4CCCC4, which is a five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C). Wait, no: N4 is connected to four CH2 groups (each C is CH2?), so N-C-C-C-C would be five atoms, forming a pyrrolidine-like ring. But the original is N4CCCC4C, which is N-C-C-C-C-C, forming a six-membered ring with the last C being exocyclic. Wait, maybe the SMILES is N4C-C-C-C-C4C. The ring closure is between N4 and the fourth C, making a five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C), and the last C is outside. So removing that exocyclic C, the ring becomes N4C-C-C-C, which would be a four-membered ring, but that doesn't make sense. I'm getting confused here. Perhaps the correct approach is to remove all side chains, keeping only the rings and the connecting atoms. So the N4CCCC4C part: the N is part of a ring, but the C after 4 is exocyclic. So we remove that C, leaving the ring as N4CCCC4, which is a five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C). But that's five atoms, so a five-membered ring. So the scaffold would include this ring.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nBenzene -> O -> five-membered ring (O-C-C-C-N) -> N connected to pyridine (c3ncncc3) -> pyridine's N connected to the five-membered ring (N4CCCC4). Wait, no, the pyridine's N is connected to the N4 ring. So the scaffold is benzene-O-[five-membered ring]-N-pyridine-N-[five-membered ring N4CCCC4]?\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the N4CCCC4C is part of the scaffold as a six-membered ring without the exocyclic C. But how? Let me try writing the SMILES for the scaffold step by step.\n\nOriginal: CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2)cc1\n\nRemove side chains:\n\n- The CC(=O)NC(C) attached to the benzene (c1) is a side chain, so remove it. So the benzene becomes c1ccc(OC2CCN(...)C2)cc1.\n\n- The OC2CCN(...)C2 is part of the scaffold, forming a ring. So O connected to C2, then C-C-N connected back to C2, forming a five-membered ring.\n\n- The N in that ring is connected to c3nc(...)ncc3F. The F is a substituent, so remove it. The pyridine becomes c3ncncc3.\n\n- The pyridine's N is connected to N4CCCC4C. The exocyclic C here is a substituent, so remove it. The ring becomes N4CCCC4, which is a five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C). But in SMILES, that would be N41CCCC1. Wait, maybe N4C1CCCC14? No, ring closures need unique numbers. Let me adjust. Suppose the N4 is part of a five-membered ring: N4C1CCCC14. But I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the N4 ring is a piperidine (six-membered) but without the exocyclic methyl. Wait, the original N4CCCC4C would form a six-membered ring if the closure is between N4 and the last C. For example, N4-C-C-C-C-C4 would be a six-membered ring. But the SMILES is written as N4CCCC4C, which might be N4-C-C-C-C4-C. That would mean the ring closure is between N4 and the fourth C, making a five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C), and then another C attached. So the exocyclic C is removed, leaving the five-membered ring N4-C-C-C-C.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe scaffold SMILES should be c1ccc(OC2CCNc3ncncc3C2)cc1 connected to the N4 ring. Wait, how is the pyridine connected to the N4 ring? The original pyridine has a N connected to N4CCCC4C. After removing the exocyclic C, it's N4CCCC4. So the pyridine's N is connected to the N4 ring. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1. But wait, the original pyridine's N is connected to the N4 ring. So in the scaffold, the pyridine's N is part of the connection, so the structure is benzene-O-[five-membered ring]-N-(pyridine-N-[five-membered N4 ring]). But I need to make sure all exocyclic groups are removed. Let me check again:\n\n- Benzene with O connected to the five-membered ring (O-C2-C-C-N-C2).\n\n- The N in that ring is connected to the pyridine (c3nc(...)ncc3). The pyridine's substituents F and the N4 group are handled.\n\n- The F is removed, so pyridine becomes c3ncncc3.\n\n- The N in the pyridine is connected to the N4 ring. The original N4 ring had N4CCCC4C. Removing the exocyclic C, it becomes N4CCCC4, which is a five-membered ring. So the pyridine's N is connected to this five-membered ring.\n\nThus, the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1.\n\nWait, but in the original SMILES, the pyridine's N is connected to the N4 ring. So in the scaffold, that connection remains. So the final SMILES is:\n\nc1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1\n\nBut I need to check the ring closures. Let me write it step by step:\n\nStart with benzene: c1ccc(...)cc1. The ... is OC2CCN(...)C2.\n\nThe OC2CCN(...)C2 part forms a five-membered ring: O-C2-C-C-N-C2. So the SMILES for that ring is O1C(C)CN1. Wait, no. Let me use numbers properly. For the five-membered ring: O is connected to C2, which is connected to two more Cs, then N, then back to C2. So the SMILES would be O1C2CCN1C2. Wait, maybe O-C2-C-C-N-C2. The numbering would be O1-C2-C3-C4-N1-C2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the five-membered ring can be represented as O1CCCN1. But with the benzene attached. So the benzene is c1ccc(O2CCCN2)cc1. Then, the N in the five-membered ring is connected to the pyridine. The pyridine is c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3. Then, the pyridine's N is connected to the five-membered ring N4CCCC4.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nc1ccc(O2CCCN2c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)cc1\n\nBut I need to check the ring closures and ensure all numbers are correct. For example, the five-membered ring connected to O is O2C3CCN2C3. Wait, maybe O2C(C)CN2. Alternatively, maybe O[C@H]1CCCN1. But I'm not sure. The exact SMILES might require correct ring numbering.\n\nAlternatively, using RDKit to parse and generate the scaffold would be more accurate, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll proceed.\n\nSo the final scaffold SMILES should be c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1.\n\nBut let me check for any remaining substituents. The pyridine's N is connected to the N4 ring, which is part of the scaffold. The N4 ring is a five-membered ring (N connected to four CH2 groups), so N4CCCC4. That would be N1CCCC1. So the SMILES for that part is N1CCCC1.\n\nSo the pyridine part is c3nc(N1CCCC1)ncc3.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nBenzene with O connected to the five-membered ring, which connects to the pyridine, which connects to the five-membered N ring. So the full SMILES is c1ccc(O2CCCN2c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)cc1.\n\nBut I need to make sure all ring closures are correctly numbered. Let me adjust the numbers to avoid duplication. For example:\n\nBenzene: c1ccc(O2CCCN2c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)cc1.\n\nHere, the O is part of ring closure 2, the N4 is part of ring closure 4. Each ring has unique numbers. The five-membered oxygen ring is O2C-C-C-N2. The N4 ring is N4C-C-C-C4.\n\nSo the final SMILES would be c1ccc(O2CCCN2c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)cc1.",

First, I need to identify the rings and connecting bonds.\n\nLooking at the structure, there's a central ring connected to other parts. The main steps are to strip off side chains and functional groups. The central ring system is probably the bicyclic part. The Oc2ccccc2 is an attached oxygen with a benzene ring, which is a side chain. The -c2ccc(...) part connects to another benzene ring with substituents. The -c3cnc(N)nc3 looks like a triazole ring, but the NH2 group is a functional group, so that gets removed. The fluorine (F) on the benzene is also a substituent and should be taken off. The methyl group (Cc1...) is another side chain. \n\nAfter removing all those, the remaining scaffold would be the central ring connected via the linking bonds. The core should be the two fused rings: the pyridine (from c1ccncn1) and the benzene connected via the oxygen's position. Wait, no, the oxygen is part of the side chain. So the actual Murcko scaffold would be the central bicyclic system without the substituents. Let me check again. The original molecule has a central ring (maybe a pyridine or similar) connected via an oxygen to another benzene, but that benzene is a side chain. The key is to keep only the ring systems and the bonds that connect them. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the core is the two rings connected by the single bond from the oxygen, but the oxygen itself is part of the connecting structure. Wait, the definition says to leave ring systems and connecting bonds. So rings connected by a bond (like a single bond between two rings) would be part of the scaffold. But substituents on those rings (like F, methyl, etc.) should be removed. So in this case, the main scaffold would be the central ring (like the five-membered ring with N) connected via an oxygen to a benzene ring, which is connected to another benzene ring. Wait, maybe not. Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nThe SMILES is Cc1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(-c3cnc(N)nc3)c(F)c2)n1. Breaking it down: the main ring is the six-membered ring (c1ccnc...n1), which is a pyridine-like ring (since there's an 'n' in there). Attached to the oxygen (O) is a benzene ring (c2ccccc2), which is connected via a single bond to another benzene ring (c2ccc...c2), which has substituents like -c3cnc(N)nc3 (a triazole with NH2) and F. The Murcko scaffold should retain the rings and the connecting bonds. So the main rings are the pyridine (c1ccncn1?), the benzene (from Oc2ccccc2), and another benzene (from the -c2ccc part). Wait, but the connecting bonds are the ones between the rings. So the scaffold would be the pyridine ring connected via O to the first benzene, which is connected via a single bond to the second benzene. However, substituents on those rings (like the methyl on the pyridine, the fluorine on the second benzene, and the triazole substituent) should be removed. So the final scaffold is the pyridine linked via O to a benzene, which is linked to another benzene. But in the original structure, the second benzene (from the -c2ccc part) is connected to the first benzene via a single bond (the -c2ccc... part is part of the same benzene as the first one? Wait, maybe I need to draw this out mentally. The SMILES can be tricky. Let's parse it again: Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)c(F)c2. The part after the O is Oc2ccccc2, which is a benzene ring attached via oxygen. Then connected via a single bond (the '-') to another benzene ring (c2ccc...c2). That second benzene has substituents: a -c3cnc(N)nc3 group and a fluorine. So the Murcko scaffold would include the pyridine ring (from the main chain), connected via O to the first benzene, which is connected to the second benzene. But all substituents (methyl, fluorine, triazole) are removed. So the scaffold would be the pyridine-O-benzene-benzene? Wait, no. The connecting bonds are between the rings. So the rings are the pyridine, the first benzene (from O), and the second benzene (from the '-c2ccc' part). But actually, the '-c2ccc...' part is part of the same benzene as the first one? No, because after the '-', it's a new ring (c2...). Wait, in SMILES notation, the same atom number (c2) would indicate a new ring. So Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)c(F)c2 means that the oxygen is connected to a benzene (c2), then a single bond to another benzene (c2 again, but since it's a new ring, it's a different one). So the structure is O-linked to benzene A, which is connected via a single bond to benzene B. Benzene B has substituents, but those are removed. So the Murcko scaffold would be the pyridine ring connected via O to benzene A, which is connected via a single bond to benzene B. But wait, the single bond between the two benzene rings is part of the connecting structure, so it's retained. Therefore, the scaffold includes those three rings connected via the O and the single bond. Wait, but the definition says to leave only the ring systems and connecting bonds. So the rings are benzene A, benzene B, and the pyridine. The connecting bonds are the O between pyridine and benzene A, and the single bond between benzene A and B. So the scaffold would be the pyridine connected via O to benzene A, which is connected via single bond to benzene B. Then, all substituents on those rings (like methyl on pyridine, fluorine on benzene B, and the triazole substituent) are removed. So the final scaffold SMILES would be O(c1ccccc1)c1ccc(cc1)c1cccnc1. Wait, but I need to check. Let me reconstruct. The original structure's scaffold would be the central pyridine (from c1ccnc...n1) connected via oxygen to a benzene (Oc2ccccc2), which is connected via a single bond to another benzene (c2ccc...c2). But in the SMILES, the part after the oxygen is Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)c(F)c2. So the benzene A (Oc2ccccc2) is connected via single bond to benzene B (c2ccc...c2). Then benzene B has substituents, which are removed. So the scaffold would be the pyridine connected to benzene A via O, and benzene A connected to benzene B via a single bond. But the benzene B in the scaffold would have the substituents removed. So the SMILES for the scaffold would be O(c1ccccc1)c1ccc(cc1)c1cccnc1. Wait, but how are the rings connected? Let me think. The original SMILES is Cc1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(-c3cnc(N)nc3)c(F)c2)n1. The scaffold would remove the methyl (Cc1... becomes c1...), the fluorine (c(F) becomes c), and the -c3cnc(N)nc3 substituent (so the -c... becomes a single bond). So the benzene B (from c2ccc...) becomes c2ccc(cc2) after removing substituents. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccncc1Oc2ccccc2c3ccc(cc3). Wait, but that's not correct. Let me reassemble. The pyridine ring is c1ccnc(O...)n1. Removing the methyl (C), it becomes c1ccncc1. The part after O is Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)c(F)c2. Removing substituents on benzene B (the -c3cnc... and F), the benzene B becomes c2ccc(cc2). But the connection is benzene A (Oc2ccccc2) connected via single bond to benzene B (c2ccc...). So the O connects to benzene A, which is connected to benzene B. So the entire scaffold would be c1ccncc1-O-c2ccccc2-c3ccc(cc3). But in SMILES notation, the single bond between benzene A and B is represented by the '-', so the scaffold SMILES would be O(c1ccccc1)c1ccc(cc1)c1cccnc1. Wait, but how to represent the two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccncc1Oc2ccccc2c3ccc(cc3). But I need to ensure proper ring closure. Alternatively, using different indices: O(c1ccccc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3cccnc3. Let me check. The pyridine is c3cccnc3. The O is attached to the benzene (c1ccccc1), which is connected via a single bond to another benzene (c2ccc(cc2)). So the SMILES would be O(c1ccccc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3cccnc3. But how are the rings connected? The oxygen is attached to the pyridine's position, then the benzene, then the other benzene. Wait, the original structure's oxygen is attached to the pyridine's ring. Let me re-express the original SMILES: The main ring is c1ccnc(O...)n1. So the pyridine has an oxygen substituent at position whatever. The oxygen is connected to benzene A (c2ccccc2), which is connected via a single bond to benzene B (c2ccc(...)c(F)c2). After removing substituents, benzene B is c2ccc(cc2). So the scaffold is the pyridine connected via O to benzene A, which is connected to benzene B. So the SMILES would be c1cc(Oc2ccccc2c3ccc(cc3))ncc1. But ring closures need proper numbering. Alternatively, O(c1ccccc1)(c2ccc(cc2))c3cccnc3. Not sure. Maybe better to write it as c1ccc2c(c1)OC(c1ccccc1)=C2. No, perhaps not. Alternatively, break it down step by step. The core is three rings connected via bonds: pyridine-O-benzene-benzene. So the SMILES would be O(c1ccccc1c2ccc(cc2))c3cccnc3. Wait, but how to connect the benzene rings. Let me try building the SMILES properly. Starting with the pyridine ring: c1ccncc1. Then the oxygen is attached to one of the carbons in the pyridine. Let's say position 4 (arbitrary, but the actual position depends on the original SMILES). The oxygen connects to benzene A: O(c2ccccc2). Then benzene A is connected via a single bond to benzene B: O(c2ccccc2-c3ccc(cc3)). So combining: c1ccncc1-O-c2ccccc2-c3ccc(cc3). However, in SMILES notation, the single bonds can be implicit. So maybe O(c1ccccc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3cccnc3. But that might not properly connect the rings. Alternatively, using ring closures: c1cc(Oc2ccccc2c3ccc(cc3))ncc1. But need to ensure correct numbering. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the correct scaffold SMILES is c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2c3ccc(cc3))n1. Let me check. Original pyridine is c1ccnc(O...)n1. After removing substituents except the O and connected rings, the O is connected to benzene A (c2ccccc2) which is connected to benzene B (c3ccc(cc3)). So the SMILES would be c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2c3ccc(cc3))n1. Yes, that makes sense. The benzene A and B are connected via a single bond, so in SMILES that's written as c2ccccc2c3ccc(cc3). Then the oxygen connects that to the pyridine. So the final scaffold is c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2c3ccc(cc3))n1. Let me check with the original structure. Original: Cc1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(-c3cnc(N)nc3)c(F)c2)n1. The methyl (C) is removed, fluorine (F) is removed, and the -c3cnc(N)nc3 group is removed. So the benzene B becomes c2ccc(cc2) instead of c2ccc(-c3...)c(F)c2. So the scaffold would have the O connected to benzene A (c2ccccc2) which is connected via a single bond to benzene B (c3ccc(cc3)). So the correct SMILES is O(c1ccccc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3cccnc3? No, that's three separate rings. Wait, no. The benzene A and B are connected by a single bond, so in SMILES, that's O(c1ccccc1-c2ccc(cc2))c3cccnc3. But the hyphen indicates a single bond between the two benzene rings. So the full SMILES would be c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c3ccc(cc3))n1. That seems correct. Yes, because the oxygen is attached to the pyridine's carbon, then the benzene A (c2ccccc2) connected via single bond to benzene B (c3ccc(cc3)). So the scaffold SMILES is c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c3ccc(cc3))n1. But I need to confirm the ring closures. The pyridine is c1ccnc...n1. The oxygen is on the fourth carbon (assuming the order is c1 c c n c O...). Wait, the original SMILES is Cc1ccnc(O...)n1. So the pyridine is c1 connected to a methyl (which we remove), then two carbons, then an n, then a c connected to O, then another n, then back to c1. So the pyridine ring is c1[c][c]n[c(O...)]n1. Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES for the pyridine part is c1cnccc1O... but I'm not sure. Regardless, the main point is that the scaffold includes the pyridine, the two benzene rings connected via single bond, and the oxygen linking the pyridine to the first benzene. So the correct SMILES should be c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2c3ccc(cc3))n1. Let me see. The Oc2ccccc2 part is connected to the pyridine. Then the c2ccccc2 is connected via a single bond to c3ccc(cc3). So in SMILES, that's Oc2ccccc2-c3ccc(cc3). Therefore, the entire scaffold SMILES is c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c3ccc(cc3))n1. Yes, that makes sense. Each ring is properly closed, and the connecting bonds are represented. So the final answer should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c3ccc(cc3))n1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to find the Murcko scaffold for the given SMILES: CCc1ccccc1NC(=O)Cn1nc(CC)n2c(cc3sccc32)c1=O. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Murcko scaffold involves retaining only the ring systems and the connecting bonds between them. All side chains and functional groups should be removed. Let me parse the SMILES to identify the rings and their connections.\n\nLooking at the SMILES, there are several parts. The main structure starts with CCc1ccccc1, which is a benzene ring with an ethyl group (CC) attached. Then there's NC(=O)C, which is an amide group. Following that is a more complex part: n1nc(CC)n2c(cc3sccc32)c1=O. This seems to have multiple rings. Let's dissect this.\n\nThe n1nc... part suggests a ring with nitrogen atoms. The (CC) here is a side chain (ethyl), so that should be removed. The c(cc3sccc32) part has a sulfur atom in a ring (sccc3), which is a thiophene ring. The c1=O at the end is a carbonyl group, which is a functional group and should be removed.\n\nSo, the rings present are the benzene (c1ccccc1), a diazepine-like ring (from n1nc...n2...c1=O?), and the thiophene (sccc3). But wait, the carbonyl (O) and the amide (NC(=O)) are functional groups. Also, the ethyl groups (CC and CC) are side chains. Let me remove those.\n\nStarting with the benzene ring: remove the ethyl (CC), leaving the benzene. Then, the NC(=O)C part: the amide is a functional group, so remove the N and the C(=O), leaving just the connecting bond. Then the next part: the n1nc...n2...c1=O. The ethyl (CC) attached to the nc should be removed. The thiophene ring (sccc3) is part of the structure connected via the n2. The carbonyl (=O) on the c1 should be removed.\n\nPutting it all together: the benzene ring connected via a bond (from the original NC(=O)C, now just a single bond) to the diazepine-like ring which is fused with the thiophene. Wait, need to check the connectivity. The n1 and n2 are part of a ring? Let me visualize. The structure after removing side chains would be the benzene ring connected to a bicyclic system comprising a diazepine ring fused with a thiophene. The exact connectivity needs to be verified.\n\nSo, the Murcko scaffold should include the benzene ring, the fused diazepine-thiophene rings, and the connecting bonds between them. Removing all substituents like ethyl, amide, and carbonyl groups. The resulting SMILES would be c1ccc2ncn3c2c1Sc4ccccc34. Wait, maybe. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene is connected via a single bond to the other ring system. But I need to ensure that all connecting bonds between rings are kept. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the benzene is part of a larger fused system. Wait, the original SMILES is CCc1ccccc1NC(=O)Cn1nc(CC)n2c(cc3sccc32)c1=O. Breaking down:\n\n- The benzene is c1ccccc1, connected to N. Then the amide C(=O)C connects to a nitrogen in the next ring: n1nc... So the connecting bond between benzene and the next ring is through the N-C bond. But since the amide is a functional group, that N would be removed. Wait, maybe not. The Murcko scaffold keeps the rings and the connecting bonds. So if the benzene is connected via a bond (from the original N-C) to the next ring, that bond is retained. But the N itself is part of the ring? Let me see.\n\nWait, the SMILES after the benzene is NC(=O)Cn1nc... So the N is part of the amide group. The C(=O) is a carbonyl, which is a functional group. So the N and the carbonyl should be removed. The connecting bond would be between the benzene and the next ring (the C attached to the N). But if that C is part of a ring, then it's retained. Wait, the next part is Cn1nc..., which is a carbon connected to a nitrogen in a ring (n1). So the benzene is connected via a single bond to a carbon which is part of another ring. Therefore, the connecting bond (the single bond between benzene and that carbon) is part of the scaffold. But that carbon is part of the ring? Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nThe part after the benzene is NC(=O)Cn1nc(CC)n2c(cc3sccc32)c1=O. Breaking this down:\n\n- NC(=O): amide group, which is a functional group. So the N here is part of the side chain and should be removed. The C(=O) is also a functional group, so removed. The next C is connected to n1 (a nitrogen in a ring). So the benzene is connected via a single bond to the C, which is part of the ring starting with n1. But wait, the C is part of the ring? Let's see: the ring is n1nc(CC)... So the ring starts with n1, then n, then c(CC), etc. Wait, the ring is n1, n, c, etc., forming a ring. The C that's attached to the benzene is outside this ring. So perhaps the connecting bond is between the benzene and the C, which is part of the next ring. Wait, perhaps the C is part of the ring. Let me write the ring closure. The part is Cn1nc(CC)n2c(...)c1=O. The c1 at the end refers back to n1, so the ring is n1-n-C(...)-n2-...-c1=O. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, the ring is formed by n1, then n, then c (with substituents), then n2, then c (with substituents), and closing back to n1 via c1=O. Hmm. This seems complex. Maybe it's a 7-membered ring? For example, n1 is the first atom, then n, then c (from nc), then the (CC) is a substituent, then n2, then c (from n2c), then a bridge to the thiophene ring (cc3sccc32), and then back to c1=O. But the c1=O is part of the same ring as n1. So the ring would be n1 connected to n, connected to c (with substituent CC), connected to n2, connected to c (with substituent cc3sccc32), connected to some other atoms, then back to c1=O, which connects back to n1. That would make a 7-membered ring? Maybe. But regardless, the key is to retain the rings and connecting bonds.\n\nSo, the benzene ring is connected via a single bond to a carbon which is part of a larger ring system that includes the thiophene. The ethyl groups (CC), the amide groups (NC(=O)), and the carbonyl (=O) should be removed. The resulting scaffold would be the benzene ring connected to the fused ring system of the diazepine (or similar) and thiophene. Let me try to write the SMILES for that. The benzene is c1ccccc1. The connecting bond is to a carbon that's part of a ring. The next ring system is a fusion between a diazepine-like ring and a thiophene. The thiophene is sccc3, which is part of the fused system. So the SMILES might look like c1ccc2ncn3c2c1Sc4ccccc34. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the benzene is connected via a single bond to a bicyclic system. For example, the SMILES could be c1ccc(cc1)-c2ncn3c2Sc4ccccc34. But I need to ensure that all rings are properly closed. Alternatively, the scaffold is a benzene ring fused to another ring system. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The original molecule has the benzene, then connected via N-C(=O)-C to the next ring. Removing the side chains and functional groups, the connecting bond would be between the benzene and the carbon that was part of the C(=O)C group. That carbon is part of the next ring. So in the scaffold, the benzene is connected via a single bond to that carbon, which is part of a fused ring system (the n1... ring with the thiophene). Therefore, the SMILES would be c1ccccc1C2NCN3C2Sc4ccccc43. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the connecting carbon is part of a ring, so the bond is within the ring. Hmm. This is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to reconstruct the scaffold step by step. Remove all substituents: ethyl groups (CC), amide (NC(=O)), carbonyl (=O). The remaining structure would be the benzene ring connected to a ring system. The ring system after the benzene would be the part that's left after removing substituents. So the n1nc...n2c... part becomes n1ncn2c... with the thiophene (sccc3) attached. So the SMILES might be c1ccccc1C2NCN3C2Sc4ccc3c4. Not sure. Alternatively, the correct Murcko scaffold SMILES is c1ccc2ncn3c2c1Sc4ccccc34. Let me validate. The benzene is c1ccc(cc1), connected to a ring system. The next part is ncn3c...Sc4ccccc34. This suggests a fused ring where the benzene is connected to a nitrogen-containing ring fused with a thiophene. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1ccc2c(c1)ncn3c2Sc4ccccc34. That would represent a bicyclic system where the benzene is fused to a ring containing N and S. I think that's closer. But I'm not entirely certain. Given the complexity, I'll go with the SMILES that captures the benzene, the connecting bond to a fused ring system with nitrogen and sulfur atoms, and the thiophene ring. So the final answer would be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc2c(c1)ncn3c2sc4ccccc34\"}.",

The first part has a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to a carbon chain. But wait, the core might be the bicyclic system. Let me parse the SMILES carefully. The part \"c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1\" suggests a fused ring. The nitrogen atoms here indicate a possible five-membered and six-membered ring fused together. \n\nThen there's another ring \"c3ccccn3\" which is a pyridine ring. But according to Murcko's rules, side chains and functional groups are removed. So the substituents like the amide groups (NC(=O)N...) and the methyl groups (C(C)...) should be stripped away. \n\nThe connecting bonds between the rings are important. The main scaffold should retain the fused bicyclic system and any bridges between rings. The benzene ring attached via a single bond might be a side chain. Wait, the \"NC(=O)N\" connects to the bicyclic system. Since that's a functional group, it's removed. Similarly, the pyridine ring attached via an amine (NC(C)) is a side chain. \n\nSo, the remaining scaffold would be the fused bicyclic ring: the part starting with c1cc2[nH]nc...c2cn1. Let me draw this. The core is a benzene ring fused with a five-membered ring containing two nitrogens (from the [nH]nc... parts). After removing the amide and pyridine substituents, the Murcko scaffold is the fused bicyclic system. Converting that back to SMILES would give c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. Wait, checking again. The original structure has c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1. Removing the substituents, the scaffold is c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1.

The connecting bond is between the N in the five-membered ring and the benzene. The substituents like the acetyl group (CC(=O)NCC1...) and the C(C)=NO on the benzene are removed.

If the ring is O1-C-C-N-C(=O)-O1, then the carbonyl is within the ring. But in the original SMILES, it's C(=O)O1, which suggests that the carbonyl is part of the ring. But that's not possible because a ring can't have a carbonyl as part of the ring unless it's a lactam or lactone. Wait, the ring here is O1 attached to C(=O), so the ring structure would be O-C(=O)-N-C-C-O? That would make a five-membered ring with an oxygen, a carbonyl, a nitrogen, and two carbons. But that's possible. So the Murcko scaffold would retain this ring and the benzene connected to the N. So the benzene (c2ccc...cc2) connected via N to the five-membered ring (O1C(=O)NCC1...). Wait, the exact structure: the five-membered ring is O1C-C-N(aromatic)C(=O)O1. So the connecting bond is the N between the two rings. So after removing all substituents, the scaffold is the benzene ring connected via N to the five-membered ring (O1C-C-N-C(=O)-O1). But wait, the connecting bonds are the bonds that link the rings. So the Murcko scaffold should have the two rings (benzene and the five-membered ring) connected by a single bond (the N in the five-membered ring is attached to the benzene). Therefore, the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(N2CCOC(=O)C2)cc1? Wait, no. Let me think again. The five-membered ring in the original molecule is O1C(CNC(=O)C)NC... Hmm, maybe the five-membered ring is O1 connected to a C, which is connected to another C, then N (connected to the benzene), then C(=O), and back to O1. So the ring is O-C-C-N-C(=O)-O. That's a five-membered ring with an oxygen, two carbons, a nitrogen, and a carbonyl. So the SMILES for that ring would be O1C-C-N-C(=O)-O1, but in SMILES notation, that's O1CCN(aromatic)C(=O)O1? Not sure. Alternatively, the ring is written as O1C(CN...)C(=O)O1. Wait, the original SMILES part is C(=O)O1, which is the carbonyl connected to O1, which is part of the ring. So the five-membered ring is O1-C(=O)-N-C-C-O1. Wait, that can't be because the ring would need to have five atoms. Let me count: O, C(=O), N, C, C. That's five atoms. So the ring is O-C(=O)-N-C-C-O. So the SMILES for this ring would be O1C(=O)NCC1. Wait, but the original SMILES has C1CN(...)C(=O)O1. So the ring is O1-C(=O)-C-C-N-C-O1? No, that's six atoms. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's parse the original SMILES step by step. The input is CC(=O)NCC1CN(c2ccc(C(C)=NO)cc2)C(=O)O1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CC(=O)N: Acetamide group.\n- CC1: connected to a ring (1 is the ring closure).\n- Then inside the ring: C-N( attached to the benzene ring )-C(=O)-O1.\n\nSo the ring is O1-C(=O)-C-N-C-C-O1? Wait, no. The SMILES for the ring part is C1CN(...)C(=O)O1. So the ring starts at C1, then C, then N (connected to benzene), then C(=O), then O1. Wait, that's four atoms? C1, C, N, C(=O), O1. That would make a five-membered ring: C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. But how does that form a ring? The ring closure is between C1 and O1. So the sequence is C1 connected to C, which is connected to N, which is connected to C(=O), which is connected to O1, which connects back to C1. That makes a five-membered ring: C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1-C1. But in SMILES notation, the ring closure is indicated by the number. So the ring is C1 (first atom), then the other atoms, then O1 (the fifth atom), closing the ring. So the five-membered ring is C-C-N-C(=O)-O. So the SMILES for the ring would be C1CNC(=O)O1. Wait, but the actual SMILES in the input is C1CN(c2...)C(=O)O1. So the ring is C1 connected to C, then N (with substituent benzene), then C(=O), then O1, closing the ring. So the ring atoms are C1, C, N, C(=O), O1. That's a five-membered ring. Now, the Murcko scaffold requires keeping the rings and connecting bonds. The benzene ring is connected via the N in the five-membered ring. So the two rings are the benzene and the five-membered ring connected by a single bond (N). The substituents on the benzene (C(C)=NO) and the acetamide group (CC(=O)NCC1...) are all side chains and should be removed. So the scaffold is the benzene connected to the five-membered ring via N. The five-membered ring itself is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. But wait, the carbonyl is part of the ring? If so, then in the Murcko scaffold, that stays. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1. Wait, but the five-membered ring in SMILES notation would be O1C(=O)NCC1. Let me construct it properly. The five-membered ring is O1 connected to C(=O), then connected to N, then to C, then to C1 (the starting atom). Wait, perhaps the SMILES for the ring is O1C(=O)NCC1. So the ring is O1-C(=O)-N-C-C1. But that's five atoms. Then the benzene is attached to the N. So the scaffold would be c1ccc(N2C(=O)NCC2)cc1. Wait, no. The original ring is C1CN...C(=O)O1. So the SMILES for the ring part is C1CN(aromatic)C(=O)O1. Wait, maybe I need to re-express the ring. Let me try building it step by step. The five-membered ring starts at C1, then a C connected to N (which is attached to benzene), then C(=O), then O1, which connects back to C1. So the ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. But that's five atoms: C1, C, N, C, O. Wait, the C(=O) is one atom. So the ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. So the SMILES for this ring would be C1CNC(=O)O1. However, in the original molecule, the N is part of the ring and connected to the benzene. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1. Alternatively, perhaps the five-membered ring is O1C(=O)NC(C1). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe using a structure diagram would help, but since I can't draw it, I'll proceed. The key points are: retain the benzene ring and the five-membered ring connected via N. The five-membered ring includes the O and the carbonyl. So the final scaffold should be the benzene connected to the five-membered ring (O, C, N, C, C(=O)) via N. Therefore, the SMILES would be c1ccc(N2CCOC(=O)C2)cc1? Wait, no, because the five-membered ring has the atoms in the order O1, C(=O), N, C, C. So O1-C(=O)-N-C-C-O1. The SMILES for that would be O1C(=O)NCC1. Then the benzene is connected to the N. So combining them: c1ccc(N2C(=O)NCC2)cc1. Wait, but in the original SMILES, the ring is C1CN(...)C(=O)O1. So the ring starts at C1, then C, N, then C(=O)O1. So the ring closure is between C1 and O1. So the ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. So the SMILES is C1CNC(=O)O1. Then attaching the benzene to the N: c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1. Let me check if that makes sense. The benzene (c1ccc...cc1) has an N attached, which is part of the five-membered ring (O1C(=O)NCC1). Wait, maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc(N2CCOC(=O)C2)cc1. No, that's a six-membered ring. Alternatively, the five-membered ring is O1C(=O)NCC1. Then the SMILES would be O1C(=O)NCC1, and attaching that to the benzene's N. So the final scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(N2C(=O)NCC2)cc1. Let me validate this. The benzene ring is c1ccc(N...)cc1. The N is connected to the five-membered ring: C(=O)NCC2. Wait, the ring is O1C(=O)NCC1. So the ring is O1-C(=O)-N-C-C1. That's five atoms. So the SMILES is O1C(=O)NCC1. Then attaching that to the benzene's N: c1ccc(N2C(=O)NCC2)cc1. But in the original molecule, the five-membered ring is C1 connected to C, then N, then C(=O), then O1. So the ring closure is between C1 and O1. Therefore, the SMILES for the five-membered ring is C1CNC(=O)O1. Then attaching the benzene: N is part of the ring, so the SMILES would be c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1. Let me write this out: the benzene is c1ccc(N2...)cc1. The N2 is connected to the ring C1CNC(=O)O1. Wait, the ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. So the SMILES for the ring is C1CNC(=O)O1. Therefore, the full scaffold is c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1. Let me check the connectivity. The benzene's N is connected to the C in the five-membered ring. Wait, no. The N in the five-membered ring is the same N attached to the benzene. So the N is part of both the benzene substituent and the five-membered ring. Therefore, the correct SMILES should have the benzene connected to the N which is in the five-membered ring. So the scaffold is the benzene ring (c1ccc(cc1)N2C-C-N-C(=O)-O2). But in SMILES notation, this would be c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1. Wait, but the ring SMILES is C2CNC(=O)O2. So putting it all together: c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1. However, in the original molecule, the five-membered ring has the sequence C1-C-N(aromatic)-C(=O)-O1. So the ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. Therefore, the SMILES for the ring is O1C(=O)NCC1. Wait, because the ring closure is O1 connected back to C1. So O1-C(=O)-N-C-C1. So the SMILES would be O1C(=O)NCC1. Then attaching the benzene to the N: c1ccc(N2C(=O)NCC2)cc1. Hmm. Now I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Maybe I should use a tool to generate the scaffold, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the best guess. The key is that the Murcko scaffold includes the rings and the connecting bonds. The benzene and the five-membered ring connected via the N. The five-membered ring has the O and the carbonyl. So the correct SMILES is c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is considered an exocyclic group and removed. Wait, the definition says to remove exocyclic modifications. The carbonyl is part of the ring, so it stays. So the final answer should be the benzene connected to the five-membered ring with the carbonyl. Therefore, the correct SMILES is c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1. Let me check this SMILES. The benzene (c1ccc...cc1) has an N connected to a five-membered ring. The five-membered ring is O2 connected to C(=O), then N, then two Cs, closing the ring. Yes, that makes sense. So the final answer is {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc(N2CCNC(=O)O2)cc1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction problem. The input SMILES is NC(=O)c1cncnc1Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1. First, I need to identify the rings and the connecting bonds.\n\nLooking at the structure, there's a central ring connected to another ring via an NH group. The central ring is a six-membered ring with alternating N and C atoms, maybe like a pyrimidine or similar. The other ring is a benzene ring with some substituents.\n\nWait, the SMILES breaks down as NC(=O) connected to a ring (c1cncnc1), then an N linking to another benzene ring (c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1). The Murcko scaffold should retain the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So, the side chains like the amide (NC=O) and the trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) need to be removed.\n\nThe central ring is c1cncnc1, which is a five-membered ring? Wait, c1cncnc1: let's count. Positions 1: C, 2: C, 3: N, 4: C, 5: N, then back to C1. Wait, that's a five-membered ring? Or maybe a six-membered? Wait, the indices might be different. Let me parse it again. The ring closure is c1...c1. The sequence is c1 c n c n c1. So positions 1: C, 2: C, 3: N, 4: C, 5: N, 6: C (since it's c1 at the end). Wait, no, the SMILES notation for the ring is c1 followed by atoms and then closing with c1. So the ring is six-membered: atoms 1 (C), then c, n, c, n, c, and closing back to 1? Wait, no, that would be six atoms. Wait, the part is c1cncnc1. Let's break it down:\n\n- Start with c1 (carbon 1)\n- Then c (carbon 2)\n- n (nitrogen 3)\n- c (carbon 4)\n- n (nitrogen 5)\n- c (carbon 6)\n- Then back to c1 (carbon 1). Wait, no, that's a six-membered ring? But the indices would be 1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, maybe the ring is five-membered? Let me count again. The ring starts at c1, then the next atoms are c, n, c, n, c, then back to c1. That's six atoms? No, because from c1 to the closing c1, there are five atoms in between? Wait, no. The SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to indicate closure. So c1 starts the ring, then each subsequent atom is part of the ring until another atom with the same number. So in c1cncnc1, the atoms are:\n\n1: c (position 1)\n2: c (connected to 1)\n3: n (connected to 2)\n4: c (connected to 3)\n5: n (connected to 4)\n6: c (connected to 5 and back to 1). So that's a six-membered ring: positions 1-2-3-4-5-6-1. So it's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. That's a diazine maybe? Wait, but the structure would be C-C-N-C-N-C, forming a six-membered ring with two nitrogens at positions 3 and 5.\n\nThen, this ring is connected via an NH group (N in the middle) to another benzene ring. The benzene ring has a substituent C(F)(F)F, which is a trifluoromethyl group. So the benzene ring is c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1. The Murcko scaffold should remove the trifluoromethyl group, leaving just the benzene ring.\n\nSo the connecting bonds are the NH between the two rings. But wait, the definition says to leave the ring systems and connecting bonds. The NH is part of the connecting bond. So the scaffold would be the two rings connected by the single bond (the N). But do we keep the NH as part of the connecting bridge?\n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold typically retains the ring systems and the linkers between them. So any atoms that are part of the bridge connecting the rings are kept. So in this case, the N that connects the two rings is part of the linker. Let me visualize the structure.\n\nOriginal molecule: The central six-membered ring (c1cncnc1) has an amide group (NC=O) attached. Then, there's an NH (from the N in the central ring) connecting to a benzene ring. The benzene ring has a CF3 group attached.\n\nSo the Murcko scaffold would remove the amide (NC=O) and the CF3 group. The central ring becomes just the six-membered ring with two nitrogens. The benzene ring is just the benzene. The connecting part is the NH between them. Wait, but the NH is part of the linker. So the scaffold should include the two rings connected by the NH group. So the scaffold would be the central ring (without the amide), connected via NH to the benzene ring (without the CF3).\n\nSo the SMILES would be c1cncnc1Nc2ccccc2. Wait, let's check. The central ring is c1cncnc1 (but maybe the order is different when written without substituents). The benzene ring is c2ccccc2. The NH is the N connecting them: Nc2ccccc2.\n\nPutting it together: c1cncnc1Nc2ccccc2. Let me verify. The original SMILES after removing the substituents would have the central ring (c1cncnc1) connected via N to the benzene (Nc2ccccc2). So the scaffold SMILES should be c1cncnc1Nc2ccccc2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. The amide group (NC(=O)) and the CF3 are side chains, so they're removed. The NH is part of the connecting bond between the two rings, so it's retained. So the final SMILES is the two rings connected by the NH linker.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc(OCCNC3CCCCC3)cc(O)c12. First, I need to identify all the ring systems. The main structure has two rings connected by an oxygen. The first part is a quinone-like ring with a ketone (O=C1...). There's a substituent -c2ccccc2 attached, which is a benzene ring. Then there's another oxygen connecting to a second ring, which has some oxygen-containing groups and an OCCNC3CCCCC3 side chain.\n\nFollowing the Murcko definition, I have to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. The benzene ring (-c2ccccc2) is a substituent, so that gets removed. The OCCNC3CCCCC3 is a side chain with an ethyl group attached to a piperidine (or similar) ring; that whole part should be stripped. The oxygens that are part of the rings (like the ketone and the ether) stay, but any hydroxyl (OH) groups attached exocyclically would go. Wait, looking at the SMILES, there's a 'cc(O)c12' at the end\u2014so an OH attached to the ring? That's exocyclic and needs removal. The connecting bonds between rings are kept. So the remaining scaffold would be the two fused rings (the quinone and the adjacent ring connected via oxygen) without any substituents. Let me draw it out mentally: the main structure is a bicyclic system with rings connected by an oxygen bridge. After removing all substituents and side chains, the scaffold should be O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. Wait, but need to check the connectivity. Original SMILES: the core is probably a tricyclic system? Let me parse again. The first part is O=C1C=C(-c2ccccc2)Oc2cc(...)C(=O)C1. Maybe the main rings are the two fused with the ketone groups. After removing substituents, the scaffold would be the fused rings with the ketone and the oxygen bridge. So the final SMILES would be O=c1ccc2oc3cc(O)cc(O)c3c2c1. Wait, no. Let me better break it down. The original molecule has a central ring connected via oxygen to another ring. The substituents are the benzene and the OCCNC3... part. Removing those, the core would be the rings connected by the oxygen, keeping the ketone groups if they are part of the rings. The quinone structure would remain. So the Murcko scaffold is O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, the main rings are the two benzene-like rings connected by the oxygen. Let me verify. The original SMILES: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc(OCCNC3CCCCC3)cc(O)c12. The central part is c1cc...oc2...c12, indicating two rings connected via an oxygen. The substituents are the -c2ccccc2 (benzene) and the OCC... part. Removing those, the scaffold would be O=C1C=Coc2ccccc21. Wait, but the exact connectivity matters. Let me write it correctly. The main rings are the ones formed by the atoms in the SMILES notation. The first ring is o1c(=O)cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2... So the main rings are the two connected by the oxygen, with the ketone (O=C) as part of the first ring. After removing substituents, the scaffold would be O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. But perhaps the rings are fused? Let me check the numbering. The SMILES notation is O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc(...)cc(O)c12. The 'c12' at the end indicates that atom 1 is connected to atom 2 of the second ring. So the first ring is a 5-membered ring (O=C1-C-C-O-C2), and the second ring is a 6-membered ring (C2-C-C-C-C-C2). Wait, maybe it's a fused system. Alternatively, the first ring is O=C1C=C(-...)OC2..., forming a five-membered ring (O=C1-C-C-O-C2...), and then the C2 is part of another ring. This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the main scaffold consists of two fused rings: one with the ketone and oxygen, forming a bicyclic system. Once all substituents are removed, the remaining structure is the fused rings with the oxygen bridge and the ketone. So the correct SMILES would be O=C1C=C2Oc3ccccc3C1=O. Wait, but the original has two oxygen atoms. Let me reconstruct. The original SMILES has O=c1cc...oc2...c12. So the first ring is a 5-membered ring: O=C1-C-C-O-C connected to C2, which is part of a benzene ring. Removing substituents, the scaffold would be O=C1CCOC2=CC=CC=C12. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the scaffold is O=C1C=C2Oc3ccccc3C1=O. That forms a fused bicyclic system with two ketone groups. I think that's the correct Murcko scaffold here.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction problem. The input SMILES is O=C(O)Cc1ccc2c(c1)C(O)(C(F)(F)F)c1ccccc1-2.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the molecule. The SMILES starts with a carboxylic acid group (O=C(O)), attached to a CH2 group (Cc1...). Then there's a benzene ring (ccc2c(c1)...) connected to another part. The next part is a bit complex: C(O)(C(F)(F)F) which is a carbon attached to an hydroxyl group (-OH) and a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3). Then there's another benzene ring (ccccc1) connected via a bond labeled as -2.\n\nThe Murcko scaffold requires retaining only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So, I should remove all the side chains and functional groups. The carboxylic acid (O=C(O)) on the CH2 is a side chain, so that gets removed. The hydroxyl (-OH) and trifluoromethyl (-CF3) groups attached to the central carbon (C) are also side chains and should be stripped off. The fluorine atoms in the trifluoromethyl group are definitely exocyclic, so those go too.\n\nLooking at the rings: there's the first benzene ring (c1ccc2...) and another benzene ring (c1ccccc1) connected via the central carbon. Wait, the central carbon (C) is part of a bridge between the two rings? The structure might be a bicyclic system. The original molecule has two benzene rings connected by a bridge that includes the central carbon with substituents. But for the Murcko scaffold, we need to keep the rings and the bridge without the substituents.\n\nSo, after removing the side chains (carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, trifluoromethyl), what remains is the two benzene rings connected by the bridge. The bridge here is the central carbon that was originally attached to those groups. But wait, in the scaffold, the bridge is part of the ring system. Let me check the connectivity again. The original SMILES is O=C(O)Cc1ccc2c(c1)C(O)(C(F)(F)F)c1ccccc1-2. Breaking it down:\n\n- The first ring is c1ccc2... which is part of a fused ring system? The '2' indicates a connection point. The central carbon (C) is connected to ring1 (c1), then to the second ring (c1ccccc1) via the bond labeled '2'. So the two rings are connected through the central carbon, forming a bridged structure. However, the central carbon has substituents (OH and CF3), which are removed. But the scaffold should retain the bridged ring structure without those substituents.\n\nWait, removing substituents on the bridge would leave the bridge as a single bond? Or is the bridge part of the ring system? Maybe the scaffold has the two benzene rings connected by a single bond, but I need to ensure that the rings and the connecting bonds are preserved. Alternatively, if the bridge is part of a fused ring system, then it's part of the scaffold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original structure is a bicyclic system where the central carbon is part of the bridge. If the substituents on that bridge are removed, then the bridge remains as part of the ring system. For example, if the bridge is a single atom (like the central C), and we remove its substituents, then the bridge is just a single atom connecting the two rings. That would be part of the Murcko scaffold.\n\nSo, the process is: identify all rings and the connecting bonds. Remove all side chains and functional groups attached outside the rings and bridges. The carboxylic acid group is a side chain on the CH2, which is not part of any ring, so that entire chain (O=C(O)C) is removed. The hydroxyl and trifluoromethyl groups on the central C are substituents, so they are removed, leaving the central C as part of the bridge connecting the two benzene rings. The two benzene rings and the bridge C form the scaffold.\n\nTherefore, the Murcko scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected via the central carbon atom (without any substituents). The resulting SMILES would be c1ccc2c(c1)Cc3ccccc32. Let me verify. The original structure after removing substituents would have the two benzene rings (c1ccc2 and c3ccccc3) connected via the central C. The bridge would form a spiro structure or a fused ring? Wait, in the original SMILES, the central C is connected to ring1 (atom c1) and to ring2 (atom c1 in the second ring), with the bond notation -2. Maybe the correct scaffold is a fused bicyclic system where the two benzene rings share a common bridge (the central C). So, the scaffold would be c1ccc2c(c1)Cc1ccccc12. Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, the correct SMILES is c1ccc2c(c1)Cc3ccccc23, which connects the two rings through the central C. Let me draw it mentally: benzene ring 1 (c1ccc2...), then the central C attached to position 2 of ring 1, and then attached to benzene ring 2 (c3ccccc3) via position 2. So the SMILES would be c1ccc2c(c1)Cc3ccccc23, which would form a bridged bicyclic structure. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is c1ccc2c(c1)C(c3ccccc3)c2, but I need to make sure the connectivity is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the scaffold is the two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Wait, in the original structure, the central C is connected to both rings. If we remove the substituents (OH and CF3), the central C becomes a bridge between the two benzene rings. So the scaffold would have the two benzene rings connected by a single carbon bridge. That would be a bicyclo structure. The SMILES for that would be c1ccc2c(c1)Cc1ccccc12. Let me check: the first benzene is c1ccc2, the central C is part of ring2, then the second benzene is connected via the central C. Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1ccc2c(c1)Cc3ccccc3-2. Because in the original SMILES, the bond between the central C and the second ring is labeled as -2. So after removing substituents, the bond remains. Therefore, the scaffold would be c1ccc2c(c1)Cc3ccccc3-2. But in SMILES notation, the closure numbers need to be handled properly. Alternatively, the correct scaffold is c1ccc2c(c1)Cc1ccccc12, which correctly closes the rings. Testing this in a SMILES parser would help, but since I can't do that here, I'll proceed with the assumption that the two benzene rings are connected via the central carbon, forming a bridged structure. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold SMILES should be c1ccc2c(c1)Cc3ccccc23.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is Cn1c(=O)c(Oc2ccc(F)cc2F)cc2cnc(N3CCCC(O)C3)nc21.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the rings. The molecule has a central ring system. The main ring is likely the one with the n1...c21 atoms. Let me parse the SMILES: the core seems to be a bicyclic system with two fused rings. The first ring is a five-membered ring with an oxygen (from the =O), and the second is a six-membered ring connected via the cc2 part.\n\nNow, removing side chains. The molecule has several substituents: a methyl group (C) attached to the nitrogen (n1), an oxygen-linked aromatic ring (Oc2ccc(F)cc2F), and a piperazine-like ring (N3CCCC(O)C3). All these are side chains or exocyclic groups. The Murcko scaffold should retain only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So, I need to strip away the methyl (C), the O-linked fluorinated benzene, and the piperazine ring with the hydroxyl group.\n\nThe connecting bonds between the rings are part of the scaffold. The central structure after removal would be the fused bicyclic system without any substituents. Let me visualize: the core is the fused rings, so the scaffold SMILES would be c1ncc2cnc1c2. Wait, maybe checking the connectivity again. Original SMILES: n1 is part of the first ring (c(=O)c...), but after removing substituents, the oxygen from =O is a functional group, so that carbonyl (O) would be removed. Similarly, the O in the O-linked benzene is part of the side chain. So the core rings are the ones without those substituents. Let me reconstruct the SMILES without the side chains. The main rings would be the nitrogen-containing rings. Removing all substituents except the rings and the bonds between them. The correct scaffold would be the fused bicyclic system without any substituents: c1c2cnc3nc1c23. Hmm, maybe I should write it as c1cc2c(n1)cnc2. Wait, perhaps using the original numbering. Alternatively, the scaffold could be n1c2cc3cncn3c2c1. Not sure. Let me count the atoms. The original core is a bicyclic system: positions 1 (N), 2 (C=O), then connected to another ring. Removing the substituents, the rings are fused with the connecting bonds. The correct Murcko scaffold would be c1c(=O)ncc2cnc(N)nc21, but wait, no, because the =O and N3 are part of side chains. Wait, the carbonyl (O) is an exocyclic double bond, but according to the definition, exocyclic modifications are removed. So the =O is a functional group and should be removed. Similarly, the amide N's substituents (like the methyl) are side chains. So the main rings would be the skeleton without those. Let me rebuild the SMILES: the core is the bicyclic system with N and C atoms, without any substituents. So starting with n1c... The original structure has a five-membered ring and a six-membered ring. The five-membered ring is n1c(cc2...) etc. After removing all side chains, the scaffold should be n1ccc2cncnc12. Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cnc2nccc2c1. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2. Not sure. Maybe using a tool would help, but since I have to do it manually, perhaps the correct structure is the fused bicyclic rings with N atoms. The original SMILES after removing substituents would be n1c2cc3cnc(N)nc3c2c1. But the N in the piperazine is a substituent, so removing that, the core is n1c2cc3cncnc3c2c1. So the SMILES would be c1c2cc3cncnc3c2n1. Wait, perhaps I need to remove the oxygen and all substituents. Let me try again. The original core rings are the two fused rings: the first ring is n1 connected to c(=O), but the =O is removed. So n1c(c(cc2...)) etc. Removing all substituents (methyl, O-linked benzene, and the piperazine), the scaffold would be the fused bicyclic system: the five-membered ring (n1, c, c, c, c) fused to a six-membered ring (c, c, c, c, n, c). The connecting bonds are the shared atoms. So the SMILES would be n1ccc2cncnc12. Let me check the connectivity. Yes, that makes a fused bicyclic system. So the Murcko scaffold is n1ccc2cncnc12, which in SMILES is C1=NC2=CC=CN=C2N1. Wait, but in the original input, the rings are connected via a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2. But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the correct answer is the scaffold without any substituents, so the SMILES would be c1c2c(nc3nc1c23)CC. No, that's not right. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2, which would be a fused bicyclic system with two rings. Alternatively, considering the original structure, after removing all substituents, the core is a bicyclic system with two nitrogens. The correct SMILES would be c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2. Let me write that as C1=CN=C2C=CC=CN12. Wait, but in the original input, there are two fluorine atoms and oxygen atoms, but those are all in substituents. So the final scaffold should be the fused rings without any substituents. Therefore, the correct SMILES is c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2, which in canonical form might be C1=CN=C2C=CC=CN12. Wait, but I need to write it correctly. Alternatively, the correct SMILES is c1ccc2cncnc12. Let me try to count the atoms. For a fused bicyclic system, perhaps the correct structure is n1c2ccccc2cnc1. No, that's a different arrangement. Alternatively, the correct answer is c1c2cnc3nc1c(c2)n3. Hmm. I think I need to step back. The original molecule has a central bicyclic system where the rings are connected. The substituents are the methyl, the O-linked fluorobenzene, and the piperazine. Removing all those, the scaffold is the two fused rings. The SMILES for the scaffold would be the rings connected without substituents. Let me try to write it as n1c2cc3cncnc3c2c1. So in SMILES format: c1c2cc3cncnc3c2n1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer might be c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2. To resolve this, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2, which would correspond to a fused bicyclic system with two nitrogens. Therefore, the Output Scaffold should be \"c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2\". But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is \"c1ccc2cnc(n1)c2\". Another approach: look at the original SMILES and remove substituents. The original is Cn1c(=O)c(Oc2ccc(F)cc2F)cc2cnc(N3CCCC(O)C3)nc21. Removing substituents: the methyl (C) attached to n1 becomes a hydrogen, so n1 becomes [nH]1. The c(=O) becomes c (since O is removed). The O-linked benzene (Oc2ccc(F)cc2F) is removed, so the c(O...) becomes c. The cc2cnc(N3...) becomes cc2cnc(nc21). But the N3 substituent is part of the side chain, so removing that, the nc becomes n. So the scaffold would be n1c(c2cnc(nc21))... Hmm, perhaps after removing all substituents, the core is n1c(cc2cncnc21). So the SMILES would be n1ccc2cncnc12. When canonicalized, that would be C1=NC2=CN=CN=C2N1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct answer is \"c1ccc2cnc(n1)c2\". But without the correct tool, it's hard. I think the correct Murcko scaffold is the fused bicyclic system with two nitrogens, so the SMILES is c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2, which in canonical form would be C1=CN=C2C=CC=CN12. But maybe the correct answer is \"c1cnc2c(n1)ccc2\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction problem. The input SMILES is CC(NC(=O)Nc1cc2[nH]nc(S(C)(=O)=O)c2cn1)c1ccccc1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the rings. Looking at the structure, there's a central ring connected to another ring. Let's break it down. The main part seems to be the bicyclic system: one benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached via a carbon to another ring. The other ring is a fused system with a nitrogen atom. The SMILES string has 'c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1', which suggests a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. Then there's the S(C)(=O)=O group, which is a sulfonyl group attached. \n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold requires removing side chains and exocyclic groups. So, the sulfonyl group (S(C)(=O)=O) is a functional group and should be removed. The amide groups (NC(=O)N...) are also side chains. The methyl groups (like the C attached to the benzene) are side chains too. \n\nSo, stripping all that, the rings left would be the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) connected via a single bond to the fused ring. The fused ring is the part from 'c1cc2[nH]nc...c2cn1'\u2014but removing the [nH] and the sulfonyl part. Let me reconstruct that. The core rings would be the benzene and the other ring which is a pyridine-like ring fused with another ring. Wait, the 'c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1' part: the 'nH' is part of the ring? So the ring has a nitrogen with a hydrogen, but since it's part of the ring system, maybe it stays. Wait, no\u2014the Murcko scaffold keeps the ring systems and connecting bonds. So the exocyclic groups are the substituents. The sulfonyl is attached to the ring via the sulfur, so that's a side chain. The amide (NC(=O)N) is a side chain too. The methyl group (CC(...)) is another substituent.\n\nSo after removing all side chains, the core would be the two connected rings. The benzene ring (c1ccccc1) connected to the other ring system. The other ring system is a bicyclic structure: let's see, the part 'c1cc2[nH]nc...c2cn1'\u2014when you remove the sulfonyl and the amide, you're left with the rings. Let's parse that. The main ring is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens: positions where the [nH] and the other nitrogen are. But maybe it's a five-membered ring fused to a six-membered? Hmm, perhaps I should draw this mentally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the core is the benzene ring connected via a single bond to a bicyclic system. The bicyclic system would be the two fused rings: one with the two nitrogens. The connecting bonds between the rings are kept. So, the final Murcko scaffold would be the benzene ring connected to the fused ring system without any substituents. Let me check the SMILES again. The original is CC(...)c1ccccc1, so the benzene is attached to a carbon which has another substituent (the amide group), but that's a side chain. So removing that, the benzene is connected via a single bond to the other ring system. The other ring system, after removing the sulfonyl and the amide groups, would be the fused rings with nitrogens. So the core scaffold would be c1ccccc1 connected to the fused bicyclic ring. The fused rings would be c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1, but without the substituents. Wait, the 'nH' is part of the ring, so that stays. The sulfonyl (S(C)(=O)=O) is a substituent on the ring, so that gets removed. The amide group (NC(=O)N) is a substituent on the nitrogen, so that's removed. So the core rings are the benzene and the fused bicyclic ring where the sulfonyl and amide groups are stripped. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1-c2cc3[nH]nc3cn2. Wait, but how are the rings connected? Let me re-express the SMILES properly. The original part after the benzene is Nc1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1. Removing the substituents, the core would be the c1cc2[nH]nc3c2cn1. Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1ccc(-c2cc3nc([nH]c3cn2)cc1. Hmm, maybe I should simplify. The main rings are benzene (c1ccccc1) and a bicyclic ring system. The bicyclic part is a five-membered and six-membered ring fused together. The exact SMILES would require proper arrangement. Alternatively, maybe the correct Murcko scaffold is c1ccccc1C2CC3=NCCN3C2. No, that's not right. Let me try again. The original SMILES has Nc1cc2[nH]nc(S(C)(=O)=O)c2cn1. Stripping substituents, the ring would be c1cc2[nH]nc...c2cn1. Without the substituents, it's c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. But the connecting bond between the benzene and the bicyclic ring is via the N in NC(=O)... which is a substituent. Wait, the original SMILES is CC(...)c1ccccc1. So the benzene is attached to a carbon that's part of another chain. Wait, maybe the benzene is a substituent on the central carbon, which is connected to the other ring. So the central carbon is part of the connecting chain between the two rings? No, the Murcko scaffold removes all side chains. So the connecting bonds are those that are part of the ring systems. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the central carbon (the C in CC(...)) is part of a chain connecting the two rings. But according to the definition, the Murcko scaffold includes the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So any chains connecting the rings are kept only if they are part of the framework. So, the central carbon here might be part of a connecting chain. Let's see: the original structure has a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to a central carbon (the first C in CC(...)), which is connected to a nitrogen (NC(=O)...), which is connected to another carbon (the NC(=O)Nc...), which connects to the bicyclic ring. So the connecting path between the benzene and the bicyclic ring is through a chain: C-N-C-N-c... So those are all connecting bonds? Or are they considered side chains? Wait, the Murcko scaffold is supposed to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. So the rings are kept, and the connecting bonds between rings are kept, but any side chains (like substituents on the rings or on the connecting bonds) are removed. So in this case, the benzene ring is connected via a chain (C-N-C-N-) to the other ring. That chain would be considered a connecting bridge between the rings and thus part of the scaffold? Or is that chain a side chain? Hmm. According to the definition, the Murcko scaffold includes the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So the connecting bonds are the ones that are necessary to link the rings. If the rings are connected via a chain, then that chain is part of the scaffold. For example, in a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2-benzene, the Murcko scaffold would be benzene connected by a two-carbon chain. But wait, maybe the connecting bonds are only those that are part of the ring systems. No, the connecting bonds can include aliphatic chains that connect the rings. For example, in the case of a drug like imatinib, the Murcko scaffold includes the central benzene connected via a piperazine ring through a methyl group and an amide linker. Wait, no\u2014Murcko scaffold typically removes all side chains, so any single bonds that are not part of the rings are considered connecting bonds only if they are directly between rings. I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let me look for an example. For instance, the molecule with SMILES C1CCN(CC1)C2CCCCC2 would have a Murcko scaffold of C1CCN(CC1)C2CCCCC2, keeping the two rings connected by the N. But if there's a substituent on the N, like C1CCN(CC1)C(C)C2CCCCC2, then the scaffold would still be the two rings connected by the N. The substituents on the N would be removed. Wait, but in that case, the N is part of the connecting structure. So, perhaps in the given problem, the connecting chain between the benzene and the bicyclic ring is through a nitrogen, which is part of the scaffold. But in the original SMILES, the benzene is attached to a carbon (the first C in CC(...)), which is connected to a nitrogen (NC(=O)...), which is connected to another carbon (C=O), which is connected to another nitrogen (Nc...), which connects to the bicyclic ring. So the chain is C-N-C(=O)-N-... So those are all part of the connecting chain. But according to the Murcko definition, all side chains and functional groups are removed. So the connecting bonds between rings are kept, but any substituents on those connecting bonds are removed. Wait, but in this case, the chain itself (C-N-C(=O)-N-) is connecting the benzene to the bicyclic ring. However, the Murcko scaffold would simplify this to the shortest path connecting the rings. For example, if the rings are connected by a chain, the scaffold would retain that chain. But in this case, the chain includes an amide group (NC(=O)N), which is a functional group and should be removed. So perhaps the actual connecting bond is just a single bond between the benzene and the bicyclic ring, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, the benzene and the bicyclic ring are connected via a single bond through a nitrogen. Wait, maybe the actual Murcko scaffold is the bicyclic ring system (the part with the two fused rings) connected via a single bond to the benzene ring. Let me try to reconstruct the SMILES. The original has the benzene attached to a carbon, which is part of a chain leading to the bicyclic ring. But according to the definition, all side chains are removed. So the benzene is a side chain if it's attached via a single bond to a non-ring atom. Wait, the benzene is attached to a carbon (the first C in CC(...)), which is connected to a nitrogen. That carbon is a bridge between the benzene and the rest. Since that carbon is not part of any ring, the benzene is considered a side chain and is removed? No, wait\u2014if the benzene is part of the ring system, but in this case, the benzene is a separate ring connected via a chain. So the Murcko scaffold would retain only the bicyclic ring system. Wait, but that can't be right. The definition says the scaffold includes all ring systems and connecting bonds. So if there are multiple rings connected by bonds (even single bonds), they are part of the scaffold. But any substituents on those rings are removed. So, in this case, the benzene ring is connected via a single bond to a carbon, which is connected to a nitrogen, etc. But the carbon is not part of any ring. So that entire chain (C-N-C(=O)-N-) is a side chain from the benzene's perspective. Therefore, the benzene would be a side chain and removed. But then the main ring system is the bicyclic ring. Alternatively, perhaps the main scaffold includes both the benzene and the bicyclic ring connected via the shortest path. But I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The Murcko scaffold is obtained by iteratively removing all acyclic atoms (those not in rings) except for those that connect rings. So any atom that's part of a ring or in a chain connecting two rings is kept; others are removed. So, in the input SMILES, the benzene ring is connected via a carbon (which is not part of any ring) to a nitrogen, which is part of an amide group connected to the bicyclic ring. That carbon and the subsequent nitrogen and carbonyl are acyclic and not part of any connecting chain between rings. Therefore, those atoms are removed, and the benzene ring is a side chain. Thus, the Murcko scaffold would only include the bicyclic ring system. But wait, the bicyclic ring system is connected via the nitrogen to the amide group, which is a side chain. So removing that, the bicyclic ring's core would be the fused rings without substituents. But the original bicyclic ring has a sulfur substituent (from the sulfonyl group), which is a side chain. So stripping all that, the core is the fused rings with nitrogens. Let me look at the bicyclic part: c1cc2[nH]nc(S(C)(=O)=O)c2cn1. Removing the sulfonyl group (S(C)...), we're left with c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. But the [nH] is part of the ring, so it stays. So the SMILES for the bicyclic ring is c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. Is that a valid SMILES? Let me parse it. The ring closure is c1...c2...c2...n1. The first ring (c1) starts with c1, then cc2, then [nH]nc... So the bicyclic system is a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. The six-membered ring has two nitrogens: one at position 3 (nH) and one at position 5 (n). The five-membered ring is formed by the c2...c2 closure. Hmm, perhaps the correct SMILES is n1c2cc[nH]c2cn1. No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fused rings would be represented as c1c2ncnc-2cc1. Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cnc2[nH]ccc12. Let me try to draw this mentally. Starting at position 1 (c1), then c (position 2), then n (position 3), c (position 4), then n (position 5), etc. Maybe it's a pyrimidine ring fused to another ring. This is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct Murcko scaffold SMILES is c1cc2[nH]nccc2cn1. Testing this, it would form a six-membered ring with two nitrogens and a fused five-membered ring. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the main scaffold after removing substituents would be the benzene ring connected to the bicyclic ring via a single bond. But earlier analysis suggested that the connecting chain is considered a side chain. Maybe the correct answer is just the bicyclic ring without the benzene. But the original molecule has two separate rings connected via a chain. According to the Murcko definition, only the ring systems and connecting bonds are kept. If the connecting bonds are part of the scaffold, then both rings would be kept. But in this case, the connection is through a chain that's not part of a ring, so perhaps it's considered a side chain. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would be the larger ring system. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is the fused bicyclic ring system. Let me look for examples. For instance, if a molecule has a benzene ring connected via a methyl group to another ring, the Murcko scaffold would include both rings connected by the methyl group. But in this case, the connection is via a longer chain with functional groups, which are removed. So, perhaps the scaffold is the fused bicyclic ring only. Alternatively, the benzene is connected via a single bond that's part of the scaffold. But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the assumption that the Murcko scaffold is the fused bicyclic ring system plus the benzene connected via a single bond. But I need to ensure all substituents are stripped. The benzene is attached to a carbon which is connected to a nitrogen (side chain), so that entire chain is a side chain from the benzene. Therefore, the benzene is a side chain and removed. The main scaffold is the fused bicyclic ring. The fused bicyclic ring's SMILES would be c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. Let me check if that's valid. Starting at the first carbon (c1), then c, c2, [nH], n, c, c2, c, n1. This forms two fused rings: a six-membered and a five-membered. The six-membered ring has atoms c1, c, c2, [nH], n, c, and back to c1. The five-membered ring is c2, [nH], n, c, c2. Wait, that might not close properly. Alternatively, the SMILES might be c1cnc2[nH]ccc12. Let me try numbering: c1 connects to c, then n, then c2. Then [nH], c, c, c2, back to n, then c1. That forms a six-membered ring (c1-c-n-c2-c-c) and a five-membered ring (c2-n-[nH]-c-c2). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cc2[nH]nc(N)cc2cn1, but without the substituents. But in this case, the substituents are removed, leaving c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. This should represent a fused bicyclic system. I think that's the core scaffold here. So the final answer should be that SMILES.",

There's also a nitrooxy group (ONO) at the end.\n\nAccording to the definition, I need to remove all side chains and functional groups. The aliphatic chain (CCCCCCC) is a side chain, so that gets removed. The nitrooxy (O=C(...)NO) is a functional group and should be stripped off. The connecting bond between the benzene and the carbonyl group via the N is part of the scaffold. Wait, the N is part of an amide group here: Nc1ccccc1 is attached to the carbonyl. The amide might be considered a functional group, so maybe that N is part of the side chain. Hmm, but Murcko scaffolds retain the ring systems and the connecting bonds between them. If the benzene is connected via a single bond to the N, which is part of the amide, then perhaps the connecting bond is the one between the N and the carbonyl. But in the original structure, the chain is CCCC connected to the carbonyl, which is connected to the amide N. So the rings here are only the benzene. The rest are side chains. So removing all except the benzene ring. Wait, but sometimes connecting atoms are kept. For example, if there's a bridge between rings, but here there's only one ring. So the Murcko scaffold should just be the benzene ring. But wait, maybe the connecting bonds are the ones that link rings. Since there's only one ring, the scaffold is the benzene. Let me check examples. For instance, if you have something like diphenamide, the scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by the amide. Wait, but maybe not. The exact method is to remove all side chains and leave the ring systems with the connecting bonds. So in this case, the benzene is a single ring. The connecting bonds would be any bonds that connect rings, but here there's only one ring. So the scaffold is benzene. But wait, the original structure has the benzene connected via N to the chain. Since the chain is a side chain, it's removed. Therefore, the scaffold is c1ccccc1. But maybe the connecting atoms (like the N) are considered part of the scaffold if they are part of the ring.

The input SMILES is Cc1cc(C(N)=O)ccc1-n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1-c1ccc(-c2cnn(C)c2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the ring systems. Looking at the SMILES, there are three aromatic rings. The first part is \"c1cc...ccc1\" which is a benzene ring. Then there's \"n1c...ccc1\" which is a pyridine-like ring. The third part is another benzene ring \"c1ccc...cc1\".\n\nNext, connecting bonds. The original structure has the first benzene connected via a single bond to the pyridine ring (the \"-\" after the first benzene). The pyridine is then connected to the third benzene with another single bond. Also, the third benzene has a substituent \"-c2cnn(C)c2\", which is another ring (a triazole maybe?).\n\nNow, removing side chains and exocyclic groups. The first benzene has a methyl group (C) and a C(N)=O group. Those are side chains, so remove them. The pyridine ring has a CCC(=O)O group; that's a side chain, remove it. The third benzene has a substituent connected to the triazole ring. Wait, the triazole (c2cnn(C)c2) is a separate ring. But since it's attached via a single bond, it's considered a side chain. So we remove that too. The connecting bonds between the three main rings are kept.\n\nSo the Murcko scaffold should consist of the three aromatic rings connected by their original bonds. The first benzene, then pyridine, then benzene, all connected without any substituents. Let me check the connecting bonds again. The first ring is connected to the pyridine with a single bond, and the pyridine to the third benzene with a single bond. Those connecting bonds are retained.\n\nPutting it all together, the scaffold would be the benzene ring linked to pyridine, linked to another benzene. The SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccc(-c2cnnc2)cc1? Wait, maybe I need to adjust the numbering. Alternatively, maybe it's c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1cccc(-c2cnnc2)c1. Wait, original SMILES after removing substituents: the first ring is c1ccccc1 connected via - to n1cccc1, then connected via - to another benzene. But the exact arrangement depends on the positions. Let me parse the original again.\n\nOriginal SMILES breakdown: The first part is Cc1cc(C(N)=O)ccc1- which is a benzene with substituents. Removing substituents gives c1ccccc1. Then connected to n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1- which after removing CCC(=O)O becomes n1cccc1. Then connected to c1ccc(-c2cnn(C)c2)cc1. Removing the -c2cnn(C)c2 gives c1ccccc1. So the scaffold should be the three rings connected by single bonds. Wait, but the middle ring is a pyridine (n1cccc1), connected to two benzene rings. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1cccc(-c3ccccc3)c1. Hmm, maybe better to represent as c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c3cccc(-c4ccccc4)c3. But need to ensure correct connectivity. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is the three rings connected as [benzene]-[pyridine]-[benzene], so the SMILES is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1cccc(-c2ccccc2)c1. However, I need to check if the original connections are between specific atoms. In the input, the first benzene is connected to the pyridine via the first benzene's position (the hyphen after the first benzene's closure). Similarly, the pyridine is connected to the third benzene. So the exact positions matter. Maybe the correct Murcko scaffold is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1cccc(-c2ccccc2)c1. But to avoid confusion, perhaps using numbers to denote the ring connections. Alternatively, the correct SMILES might be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c1cccc(c2ccccc2)c1. Wait, but the original has \"-n1c...\" so the connection is via the nitrogen ring. Let me re-express the original without substituents: the first ring is c1ccccc1 connected to the pyridine n1cccc1 via a single bond. Then the pyridine is connected to the third benzene c1ccccc1. So the scaffold would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccc(-c4ccccc4)cc3. But perhaps the positions might need adjustment. Alternatively, the correct scaffold is the combination of the three rings connected via their single bonds, resulting in a structure like c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1. However, I need to make sure that the connecting bonds are correctly placed. In the original, after removing substituents, the central pyridine is connected to two benzene rings. So the Murcko scaffold SMILES should be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1. But wait, the third benzene in the original is connected via a single bond from the pyridine. Let me reconstruct step by step: original is [benzene with substituents]-[pyridine with substituents]-[benzene with substituents]. After removing substituents, it's [benzene]-[pyridine]-[benzene]. The connecting bonds are between the benzene and pyridine, and pyridine and benzene. So the SMILES should be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1. But when I write this, the SMILES might have two benzene rings connected via a single bond to the pyridine. However, the actual connectivity in the original is benzene connected to pyridine, which is connected to another benzene. So the scaffold would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccc(-c4ccccc4)cc3. But SMILES notation might collapse this into a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1cccc(-c2ccccc2)c1. Let me check with a SMILES parser if possible. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. No, because the third part is another benzene connected via a single bond. So it's three rings connected in a chain. Wait, but maybe the middle ring is the pyridine, connected to two benzenes. So the correct structure is benzene-pyridine-benzene, connected via single bonds. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. But I need to ensure the correct positions. The original SMILES for the central part is -n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1-, so the pyridine has the substituent (which is removed) on the nitrogen. The connecting points are the nitrogen's adjacent carbons. So after removing substituents, the pyridine ring is n1cccc1, connected to the first benzene at one position and the third benzene at another. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact arrangement. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1cccc(-c2ccccc2)c1. However, considering the original SMILES structure, the third benzene is connected via a single bond to the pyridine. So the scaffold should have two benzene rings connected to the pyridine. The final SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. But this might not capture the correct connectivity. Alternatively, using RDKit to process this would help, but since I can't do that, I have to rely on SMILES syntax. Another approach: the original molecule has three rings connected in a chain. The first benzene is connected to the pyridine, which is connected to the third benzene. So the scaffold is benzene-pyridine-benzene. The SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. But the third benzene in the original is connected via \"-c1ccc(-c2cnn(C)c2)cc1\", so removing the substituent leaves \"-c1ccccc1\". Therefore, the scaffold is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. Wait, but that would be two rings connected. But there are three rings in the original. Wait, no: the original has three rings: first benzene, pyridine, third benzene. So the scaffold should have all three. The connecting bonds are between the benzene and pyridine, and pyridine and benzene. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1. But when written this way, the SMILES might have the two benzene rings connected via the pyridine. Alternatively, maybe it's c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccc(cc3)-c4ccccc4. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to write the SMILES step by step. First benzene: c1ccccc1 connected to the pyridine n1cccc1 via a single bond. Then the pyridine is connected to another benzene c1ccccc1 via a single bond. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. But that's two benzenes connected via a pyridine. Wait, the first part after removing substituents is c1ccccc1 connected to n1cccc1. Then that n1cccc1 is connected to another benzene. So the full scaffold would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccccc3. But in the original, the third benzene is connected via a single bond, so the correct SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. But wait, in the original, the third benzene is connected as \"-c1ccc(...)cc1\", so after removing substituents, it's \"-c1ccccc1\". So the entire scaffold is the first benzene connected to the pyridine connected to the third benzene. Therefore, the SMILES is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. But does that capture all three rings? Yes: benzene, pyridine, benzene. But wait, the pyridine is in the middle. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccccc3. However, when written in SMILES notation, the connection points need to be correctly numbered. Alternatively, maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1. But I'm not sure. Given time constraints, I'll go with the three rings connected as benzene-pyridine-benzene, so the SMILES is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. Wait, but that would have the first benzene connected to the pyridine and the pyridine connected to another benzene. So the full scaffold is the three rings linked. Therefore, the correct Murcko scaffold should be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1. However, I might be overcomplicating. Let me check once more. The input SMILES after removing all substituents: the first ring is c1ccccc1, connected via a single bond to n1cccc1 (pyridine), which is connected via a single bond to another c1ccccc1. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. But in SMILES notation, the way the connections are made matters. The actual scaffold is benzene connected to pyridine connected to benzene. So the SMILES is c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccccc3. But when written without the numbers, it might merge rings. Alternatively, using explicit numbering: c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccccc3. But SMILES allows for this. So the final answer is {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccccc3\"}? Wait, but the third benzene is connected to the pyridine. Let me look again. Original structure: the central pyridine is connected to two benzene rings. So the SMILES should have two benzene rings attached to the pyridine. The correct SMILES would be c1ccc(n2cccc2c3ccccc3)cc1. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the pyridine has two substituents: two benzene rings. But in the original, the pyridine is connected to the first benzene and then to the third benzene. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2c(ccc2-c2ccccc2)cc1. But this might not be correct. Alternatively, the scaffold is a benzene ring connected to a pyridine ring, which is connected to another benzene ring. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2-c3ccccc3)cc1. Hmm, I think I'm stuck here. Let's try to write it step by step. The first benzene: c1ccccc1. Connected to the pyridine: n1cccc1. Then the pyridine is connected to the third benzene: c1ccccc1. So combining them: c1ccc(-n2cccc2-c3ccccc3)cc1. So the full SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2-c3ccccc3)cc1. But this might not be valid. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1ccc(n2cccc2c3ccccc3)cc1. But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll settle on the scaffold being the three rings connected as benzene-pyridine-benzene, so the SMILES is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1. Therefore, the JSON output is {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c1ccccc1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, I need to extract the Murcko scaffold from the given SMILES: O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1. Let me start by identifying the rings. The molecule has a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) connected via an NC group. The benzene is attached to a carbonyl (C=O) and another carbonyl group. There's also a thiophene ring (c1cccs1) connected via a ketone (C=O). \n\nThe Murcko scaffold should retain only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So, the benzene and thiophene rings are the core. The connecting bonds between the rings are the NC and the ketone. Wait, no. The benzene is connected through NC to a chain, but that chain (C=CN) is probably a side chain. The thiophene is connected via a carbonyl, which might be part of the scaffold.\n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold removes side chains and functional groups. So, any substituents on the rings that are not part of the ring or connecting bonds should be removed. The benzene has a carbonyl group (C(=O)O) which is a functional group. The thiophene is connected via a carbonyl (O=C-), which is exocyclic. So those should be removed. The connecting bond between the benzene and the other parts might be through the N. Let me draw this mentally. The benzene has an NC=CH- group leading to the other carbonyl and thiophene. The NC part might be a connecting bond. But maybe the actual scaffold is the benzene ring connected via the N to the thiophene, but I need to check if there's a direct connection. Alternatively, the NC is part of a chain that's a side chain. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the benzene and thiophene rings are connected through a bond. Let me parse the SMILES again. The SMILES is O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1. Breaking it down: The central part is C(=O) connected to a C=CN group. The N is connected to the benzene (c1ccccc1), which has a C(=O)O group. The other part is the thiophene (c1cccs1) connected via the carbonyl. So, the main chain is the C=CN between the two carbonyl groups. But the rings are the benzene and thiophene. The Murcko scaffold would require removing all side chains and keeping the rings connected by the bonds that are part of the ring system. However, the connecting bonds here might be the NC and the carbonyl. Wait, but carbonyl is a functional group. So perhaps the actual scaffold is the benzene and thiophene rings connected via the N and the adjacent carbons? Or maybe the benzene is connected to the thiophene through a single bond via the N and the C. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to visualize. The benzene ring is connected via N-C=CH-C(=O)-thiophene. So the connecting chain is C=CH-C(=O), which is a side chain. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would just be the benzene ring and the thiophene ring connected via the N and the C=O? No, because the C=O is a functional group. Wait, the definition says to leave only the ring systems and connecting bonds. So any atoms that are part of the rings or directly connecting them. If there's a chain between two rings, that chain is considered part of the scaffold only if it's necessary to connect them. But in this case, the benzene is connected to the NC=CH-C(=O) which connects to the thiophene. The NC=CH-C(=O) is a chain, so those carbons would be removed. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would be the two rings (benzene and thiophene) connected by a single bond through the N and the adjacent carbon? Or maybe there's no direct connection between the rings once side chains are removed. Wait, maybe the benzene and thiophene are not connected in the scaffold. That can't be right. Let me think again. The original structure has the benzene attached via NC=CH-C(=O) to the thiophene. All those connecting atoms (N, C, C, O) are part of the side chain, so they should be removed. Therefore, the scaffold would just be the two separate rings? But that doesn't make sense because Murcko scaffolds typically retain the framework connecting the rings. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene and thiophene are connected through a single bond formed by removing the side chains. Let me check an example. For instance, if a molecule has two rings connected by a methyl group, the Murcko scaffold would connect the rings directly. So in this case, the NC=CH-C(=O) chain would be replaced by a single bond between the rings. But how? The actual process involves converting all acyclic atoms into single bonds if they connect rings. Wait, perhaps the Murcko scaffold is formed by converting all atoms between rings into single bonds. So, the benzene is connected to N, which is connected via C=CH-C(=O) to the thiophene. The connecting chain is N-C-C-O. But that's a chain of four atoms. According to the Murcko method, any acyclic chain connecting two rings is considered part of the scaffold if it's part of the framework. Wait, the definition says to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. The connecting chain between rings would be part of the scaffold. So, in this case, the benzene is connected via N-C-C-O to the thiophene. But wait, that's a chain of four atoms. However, the Murcko scaffold typically retains only the ring systems and the bonds that directly connect them. If there's a chain between two rings, that chain is considered part of the scaffold if it's part of the framework. For example, in the case of a benzene connected via a methylene group (-CH2-) to another ring, the scaffold would be the two rings connected by a single bond. So, perhaps in this case, the connecting chain (N-C-C-O) is considered part of the side chain and thus removed. Therefore, the scaffold would be the two rings (benzene and thiophene) without any connection. But that seems incorrect because the original molecule has a connecting chain. Alternatively, the N is part of the ring? No, the benzene ring is six carbons. The N is part of a side chain. So the benzene ring is c1ccccc1, and the N is attached to it. Then the chain C=CN connects to the carbonyl, which connects to the thiophene. So the actual scaffold would require removing all those side chains. Therefore, the benzene and thiophene rings are not connected in the scaffold. Wait, but that can't be right. The Murcko scaffold is supposed to retain the framework that connects the rings. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me recall the definition: The Murcko scaffold is the union of all rings and the connecting chains between them, with all terminal side chains removed. So, the connecting chains between rings are kept, but any branches off those chains are removed. So, in this case, between the benzene and the thiophene, there's a chain of N-C-C-O. But that chain includes a carbonyl (O), which is a functional group. So perhaps the connecting chain is N-C-C-O, but this would be considered a side chain. Wait, no. The connecting chain between the rings would be the minimal path that connects the two rings. So, the benzene is connected via N-C-C-O to the thiophene. The O is part of a carbonyl group. The connecting chain here is four atoms long (N-C-C-O), but according to the Murcko method, only the rings and the bonds directly connecting them are kept. If the connecting chain is longer than a single bond, it's considered part of the scaffold. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try breaking it down step by step.\n\nOriginal structure: benzene ring (c1ccccc1) with substituents: C(=O)O and NC=CC(=O)thiophene. The thiophene is connected via a carbonyl group. To get the Murcko scaffold, remove all side chains and functional groups. So, the benzene's substituents (C(=O)O and NC=CC(=O)thiophene) are side chains. The thiophene's substituent (the carbonyl connected to the benzene's chain) is also a side chain. Therefore, removing all these leaves the benzene and thiophene rings. But then they're not connected. That can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the N is part of the connecting chain. If the N is part of the connecting chain between the two rings, then maybe the scaffold includes the N as a bridge. Wait, but the N is in the middle of the chain. Let me imagine the structure again. The benzene has a substituent -NC=CC(=O)-thiophene. The NC=CC(=O) is a four-atom chain connecting the benzene to the thiophene. According to Murcko's definition, the scaffold includes the rings and the connecting chains. So, the scaffold would be the benzene connected via the N and the thiophene via a chain. However, the connecting chain should be reduced to single bonds. Wait, no, the connecting chain is part of the framework. But perhaps the chain is considered part of the scaffold. For example, in the case of a benzene connected via a -CH2-CH2- chain to another ring, the scaffold would include those two methylene groups. But in this case, the chain is N-C-C-O, which includes heteroatoms. However, according to the definition, all side chains and functional groups are removed. The functional groups like carbonyl (O=C) would be removed. So the connecting chain would be N-C-C-O, but the O is part of a carbonyl, which is a functional group. Therefore, the O would be removed, leaving N-C-C. But that's still three atoms. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the entire chain is considered a side chain. If the benzene and thiophene are connected via a chain that's longer than a single bond, then that chain is considered a side chain and removed. Therefore, the scaffold would be the two rings unconnected. But that doesn't seem right. I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's look for the rings and the bonds that connect them. The benzene and thiophene are the rings. The connecting path between them is through N-C=C-O. The carbonyl groups (O=C) are functional groups, so they should be removed. So, after removing the functional groups, the connecting chain becomes N-C-C. But that's three atoms. The Murcko scaffold typically only includes rings and the bonds directly connecting them. If there's a chain of atoms between rings, those are considered part of the scaffold only if they form a bridge. Otherwise, they are considered side chains. In this case, the chain N-C-C might be considered a side chain. Therefore, removing all side chains would leave the two rings unconnected. But that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the connecting chain is part of the scaffold. Let me check an example. Suppose we have a molecule like benzene-CH2-CH2-thiophene. The Murcko scaffold would be benzene-CH2-CH2-thiophene. But if the chain is longer, say benzene-CH2-CH2-CH2-thiophene, would that be part of the scaffold? Yes, because it's the connecting chain. So in this case, the chain between the benzene and thiophene is part of the scaffold. However, if the chain includes functional groups like carbonyls, those are removed. So in the given molecule, the chain is N-C=C-O. The carbonyl (O) is a functional group, so the O is removed. Then the chain becomes N-C-C. But how? Maybe the connecting chain is N-C-C, which is part of the scaffold. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the entire chain is considered a side chain. Another approach: use a tool like RDKit to perform the Murcko scaffold decomposition. But since I can't do that here, I have to reason it out. The key steps in Murcko scaffold extraction are: 1. Remove all terminal atoms (side chains) iteratively until only rings and connecting chains remain. 2. Convert any remaining connecting chains into single bonds. So, starting with the input molecule, we need to strip off all side chains. The benzene has a C(=O)O group, which is a terminal substituent (carboxylic acid), so that's removed. The thiophene has a ketone (C=O) connected to the rest, which is a substituent. The chain between the benzene and thiophene is C=CN and a carbonyl. Let's see. After removing the carboxylic acid (O=C-O) from the benzene, we're left with the benzene connected to NC=CC(=O)-thiophene. Then, the C=O on the thiophene is a substituent, so that's removed. Now the chain is NC=C. The C=C is part of the chain. But we need to remove all side chains. The chain NC=C is connecting the benzene to the thiophene. Since it's part of the connecting chain between two rings, it should be retained. However, the double bond (C=C) would be converted to a single bond. So the connecting chain becomes N-C-C. Then, the scaffold would be benzene connected via N-C-C to the thiophene. But wait, that's three atoms. But Murcko scaffolds typically have connecting chains as single bonds. Wait, maybe after converting all multiple bonds to single bonds. So the C=C becomes C-C. So the connecting chain is N-C-C. Therefore, the scaffold is benzene-N-C-C-thiophene. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, the entire chain between the rings is considered a side chain. For example, if the chain is longer than a single bond, it's a side chain. But I think the definition states that connecting chains are part of the scaffold. So, the final scaffold should have the benzene and thiophene connected via the N and two carbons. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the actual scaffold is just the benzene and thiophene rings connected via a single bond. How? Let me look at the original structure again. The benzene is connected via N to a C=CH group, which is connected to a carbonyl (C=O) that's attached to the thiophene. Removing all substituents (the carbonyl groups and the carboxylic acid), the connecting chain would be N connected to CH connected to C (from the carbonyl). But without the carbonyl, it's N-CH-C. However, that's a three-atom chain. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct scaffold is the benzene ring connected to the thiophene via a single bond. But how? There's no direct bond between them in the original structure. The original connection is through the chain. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would have the two rings connected via the shortest path. But without the chain, they're not connected. Therefore, maybe the correct scaffold is the benzene and thiophene rings not connected. But that doesn't make sense, as the original molecule has them connected via a chain. I must be missing something. Let me try to recall the exact steps for Murcko scaffold generation. The process involves converting the molecule into its framework by removing all terminal non-ring atoms. This is done by iteratively pruning terminal atoms that are not part of a ring. So, starting with the input molecule, we remove any atom that is terminal (only one bond) and not in a ring. For example, the carboxylic acid group (O=C-O) on the benzene is a terminal group. The oxygen atoms here are terminal and not in a ring, so they get removed. Then the carbonyl (C=O) attached to the thiophene is also a terminal group, so that oxygen is removed. Then, the remaining structure would have the benzene connected via NC=CC (from the original NC=CC(=O)), and the thiophene connected via C. Now, the NC=CC part: after removing the terminal O from the carbonyl, the C=O becomes C (with a double bond to the adjacent C). Then, the C=CH part: the CH is connected to the N and the C. If the CH is part of a chain, it might be a terminal atom. Wait, after removing the O from the carbonyl, the structure is benzene-N-C=C-C connected to the thiophene. The thiophene's C is now bonded to the C from the former carbonyl. So the connecting chain is N-C=C-C. But these atoms are not in a ring. Now, we check for terminal atoms. The C connected to the thiophene has three bonds: to C (from the chain), and two in the thiophene ring. Wait, the thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. The connecting C is part of the ring? No, the thiophene is c1cccs1. The connecting C would be the one attached to the sulfur. Wait, the original SMILES is O=C(...)c1cccs1. So the thiophene is connected via the carbonyl to the rest. After removing the carbonyl O, the structure is C(=O) becomes C. So the thiophene is connected via a C (from the former carbonyl) to the chain. But that C is now part of the chain. So the chain is benzene-N-C=C-C-thiophene. Now, pruning terminal atoms: the thiophene's C (from the former carbonyl) is bonded to the chain and to the sulfur in the ring. Since it's part of the ring, it's not terminal. The chain's C (the one attached to the thiophene) is bonded to two Cs (from the chain and the thiophene) and maybe another bond. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to draw it step by step.\n\nOriginal SMILES: O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe central carbonyl (O=C) is connected to a C=CN group. The N is connected to the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) which has a C(=O)O group. The other part of the central carbonyl is connected to the thiophene (c1cccs1).\n\nAfter removing terminal groups:\n\n1. Remove the carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O) from the benzene. Now the benzene is c1ccccc1 connected to N.\n\n2. Remove the carbonyl oxygen from the thiophene's side. Now the thiophene is connected to a C (from the former C=O).\n\nNow, the structure is O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1)c1cccs1. Wait, but the O=C is still there. Wait, no. The Murcko process removes all terminal groups. The central O=C is connected to the C=CN and the thiophene. The O in the O=C is a terminal group, so it should be removed. Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the connecting chain. Hmm. Maybe I need to iterate:\n\n- Start with the original molecule.\n\n- Any terminal atom (degree 1) not in a ring is pruned. The O in the carboxylic acid (C(=O)O) is terminal, so remove it. Then the carbonyl O in the C(=O)O becomes part of a carbonyl group. Wait, after removing the terminal O (the hydroxyl), the carbonyl (C=O) is still attached to the benzene. But the carbonyl O is now part of a ketone, which is not terminal (since the C is connected to the benzene and the O). The O has degree 1, so it's terminal. So the O in the carbonyl would be pruned next. Removing that O leaves the C=O as a C with a double bond to nothing? That doesn't make sense. Wait, pruning terminal atoms step by step:\n\n1. Initial structure: benzene with C(=O)O. The O in the hydroxyl group is terminal. Remove it. Now it's C(=O)O becomes C(=O).\n\n2. The carbonyl O in C(=O) is now terminal (degree 1). Remove it. Now the benzene has a CH2 group (if the C was originally C(=O)O, now it's just C). Wait, no. The original structure is benzene-C(=O)O. After removing the hydroxyl O, it's benzene-C(=O). Then removing the carbonyl O, it becomes benzene-C. But the C was originally double-bonded to O, now it's just a CH2 group attached to the benzene. Then, the structure becomes benzene-CH2.\n\nBut the original connection was via N. Let me re-express the SMILES correctly. The benzene is connected to N via a carbon chain. The full SMILES is O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1. The benzene ring is at position Nc1ccccc1C(=O)O. So the benzene has two substituents: one at the N (connected via C=CN) and one at the C(=O)O group. \n\nWhen pruning:\n\n1. The O in C(=O)O is terminal, remove it. Now the C(=O)O becomes C(=O).\n\n2. The O in the remaining C(=O) is terminal, remove it. Now it's C (with a double bond to nothing?), which isn't possible. So maybe after removing the O, the double bond is converted to a single bond. So the C=O becomes CH. So the benzene now has a CH2 group attached.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to recognize that the Murcko scaffold is the union of all rings and the connecting atoms. In this case, the benzene and thiophene are rings. The connecting atoms are N-C-C (from the chain C=CN-C(=O)), but after removing the functional groups, the connecting chain is N-C-C. Therefore, the scaffold would be benzene connected via N-C-C to the thiophene. However, converting all multiple bonds to single bonds, so the C=C becomes C-C. Thus, the scaffold is benzene-N-C-C-thiophene. But how to represent that in SMILES. Wait, but SMILES requires ring closures. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is two separate rings because the connecting chain is too long and considered a side chain. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother way to think: the original molecule's framework consists of the two rings connected by a four-atom chain (N-C=C-O). But after removing the functional groups (O), the connecting chain is N-C-C. So the scaffold is benzene-N-C-C-thiophene. But how to write that in SMILES. Maybe the SMILES would be Nc1ccccc1CCc1cccs1. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, the connecting chain is considered a side chain and removed, leaving the two rings unconnected. But that would mean the scaffold is two separate rings, which is unlikely. \n\nWait, looking up an example: if a molecule has a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2-thiophene, the Murcko scaffold would be benzene-CH2-CH2-thiophene. So the connecting chain is retained. Similarly, if the connecting chain has heteroatoms, like benzene-NH-CH2-thiophene, the scaffold would include those. Therefore, in the given molecule, after removing the functional groups (the carbonyls and hydroxyl), the connecting chain would be N-C-C. So the scaffold is benzene connected via N-C-C to the thiophene. Therefore, the SMILES would be C1=CC=CC(=C1)NCCC2=CSC=C2. Wait, but need to account for the actual connectivity. The benzene is connected to N, which is connected to C (from the former C=CH), which is connected to C (from the former carbonyl), which is connected to the thiophene. So the scaffold would be N connecting the benzene to a C-C chain leading to the thiophene. Therefore, the SMILES would be c1ccc(NCCCc2cccs2)cc1. Wait, but need to properly represent the rings. The benzene is c1ccccc1 connected to N, then CC, then the thiophene c1cccs1. So the full SMILES would be Nc1ccccc1CCc1cccs1. But I need to check the actual connectivity. The thiophene in the original structure is connected via the carbonyl carbon. After removing the carbonyl oxygen, that carbon is connected to the chain. So the chain is N-C-C connected to the thiophene. Therefore, the SMILES would be Nc1ccccc1CCc1cccs1. But I'm not sure if the thiophene's connectivity is correct. Alternatively, maybe the thiophene is connected via a single bond to the carbon chain. So the final scaffold SMILES would be Nc1ccccc1CCc1cccs1. \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: look for the core rings and any connecting atoms. The benzene and thiophene are rings. The connecting atoms are N, C, C. So the scaffold is benzene-N-C-C-thiophene. Therefore, the SMILES is c1ccc(NCCc2cccs2)cc1. But I need to ensure correct ring numbering and connectivity. Alternatively, the correct SMILES is c1cc(NC=Cc2cccs2)ccc1. No, because the C=C would be part of the chain, but after removing functional groups, it becomes C-C. So the correct scaffold SMILES would be c1cc(NCCCc2cccs2)ccc1. But I'm not sure. \n\nAfter struggling through this, I think the correct Murcko scaffold is the benzene ring connected to the thiophene ring via an N and two carbons, resulting in the SMILES: c1ccc(NCCc2cccs2)cc1. But I might have made a mistake in the connectivity. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is the two rings connected via a single bond through the N. Wait, the original connection is via N-C=CH-C(=O)-thiophene. After removing the side chains (the =O and the =CH-), the connecting chain would be N-C-C. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(NCCc2cccs2)cc1. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is just the benzene and thiophene rings without any connection. But that doesn't seem right. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the scaffold being the benzene connected to the thiophene via N and two carbons, so the SMILES is c1ccc(NCCc2cccs2)cc1. However, I need to check if the sulfur in the thiophene is correctly placed. The thiophene in the input is c1cccs1, so in the scaffold, it would still be c1cccs1. The connecting carbon would be attached to one of the carbons in the thiophene. Assuming the original connection was via the carbonyl carbon (now removed), the thiophene's connection point is the carbon adjacent to sulfur. So the scaffold SMILES would be Nc1ccccc1CCc1cccs1. To write this correctly: the benzene is c1ccccc1 connected to N, then two carbons (CC), then the thiophene c1cccs1. So the full SMILES is Nc1ccccc1CCc2cccs2. But in SMILES notation, this would be written as Nc1ccccc1CCc2cccs2. Therefore, the final answer should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"Nc1ccccc1CCc2cccs2\"}.",

Wait, the SMILES has \"c1ccco1\" which is a furan ring. Then there's another part: a pyrimidine-like ring? The central part is the \"c1nc(...)nc2ccccc12\" which forms a bicyclic system. The substituents are the N-methyl group (CN), the -c2cccc(C#N)c2 group (a benzene ring with a cyano substituent), and the furan side chain.\n\nAccording to Murcko's definition, all side chains and exocyclic groups should be removed. So the rings are the furan (c1ccco1), the benzene (from the bicyclic system), and the connecting bonds. Wait, the central bicyclic system is a quinazoline? Let me check: the core is c1nc(...)nc2ccccc12. That's a benzene ring fused to a pyrimidine, forming a quinazoline scaffold. The connecting bonds would be the ones between the rings. The side chains like the N-methyl, the cyano-substituted benzene, and the furan attached via methylene should be removed.\n\nSo stripping those substituents, the Murcko scaffold would be the quinazoline part (the fused benzene and pyrimidine rings) plus any connecting bonds. Wait, the original molecule has the quinazoline connected to the furan via a single bond? Or is the furan a side chain? The SMILES has \"CN(Cc1ccco1)\" which is a N-methyl group attached to a CH2 connected to the furan. That's a side chain, so it should be removed.

Are there any other rings connected via linkers? The furan is connected via a CH2, which is a side chain, so it's removed. The other benzene with cyano is also a substituent. Thus, the final scaffold is just the quinazoline ring system. Let me confirm: the original molecule's core is the quinazoline (fused benzene and pyrimidine), so that's the Murcko scaffold. The connecting bonds here are part of the fused rings, so no additional linkers. Therefore, the output SMILES should be the quinazoline part: c1nc2ccccc2nc1. Wait, let me write that correctly. The core structure is a benzene ring fused to a pyrimidine. The SMILES for quinazoline is c1c2c(nc(n1)c3ccccc3)ccccc2. Hmm, maybe I need to reconstruct it properly. Alternatively, looking at the original SMILES: the central part is c1nc(-c2cccc(C#N)c2)nc2ccccc12. If we remove the substituents (-c2cccc(C#N)c2 and the N-methyl with furan), the core becomes c1nc(nc2ccccc12). So the SMILES would be c1nc2ccccc2nc1. Let me check if that's correct.

The 'c2' suggests a fused ring system. The benzene (c1) is connected to another ring via the 'cc2' part. Then there's a C1CC... which is a cyclohexane or similar ring.

The second ring is a six-membered ring attached to an amide group (NC(=O)...) which connects to another benzene ring with a bromine (Br). \n\nMurcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and functional groups. So, the methyl (C), ketone (=O), amide (NC(=O)), and the bromine (Br) should be removed. The connecting bonds between the rings stay. The side chains like the amide-linked benzene ring are also removed. The remaining structure should be the two aromatic rings connected by the oxygen. Let me check: the first ring becomes o1c2ccccc2cc1, and the second is the benzene part. Wait, maybe it's a fused ring? The original SMILES has c1...c12, indicating a fused bicyclic system. So after removing substituents, the scaffold is the fused rings without substituents. The correct SMILES would be O=C1OC2=CC=CC=C2C1. Wait, but the ketone is a functional group. Oh, the definition says to remove exocyclic modifications. The =O on the oxygen might be part of the ring? Let me draw it out. The original ring is c1cc(=O)oc2... So the oxygen is part of the ring, and the =O is an exocyclic double bond. So the scaffold would have the oxygen in the ring but without the =O. Wait, but the original SMILES has oc2, which is O connected to the second ring. Maybe the rings are connected via an oxygen bridge. After removing substituents, the scaffold should be the two fused rings connected by the oxygen. Wait, no, the input has c1cc(=O)oc2cc... which suggests that the first ring is a five-membered ring: positions 1 (methyl), 2 (C=O), 4 (O connected to the second ring). Then the second ring is six-membered. So the fused system is a bicyclic structure with an oxygen bridge. Removing all substituents: the methyl, the ketone (converting the C=O to just C-O?), no. Wait, the Murcko scaffold retains the ring atoms and connecting bonds. So the rings and the connecting bonds (like the oxygen) stay. Any substituents attached to the rings (like methyl, Br, amide groups) are removed. So the scaffold would be the fused rings without substituents. Let me reconstruct: the first ring is a five-membered ring with oxygen, originally with a methyl and a ketone. Remove those, so it's O as part of the ring. The second ring is a benzene ring. So the SMILES would be O1C2=CC=CC=C2C=C1. Wait, maybe I need to write it correctly. Alternatively, maybe it's c1c2c(oc1)cccc2. Wait, perhaps better to process step by step. The original molecule has a central fused ring system where the first ring is a five-membered ring (with O and a ketone) fused to a benzene ring. The Murcko scaffold would retain the fused rings but without substituents. So the ketone (=O) is removed, the methyl (C) is removed, the amide and the bromine ring are also side chains. The final scaffold is the fused bicyclic system: the five-membered ring (without substituents) fused to the six-membered benzene. So the correct SMILES should be O=C1OC2=CC=CC=C2C1. Wait, but the ketone is part of the ring? If the original ring has a carbonyl, then removing it would break the ring. Hmm, maybe I need to check if the carbonyl is part of the ring. In the SMILES, the first ring is written as c1cc(=O)oc2... The sequence is C1 connected to C, then another C, then (=O), then O connected to C2. So the ring closure is between the first C (position 1) and the O (position 4?), making a five-membered ring: positions 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (C=O), 4 (O), 5 (C2), and back to position 1. Wait, that would make a five-membered ring with O and a carbonyl. But the carbonyl is exocyclic because the double bond is to an oxygen not part of the ring. So the Murcko scaffold would remove that carbonyl, leaving the oxygen in the ring. So the ring becomes c1ccoc2... So the scaffold would be the fused rings without substituents. So the five-membered ring is c1ccoc2, fused to the benzene cccc12. So the SMILES would be O1C2=CC=CC=C2C=C1. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to write the scaffold step by step. Original rings: the first ring is a five-membered ring with atoms C, C, C(=O), O, and C connected to the second ring. The second ring is a benzene. Removing substituents: the methyl (Cc1...), the =O (convert to single bond?), the amide group (NC(=O)...), and the Br. The rings remain, connected by the oxygen. So the scaffold is the fused rings: the five-membered ring (now without =O, so just C-O-C) fused to the benzene. Wait, but in SMILES notation, how to represent that. Maybe the correct scaffold is O1C2=CC=CC=C2C=C1. Alternatively, c1c2c(oc1)cccc2. Let me verify. If the original structure is Cc1cc(=O)oc2cc(...)ccc12, then the rings are fused between position 1 and position 5 (since the closure is 1 and 2 in the second part). Wait, SMILES notation for rings: the numbers indicate the closure points. So c1...ccc12 means that the first ring (labeled 1) is connected to the second ring (labeled 2) at the closure points. So the structure is a bicyclic system where the two rings share a common bond. After removing all substituents, the scaffold is the bicyclic system without any branches. The five-membered ring would have an oxygen atom. So the SMILES would be O1C2=CC=CC=C2C=C1. Alternatively, it's a furan ring fused to a benzene. Wait, furan is O in a five-membered ring. So the scaffold would be the benzofuran system. But benzofuran's SMILES is O=C1C=CC=Cc2ccccc12? No, benzofuran is O1C=CC=C2C1=CC=CC2. Wait, maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc2c(c1)occc2. But in the original molecule, the oxygen is part of the five-membered ring connected to the benzene. So after removing substituents, it's a benzofuran-like structure. The correct SMILES for benzofuran is c1ccc2c(c1)occc2. But the original molecule has the substituents removed. So yes, the Murcko scaffold would be the benzofuran system: O1C2=C(C=CC=C2)C=C1. However, in the input, the fusion might be different. Let me count: the original SMILES is Cc1cc(=O)oc2cc(...)ccc12. Breaking it down, the first ring (1) is connected via the oxygen to the second ring (2). So the rings are fused via the oxygen? Or are they separate rings connected by a single bond? Wait, the SMILES is written as c1cc(=O)oc2cc...ccc12. The 'o' is part of the first ring. So the first ring is five-membered: positions 1 (C from Cc1), 2 (C from cc(=O)), 3 (C with =O), 4 (O from oc2), and 5 (C from c2), then back to position 1. So the first ring is five-membered: C-C-C(=O)-O-C connected back to the first C. The second ring is six-membered: positions 1 (C connected to O), 2 (C from cc(...)), etc., closing back to position 1. Wait, the closure is c2cc(...)ccc12, which means the second ring (labeled 2) starts at the O-connected C, then goes through several carbons, and closes back to the first ring's position 1. So the two rings share a common bond, making a fused bicyclic system. Therefore, the scaffold is this fused system without substituents. So removing the methyl (=Cc1), the =O, the amide group, and the Br, the scaffold is the fused rings: the five-membered ring (now without =O) and the six-membered benzene. Wait, but the =O is part of the ring? If you remove the =O, the ring would have a single bond there. But in SMILES, the ring must be properly closed. So perhaps the original ring has a carbonyl group as part of the ring, which is not possible because a five-membered ring with a carbonyl would be a lactone or similar. But in this case, the SMILES is written as cc(=O)o, which suggests that the carbonyl is a substituent, not part of the ring. Wait, the SMILES is c1cc(=O)oc2... So the first ring is c1 (C), c (C), c(=O) (C with =O), o (O), c2 (C connected to the second ring), and back to c1. So that's a five-membered ring: C-C-C-O-C, but the third C has a double bond to O. Wait, that can't be right because in a five-membered ring, a carbonyl would require adjacent atoms. Maybe the structure is a furanone. So the five-membered ring is a cyclic ester (lactone), which includes the carbonyl. In that case, the Murcko scaffold would retain the ring atoms and the connecting bonds. So the carbonyl is part of the ring system and should be kept. Wait, the definition says to remove exocyclic modifications. If the carbonyl is part of the ring (i.e., endocyclic), then it stays. But in a five-membered ring, a carbonyl would be part of the ring. For example, furan-2-one has a structure like O=C1OC=CC1. So in this case, the carbonyl is part of the ring. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would include that carbonyl. So the scaffold would be the fused system of the five-membered ring (with the carbonyl) and the benzene ring. But wait, the definition says to remove all functional groups. Wait, the Murcko scaffold is supposed to leave only the ring systems and connecting bonds. Functional groups attached to the rings are removed. But if the carbonyl is part of the ring (i.e., in the ring skeleton), then it's considered part of the scaffold. For example, in a lactam or lactone, the carbonyl is part of the ring and thus retained. So in this case, the five-membered ring includes the carbonyl oxygen, making it a cyclic ketone or ester. Therefore, the scaffold would include that. So the SMILES would be O=C1OC2=CC=CC=C2C1. Let me check: the original rings are a five-membered ring with the carbonyl, fused to a benzene. The connecting bond is between the O and the benzene. So the scaffold is O=C1OC2=CC=CC=C2C1. Yes, that makes sense. The methyl, amide, and bromine are all side chains removed. The carbonyl is part of the ring, so it stays. Therefore, the correct output is {\"Output Scaffold\": \"O=C1OC2=CC=CC=C2C1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is COc1ccc(C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2)cc1OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the ring systems. The main structure has two benzene rings connected by an oxygen atom. The first part is COc1ccc...cc1O... which suggests a benzene ring with two oxygen-containing substituents. Then there's a C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2 group attached. The c2nccs2 is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens and a sulfur, probably a thiazole ring. So that's another ring system.\n\nNext, the OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1 part is a morpholine-like ring but with a substituent. The core rings here are the benzene rings and the thiazole. The connecting bonds between them would be the oxygen linking the two benzene rings and the amide connecting to the thiazole.\n\nNow, removing all side chains and exocyclic groups: the methyl groups (C), the carbonyl (C=O) from the amide, the ethyl or other chains attached to the nitrogen in the morpholine ring, and the methoxy groups (OCH3) on the benzene rings. Wait, the methoxy groups (OC) are substituents on the benzene, so those should be removed. The amide link (NC) is part of the side chain connecting to the thiazole, so that might be a connecting bond. Wait, the Murcko scaffold keeps the rings and the connecting bonds. So the amide group between the benzene and thiazole might be considered a connecting bond. But according to the definition, connecting bonds are the ones that link ring systems. The amide is part of the side chain, so perhaps we need to remove that, keeping only the rings and the direct linkers between them.\n\nWait, the connecting bonds are the atoms that are part of the rings' link. For example, if two rings are connected by a single bond (like O connecting two benzene rings), that bond is kept. But functional groups like amides, esters, etc., are removed. So in the input molecule, the benzene ring has a methoxy group (OCH3), which is a substituent and should be removed. The C(=O)NC... part is a side chain leading to the thiazole ring. So the thiazole is connected via a single bond from the benzene through the amide group. But the amide is not a ring, so perhaps that part is removed. Therefore, the scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by oxygen, and the thiazole ring connected via a single bond to the benzene? Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it out.\n\nOriginal structure: Benzene ring (with OCH3 groups) connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), then an NH connected to a CH2 group, then the thiazole ring. Then another oxygen connected to a morpholine-like ring with substituents.\n\nSo the core rings are the two benzene rings (connected by oxygen?), the thiazole, and the morpholine ring? Wait, the morpholine-like part is OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1. The oxygen is part of the ring? So that's a six-membered ring with one oxygen and one nitrogen. But the C(C)C is a substituent on the nitrogen. So the core here would be the oxygen-containing ring (like morpholine) but without the substituents. So removing the C(C)C (isopropyl group) from the nitrogen.\n\nPutting it all together: The main scaffold would be the benzene rings connected via an oxygen (so the O is part of the linker), the thiazole ring connected via a bond (but maybe through a linker?), and the morpholine ring. Wait, but the original molecule has the benzene ring connected to the thiazole via a C(=O)NC chain. The Murcko scaffold removes all side chains, so that chain would be reduced to a single bond? Or perhaps that entire chain is removed, leaving only the benzene and thiazole rings if they are part of the same ring system. Hmm, maybe not. The Murcko scaffold is supposed to leave the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So any bonds that are between rings are kept as part of the scaffold. So for example, if two rings are connected by a chain of atoms that are not part of any ring, but those chains are considered linkers, then only the minimal connecting bonds are kept. Wait, the Murcko scaffold is obtained by iteratively removing terminal acyclic atoms until only rings and the connecting chains remain. So the process is: remove all side chains and functional groups, keeping the rings and the bonds that connect them. For example, in a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2-benzene, the scaffold would be benzene-benzene connected by a single bond (but actually, the CH2-CH2 would be the connecting chain, so the scaffold would be the two benzenes connected by a single bond if that's considered the minimum linker. Wait, but the Murcko method typically retains the bridge or linker atoms between rings. Let me recall: the algorithm involves converting all atoms to carbons, breaking all exocyclic bonds, then the scaffold is the framework of rings and bridges. So in the case of benzene-O-benzene, the oxygen is part of the connecting bridge and is retained. Similarly, if there's a chain like benzene-CH2-NH-benzene, the NH would be part of the bridge and retained. But functional groups like carbonyls, amides, etc., are removed. So in the given molecule, the benzene rings connected by oxygen (O) would be part of the scaffold. The thiazole ring is connected via a side chain (C(=O)NC(C)...), so that chain would be removed, leaving the benzene and thiazole rings connected by a single bond if that's part of the linker. Wait, but if the thiazole is connected via a single bond to the benzene, then it's part of the scaffold. But in the given molecule, the thiazole is attached via a C(=O)NC(C) group. That chain would be considered a side chain, so it's removed. Therefore, the thiazole would not be part of the scaffold unless it's directly connected via a bond to another ring. Wait, perhaps I need to look at the exact structure. Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nThe SMILES is COc1ccc(C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2)cc1OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is COc1ccc(...)cc1O...: The benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1) has two O-containing groups: COc (methoxy) at position 1 and another O connected to C1... which is part of the next ring.\n\nThe central benzene ring has a substituent: C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2. Let's parse that: C(=O) is a carbonyl group attached to the benzene. Then NC(C)c2nccs2: an amide nitrogen connected to a CH2 group (C(C)? Wait, NC(C) would be N-C(C), which is N connected to a CH2 group (maybe isopropyl?), which then connects to the thiazole ring (c2nccs2). The thiazole ring is c2nccs2, which is a five-membered ring with positions: 1 (carbon), 2 (nitrogen), 3 (carbon), 4 (carbon), 5 (sulfur). So the thiazole is connected via a CH2 group to the amide nitrogen, which is connected to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene.\n\nSo the thiazole is connected through a chain (C(=O)NC(C)) to the benzene. This chain is a side chain and should be removed in the Murcko scaffold. Therefore, the thiazole would not be part of the scaffold. Similarly, the morpholine-like ring (OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1) is attached via an oxygen to the benzene. The morpholine ring itself (O connected to C1, then a chain of C-C-N-C-C) is a six-membered ring. However, the nitrogen in this ring has a substituent C(C)C (isopropyl group), which is a side chain and should be removed. Therefore, the morpholine ring would be part of the scaffold, but without the isopropyl group.\n\nPutting it all together: The main scaffold includes the two benzene rings connected by oxygen (from the original O linking them?), the morpholine ring connected via oxygen to the benzene, but wait, the original structure has the benzene connected to O, then the morpholine ring. Wait, the SMILES is ...cc1OC1CCN... The 'O' is part of the morpholine ring? Let me parse that part again: OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1. The O is directly connected to C1, which is part of the ring. So the morpholine ring is O-C1-C-C-N-C-C-C1. Wait, that's a six-membered ring: O, C1, C, C, N, C, C, and back to C1? No, the SMILES notation for the ring is OC1CCN(...)CC1. So the ring is O-C1-C-C-N(...)-C-C1. So the ring atoms are O, C1, C, C, N, C, C, forming a seven-membered ring? Wait, no, the numbers in SMILES denote the ring closures. So OC1CCN(...)CC1 means that after the O, the C1 is the first atom of the ring. Then the sequence is O-C1-C-C-N(...)-C-C-C1. Wait, no: OC1CCN(...)CC1 would be O connected to C1, then three Cs (C-C-C), then N with substituents, then two Cs (C-C), and closing the ring back to C1. So the ring has seven atoms? O-C-C-C-N-C-C-C1? That would make a seven-membered ring. But that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring. Let me count: O connected to C1, then C, C, N, C, C, and back to C1. That's six atoms: O-C1-C2-C3-N-C5-C6-C1. Wait, that's seven atoms. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Regardless, the key point is that the morpholine-like ring is a heterocycle with O and N. The substituent on the N is C(C)C, which is an isopropyl group and should be removed. So the scaffold for this part would be the ring without the isopropyl.\n\nSo, combining all these, the Murcko scaffold should consist of:\n\n1. The central benzene ring (originally with substituents that are now removed).\n2. Connected via an oxygen to another benzene ring (but wait, the original SMILES has COc1ccc(...)cc1OC... So the benzene ring has two O-linked groups: one methoxy (which is removed) and another O connected to the morpholine ring. Wait, the original benzene is c1ccc(C(=O)NC(...))cc1OC(...). So the benzene has a substituent at one position (C(=O)NC...) and another substituent at another position which is O connected to the morpholine ring. After removing the side chains, the benzene rings would remain, connected via the oxygen to the morpholine ring, and the thiazole ring might be removed as it's connected via a side chain.\n\nWait, but the thiazole is a ring system. So the question is whether the thiazole is part of the scaffold. The thiazole is connected via a chain (C(=O)NHCH2...) to the benzene. That chain is acyclic and should be removed. Therefore, the thiazole ring would not be part of the scaffold. Similarly, the morpholine-like ring's substituent (isopropyl) is removed, so the scaffold includes the morpholine ring (without substituents) connected via oxygen to the benzene.\n\nBut wait, the original benzene has two substituents: the morpholine-O and the C(=O)... chain. After removing the C(=O)... chain, the benzene remains connected to the morpholine ring via oxygen. But the other benzene ring (from COc1ccc...) is part of the same benzene? No, the SMILES starts with COc1ccc(...)cc1OC(...), which is a single benzene ring with two oxygen-containing substituents: one methoxy (COc) and another O connected to the morpholine ring. So the main benzene ring has two substituents: OMe (which is removed) and O-morpholine (which is kept as part of the scaffold). The other part is the C(=O)NC(...) substituent, which leads to the thiazole. Removing that substituent leaves the benzene connected to the morpholine ring via oxygen. So the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via oxygen to the morpholine ring. But is there any other ring?\n\nWait, the thiazole ring is a separate ring, but it's connected via a side chain, so it's removed. The morpholine-like ring is part of the scaffold. So the final scaffold is the benzene ring connected via an oxygen to the morpholine ring. But the original structure also has another benzene? No, the SMILES describes one benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1) with substituents. The COc1... part is a single benzene ring with methoxy and other groups. So after removing the side chains, the scaffold is the benzene ring connected via oxygen to the morpholine ring. Additionally, the morpholine ring itself is a six-membered ring with O and N. But when the substituent (isopropyl) is removed, the morpholine ring remains.\n\nWait, but in the morpholine ring, the nitrogen has a substituent C(C)C. Removing that leaves the nitrogen with a hydrogen. So the scaffold would have the morpholine ring (O and N in the ring) connected via oxygen to the benzene. Is there any other ring? The thiazole is gone. So the final scaffold is benzene-O-morpholine (without substituents). But the original SMILES also has the C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2 group attached to the benzene. Removing that, the benzene remains with the O-morpholine substituent. So the scaffold is the benzene connected to the morpholine via oxygen. But wait, the definition says to leave ring systems and connecting bonds. If the morpholine is a ring system and the benzene is another, connected by an oxygen atom (a single bond), then the scaffold would be benzene-O-morpholine. But according to the Murcko rules, connecting atoms (like the oxygen) are retained. So the SMILES for the scaffold would be c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1, but wait, the morpholine ring in the input is OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1. After removing the C(C)C substituent, the ring becomes OC1CCNCC1. So the morpholine ring is O-C1-C-C-N-C-C-C1 (but that's seven atoms? Wait, no, the SMILES OC1CCNCC1 would be a six-membered ring: O connected to C1, then C-C-N-C-C, and back to C1, making a six-membered ring: O, C1, C2, C3, N, C4, C5, C1? No, wait, OC1CCNCC1 would be O-C1-C2-C3-N-C5-C6-C1? No, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's write it out:\n\nO-C1-C2-C3-C4-N-C5-C1. That's seven atoms, which is not possible. Wait, maybe it's O-C1-C2-C3-N-C5-C6-C1? No, the correct way is OC1CCNCC1: O connected to C1, then two Cs (C2, C3), then N, then two Cs (C4, C5), and back to C1. That makes a six-membered ring: O-C1-C2-C3-N-C5-C1. Wait, that's six atoms: O, C1, C2, C3, N, C5, and back to C1. No, that's six members: O, C1, C2, C3, N, C5, which would require a closure from C5 back to C1. That's not possible unless there's a mistake. Maybe the correct interpretation is OC1CCNCC1 as a six-membered ring: O-C1-C2-C3-N-C4-C5-C1? No, perhaps the correct SMILES for morpholine is C1COCCN1, which is a six-membered ring with O and N. But in this case, the input SMILES has OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1. Removing the substituent C(C)C gives OC1CCNCC1. So the ring is O-C1-C2-C3-C4-N-C5-C1. That's seven atoms, which isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the SMILES parsing. Alternatively, maybe the ring is written as OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1, which is a seven-membered ring. But that's unusual. Regardless, the key point is that the substituent on the N is removed, leaving the ring as a heterocycle. \n\nIn any case, the main scaffold will include the benzene ring connected to the oxygen, which is part of the morpholine-like ring. The thiazole and other substituents are removed. So the final scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1. But I need to make sure the ring closures are correct. Alternatively, perhaps the morpholine ring is O-C1-C-C-N-C-C (six-membered), so SMILES would be O1CCNCC1. Then connecting to the benzene via oxygen: c1ccc(O2CCNCC2)cc1. But wait, the benzene is c1ccc(...)cc1, and the oxygen is attached to the benzene and the morpholine ring. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(O2CCNCC2)cc1. But in the original SMILES, the benzene is connected to O, which is part of the morpholine ring. Therefore, the correct scaffold would have the benzene linked to the morpholine ring via an oxygen. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1. However, the original morpholine ring in the input has OC1CCN... which after removing substituents becomes OC1CCNCC1. But that would be O connected to C1, then C-C-N-C-C-C1, forming a six-membered ring. So the SMILES for the morpholine part is O1CCNCC1. But when connected to the benzene via oxygen, it's O-C1CCNCC1. Wait, no: in the input, the benzene is attached to the oxygen, which is part of the morpholine ring. So the SMILES would be benzene-O-C1CCNCC1. But the correct SMILES for that would be c1ccc(Oc2ccccc2)cc1 but in this case, the O is part of the morpholine ring. Wait, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1ccc(O2CCNCC2)cc1. Let me check: the benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1) has an oxygen connected to a six-membered ring (O2CCNCC2). So the SMILES would be c1ccc(O2CCNCC2)cc1. \n\nAdditionally, is there another ring in the scaffold? The original molecule's C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2 part would have the thiazole ring (c2nccs2), but since it's connected via a side chain, it's removed. So the scaffold only includes the benzene and the morpholine-like ring connected via oxygen. \n\nTherefore, the final scaffold SMILES should be c1ccc(O2CCNCC2)cc1. Let me validate that. The benzene ring (c1ccc(O2CCNCC2)cc1) has an oxygen connected to a six-membered ring containing O, C, C, N, C, C. Wait, the morpholine ring in the input after removing substituents is O-C1-C-C-N-C-C, forming a six-membered ring. So the SMILES for the morpholine ring is O1CCNCC1. Therefore, the benzene connected to this via oxygen would be O1CCNCC1 connected to the benzene as O1, so the full SMILES is c1ccc(O2CCNCC2)cc1. Yes, that makes sense. So the output scaffold is c1ccc(O2CCNCC2)cc1.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is O=C(c1ccccc1)N1CCCC(Nc2ccc(F)cc2)C1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the rings. The benzene ring is obvious here: c1ccccc1. Then there's a cyclohexane-like ring: N1CCCC...C1. Wait, the nitrogen is part of the ring, so that's a six-membered ring with one nitrogen. \n\nNext, the connecting bonds. The carbonyl group (O=C) is attached to the benzene, but that's a side chain, so it gets removed. The amide group (N connected to the carbonyl) might be part of the ring? Wait, the ring is N1CCCC...C1. The nitrogen in the ring has a connection to the benzene via the carbonyl, but that's a substituent, so we should remove the O=C part. \n\nThen there's the N attached to the cyclohexane ring with a NH group connected to another benzene ring (c2ccc(F)cc2). The fluorine is a substituent on that benzene, so that entire side chain (Nc2ccc(F)cc2) would be removed, leaving just the cyclohexane ring connected to the benzene. Wait, no. Wait, the main rings are the benzene (from c1ccccc1) and the cyclohexane (N1CCCCC1). But the cyclohexane is connected via the amide group to the benzene. Wait, the original structure is O=C(c1ccccc1)N1CCCC(Nc2ccc(F)cc2)C1. So the main rings are the benzene (from the c1ccccc1 part), the cyclohexane ring (N1CCCCC1), and another benzene (c2ccc...cc2). But the fluorine is a substituent on the second benzene. So the Murcko scaffold should include all ring systems and the connecting bonds. The connecting bonds between the rings. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nOriginal structure: The central part is the cyclohexane ring (N1CCCC(C1)...). The nitrogen in the cyclohexane is connected to the carbonyl group (O=C), which is attached to the first benzene. Then another nitrogen in the cyclohexane is connected to the second benzene (via Nc2...). The fluorine on the second benzene is a substituent, so remove that. So the rings are the first benzene, the cyclohexane, and the second benzene (without the fluorine). The connecting bonds are the amide link (which is part of the side chain?) Wait, the Murcko scaffold keeps the rings and the connecting bonds. So any bonds that are between rings or part of the ring systems. The O=C is a functional group attached to the benzene, so that would be removed. Similarly, the NH connecting to the second benzene is a side chain. Wait, but the second benzene is connected via a single bond to the cyclohexane's nitrogen. Is that part of the scaffold? The Murcko scaffold definition says to leave ring systems and connecting bonds. So the rings here are the first benzene (c1ccccc1), the cyclohexane (N1CCCCC1), and the second benzene (c2cccc2, without F). The connecting bonds would be the bonds that link these rings. So the cyclohexane's nitrogen is connected to the first benzene via a carbonyl group (which is a functional group, so remove that part), so the actual connecting bond would be the bond between the cyclohexane nitrogen and the adjacent atoms. Wait, perhaps I need to remove all side chains and functional groups. The original molecule has O=C attached to the benzene, which is a functional group. The NH connecting to the second benzene is a side chain. So the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected to the cyclohexane ring via a bond, and the cyclohexane connected to the second benzene via another bond? Wait, no. Let me visualize the structure.\n\nThe main structure: The cyclohexane ring (N1CCCC...C1) has two substituents: one is the O=C-benzene group, and the other is the NH-benzene (with F). To get the Murcko scaffold, we need to remove all side chains. The rings are the benzene (from O=C), the cyclohexane, and the other benzene (from NH). But the connecting atoms are the nitrogen in the cyclohexane. Wait, the Murcko scaffold connects the rings through the bonds that are part of the framework. So, if the cyclohexane is connected via single bonds to the benzene rings, those bonds would be part of the scaffold. But wait, in the original molecule, the benzene rings are attached via functional groups (like amide). The Murcko scaffold would remove those functional groups. So, the scaffold would only include the rings that are fused or connected via single bonds without any intervening functional groups. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to draw it:\n\nOriginal SMILES: O=C(c1ccccc1)N1CCCC(Nc2ccc(F)cc2)C1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The part O=C(c1ccccc1) is a benzoyl group attached to the nitrogen of the cyclohexane ring (N1...). Then the cyclohexane ring (N1CCCC...C1) has another substituent: N connected to a benzene ring with F (Nc2ccc(F)cc2).\n\nMurcko scaffold requires removing all substituents except rings and the connecting bonds. So:\n\n1. The benzoyl group (O=C-) is a side chain, so remove it. So the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) is retained only if it's part of the core ring system. Wait, no. The benzoyl is a substituent on the cyclohexane's nitrogen. So the cyclohexane is the core ring. The benzene attached via the carbonyl is a substituent, so it's removed. Similarly, the NH-benzene-F group is a substituent on the cyclohexane, so that benzene is also removed. Wait, but maybe the benzene rings are connected via the cyclohexane. Wait, maybe I need to check if the benzene rings are part of the framework. Hmm. Alternatively, the Murcko scaffold is formed by the union of all ring systems in the molecule, connected by the linker bonds. So in this case, the molecule has three rings: two benzene rings and the cyclohexane. But they are connected via single bonds with functional groups. So the Murcko scaffold would be the individual rings plus the connecting bonds. But wait, the connecting bonds here are through the amide and the amine groups, which are considered side chains. So those would be removed, leaving only the rings. But that can't be right. The Murcko scaffold should include the rings and any connecting chains between them. Wait, the definition says \"ring systems and connecting bonds\". Connecting bonds are the bonds that link the rings. So for example, if two rings are connected by a single bond with no substituents, that bond is part of the scaffold. But if there's a substituent (like an amide group) between two rings, that substituent is removed, and the rings are considered as separate. Wait, no. Let me check an example. For example, in aspirin, the scaffold would be the two fused rings (benzene and the oxygen-containing ring), with the ester group removed. But if two rings are connected via a methyl group, the methyl is removed, so the scaffold would be the two rings connected by a single bond (the former methyl's position). Wait, maybe the connecting bonds are the bonds that are part of the shortest path between rings. So, in this molecule, the cyclohexane is connected to the first benzene via an amide group (O=C-N-), which is a side chain, so that would be removed. Similarly, the cyclohexane is connected to the second benzene via an amine group (N-), which is also a side chain. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would be just the cyclohexane ring, because the benzene rings are connected via side chains. But that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Another example: in diphenhydramine, the scaffold is the two benzene rings connected by an oxygen, which is part of the connecting chain. Wait, no, the Murcko scaffold would remove the oxygen and just have the two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The Murcko scaffold is obtained by pruning all side chains, so any atom that is not part of a ring or a connecting bond between rings is removed. The connecting bonds are the ones that are part of the framework linking the rings. So, for the input molecule, the rings are the cyclohexane and the two benzene rings. But how are they connected? The first benzene is attached via an amide group (which is a side chain), so it's removed. The second benzene is attached via an amine group (also a side chain), so it's removed. Thus, the only ring left is the cyclohexane. But that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the benzene rings are part of the scaffold if they are connected via a bond that is part of the framework. Wait, perhaps the entire structure after removing substituents is the cyclohexane with two benzene rings attached via single bonds. Wait, but in the original structure, the benzene rings are connected through the cyclohexane via functional groups. Let me try to process it step by step.\n\n1. Identify all rings. The first benzene (c1ccccc1), the cyclohexane (N1CCCCC1), and the second benzene (c2ccc(F)cc2). The fluorine is a substituent on the second benzene.\n\n2. Remove all substituents. So, remove the O=C group attached to the first benzene. That leaves the first benzene as a separate ring? Or is it attached via the amide's nitrogen to the cyclohexane? Wait, the SMILES is O=C(c1ccccc1)N1CCCC(Nc2ccc(F)cc2)C1. So the cyclohexane ring is N1 connected to the carbonyl group (O=C), which is connected to the first benzene. The other nitrogen in the cyclohexane is connected to the second benzene via NH.\n\nTo get the scaffold, remove all side chains and functional groups. So, the O=C group is a functional group, so we remove it. That breaks the connection between the first benzene and the cyclohexane. Similarly, the NH group connecting the cyclohexane to the second benzene is a side chain, so we remove that. The fluorine on the second benzene is a substituent, so remove that as well.\n\nSo after removing these, what's left? The cyclohexane ring (N1CCCCC1) with no substituents. The two benzene rings are now disconnected because their connecting groups (O=C and NH) have been removed. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would only be the cyclohexane ring. But that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene rings are part of the scaffold if they are connected via the framework. Wait, perhaps the connecting bonds are the ones that are part of the shortest path between rings. Let's see. The original molecule has three rings. The first benzene is connected to the cyclohexane via the amide group. The second benzene is connected via an amine. The Murcko scaffold would require that only the rings and the bonds that directly connect them are kept. So if there's a chain of atoms between two rings, that chain is considered a linker and kept if it's necessary to connect the rings. For example, in biphenyl, the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond, so that's part of the scaffold. But if they're connected by an ester group, the ester is removed, and the rings are separate. So in this case, the first benzene is connected via an amide (O=C-N-) to the cyclohexane. The amide is a functional group, so it's removed. Therefore, the benzene is no longer connected to the cyclohexane. Similarly, the second benzene is connected via an amine (N-), which is also a side chain. So removing that would disconnect the second benzene. Therefore, the only ring left is the cyclohexane. But that seems incorrect. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition. Let me check the definition again: \"leaving only the ring systems and connecting bonds.\" Connecting bonds are the bonds that link the ring systems. So any bonds that are part of the framework connecting the rings are kept. If the rings are connected via a chain of atoms that are not part of a ring, but are necessary to connect the rings, those atoms are kept as the connecting bonds. For example, in a molecule with two benzene rings connected by a methyl group, the Murcko scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by a single bond (the methyl is reduced to a connecting bond). But in our case, the benzene rings are connected via the cyclohexane. Wait, the cyclohexane is a ring itself. So the scaffold would consist of the cyclohexane ring, but the two benzene rings are attached via functional groups, which are side chains. Therefore, the scaffold is just the cyclohexane. However, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the benzoyl group (O=C-) is a substituent on the cyclohexane's nitrogen. Removing substituents would leave the cyclohexane as the core. But wait, the first benzene is part of a ring system. Wait, no, the first benzene is a separate ring connected via a functional group. So the Murcko scaffold would not include it. Similarly for the second benzene. Therefore, the scaffold is just the cyclohexane ring. But that seems too simplistic. Maybe I'm missing that the cyclohexane is part of a larger ring system. Wait, the SMILES is O=C(c1ccccc1)N1CCCC(Nc2ccc(F)cc2)C1. The cyclohexane is N1 connected to CCCC and then back to C1. So the cyclohexane is a six-membered ring with one nitrogen. The other substituents are the O=C-benzene and the NH-benzene-F. Removing those substituents leaves the cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the output should be the SMILES of the cyclohexane ring: N1CCCCC1. But wait, in SMILES notation, the nitrogen would have a valence issue. Let me check. The cyclohexane ring with one nitrogen would have the SMILES as N1CCCCC1. But the nitrogen in that ring would have two bonds: one to the adjacent carbons in the ring. Wait, but in reality, the nitrogen in the cyclohexane would have three bonds. The ring is N connected to two carbons (as part of the ring), and the third bond is to the substituent (the O=C-benzene). But when we remove the substituent, the nitrogen should have a hydrogen. However, SMILES doesn't explicitly show hydrogens. So the SMILES would be N1CCCCC1, which is a cyclohexane with one nitrogen, but that's not a valid valence. Wait, perhaps the original structure has the nitrogen in the cyclohexane as part of an amide group. So when we remove the substituents, the nitrogen would have a hydrogen, making it a secondary amine. But in SMILES, the implicit hydrogen is allowed. So the SMILES N1CCCCC1 represents a six-membered ring with one nitrogen and the rest carbons, each with two hydrogens. But is that correct? Maybe the actual scaffold is just the cyclohexane ring with the nitrogen, so the SMILES is N1CCCCC1. However, the benzene rings are not part of the scaffold because they are connected via substituents. Therefore, the final answer should be the cyclohexane ring's SMILES: N1CCCCC1.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a SMILES string and wants the Murcko scaffold. The input is CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(COC(=O)c2ccccc2)C1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES. Let me break it down. The main structure seems to have two benzene rings connected via a sulfur atom with sulfonyl groups. There's a cyclohexane ring (from the C1(CC) part) with substituents like C(=O)N and maybe a sulfur bridge.\n\nWait, the SMILES is CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(COC(=O)c2ccccc2)C1S(=O)(=O)c3ccccc3. So the core rings would be the cyclohexane (from the C1...C1 part) connected to the sulfur, which is connected to another benzene ring (c3ccccc3). The other benzene (c2ccccc2) is part of an ester group (COC(=O)), which is a side chain attached to the nitrogen. Also, there are substituents like CCC and CC on the cyclohexane, which are side chains.\n\nAccording to Murcko's definition, I need to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. So the cyclohexane ring (C1CCCC1?) Wait, the actual structure here is CCC1(CC)...C1. Wait, the core ring might be a six-membered ring with some substituents. But maybe the CCC and CC are substituents, so they should be removed. The sulfonyl groups (S(=O)(=O)) are part of the connecting bonds between the cyclohexane and the benzene. The ester group (COC(=O)c2ccccc2) attached to the nitrogen is a side chain, so that should be removed. Similarly, the CCC and CC on the cyclohexane are side chains. So stripping those, the core would be the cyclohexane ring connected via sulfonyl groups to a benzene. Wait, but maybe the cyclohexane is part of a bicyclic system? Let me visualize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main scaffold is the central ring (maybe a six-membered ring with N and S). Let me check the connectivity. The SMILES is CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(...)C1S... So the central ring is a six-membered ring where positions are connected via C1. Wait, the C1 is part of a cyclohexane? Let me parse the SMILES again. The part CCC1(CC) would be a cyclohexane where one carbon has two methyl groups (CCC1 and CC), but that's probably a branching point. Then the C(=O)N is attached to the ring, followed by COC(=O)c2ccccc2 as a substituent on the N. Then the C1 connects to S(=O)(=O)c3ccccc3. So the central ring is the cyclohexane (C1...C1), connected via a sulfur atom to a benzene ring. The nitrogen is part of the cyclohexane ring? Or is the ring a six-membered ring including the nitrogen?\n\nWait, maybe the cyclohexane is part of a ring that includes the nitrogen and sulfur. Let me think. The SMILES is CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(...)C1S(...). The C1 is the starting point. The sequence is C-C-C-1, then (CC), so that's a branch. Then C(=O)N(...) which is connected back to C1. Then the S part is attached to C1. So the ring structure here would be a six-membered ring: positions are C1, then C (from C(=O)), then N, then another C (from the C1S part), then S, and back? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the ring is formed by C1 connected to the nitrogen and sulfur. Wait, the SMILES notation can be tricky. Let me try to draw it out mentally.\n\nThe main ring structure is likely a six-membered ring formed by the atoms connected via C1. The sequence starts with CCC1(CC), meaning that the first three carbons (CCC) are connected to C1, which has a branch (CC). Then, after that, there's a C(=O)N group, then the C1 is connected again to S. So the ring would be C1 connected to the C(=O)N, then through another carbon (from C1S...), making a ring? Maybe a five-membered ring? Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridged system. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Murcko scaffold here would be the central ring system. Let's focus on the rings. The input has two benzene rings (c2ccccc2 and c3ccccc3) and possibly a cyclohexane or another ring. The key is to retain all ring systems and the connecting bonds. So, the two benzene rings are part of the scaffold. The connecting structure between them is the sulfur with sulfonyl groups. Wait, the S(=O)(=O) connects the central ring (maybe a six-membered ring) to the benzene. So the scaffold would include the central ring (if it's a ring), the sulfonyl group as a connecting bond, and the benzene. Also, the other benzene (c2ccccc2) is part of an ester group, which is a side chain, so it's removed.\n\nWait, the SMILES has two benzene rings: one is c2ccccc2 attached via OCO to the N, and the other is c3ccccc3 attached via S(=O)(=O). The central part is the cyclohexane ring with the N and S. So the Murcko scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring (without substituents like CCC, CC) connected via S(=O)(=O) to the benzene. Also, the N is part of the ring, so any substituents on N (like the COC(=O)c2...) would be removed. So stripping all substituents, the scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring connected via sulfonyl to the benzene. But wait, is the cyclohexane part of a ring with the N and S? Or is it a separate ring?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central structure is a bicyclic system. Let me parse the SMILES again: CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(COC(=O)c2ccccc2)C1S(=O)(=O)c3ccccc3. The C1 is part of a ring. The atoms in the ring would be C1, then C (from C(=O)), then N, then C (from C1S...), then S, then maybe another C? Wait, perhaps the ring is C1 connected to C (from C(=O)), then N, then the next C (from C1S...), forming a four-membered ring? That seems unlikely. Maybe it's a five-membered ring. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central ring is a six-membered ring. Let's see: starting at C1, then CCC1 would imply a cyclohexane? Wait, no. The CCC1(CC) suggests that C1 has three substituents: CCC, CC, and then the rest. Wait, perhaps the ring is C1 connected to two carbons (from the branches) and then the other atoms. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should use a tool to parse the SMILES, but since I can't, I'll proceed logically.\n\nThe key is to identify all rings in the structure. The benzene rings are obvious. Then, the central part must form a ring. The SMILES has C1...C1, which indicates a ring closure. The part between the two C1s is C(=O)N(COC(...))C1S(...). So the ring is formed by C1 connected via C-C(=O)-N-C-S(=O)(=O)-... back to C1? That would make a 5-membered ring: C1, C, O, N, C, S, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the ring is C1-C-C(=O)-N-C-S(=O)(=O)-C1? That would be a six-membered ring: C1, C, C(=O), N, C, S, back to C1. But that doesn't add up. Maybe the ring is smaller. Alternatively, maybe the ring is formed by C1 connected to a carbon, which is connected to the C=O, then the N, then another carbon connected back to C1. So C1-C-C(=O)-N-C1? That would make a five-membered ring. But then where is the S?\n\nWait, the SMILES is CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(COC...)C1S... So after the N, there's a COC group, then the C1 is connected to S. So the ring would be C1 connected to C (from C(=O)), then N, then the COC is a substituent on N, then the next atom is C1 connected to S. So the ring would be C1-C-C(=O)-N-C1, forming a five-membered ring. Then the S is connected to C1, along with the other substituents. So the core scaffold would include this five-membered ring (C1-C-C(=O)-N-C1), the S(=O)(=O) connected to C1, and the benzene ring connected to S. But wait, the C=O and N are part of the ring. According to Murcko, functional groups like C=O on the ring would be retained if they're part of the ring system. Wait, no. Murcko removes functional groups. Wait, the definition says to remove functional groups, leaving only the ring systems and connecting bonds. So maybe the C=O in the ring would be considered part of the connecting bonds or part of the ring structure. Wait, the Murcko scaffold retains the ring systems and the connecting bonds between them. Functional groups attached to the rings (like substituents) are removed. But if the C=O is part of the ring itself (like in a lactam), then it's part of the ring system and stays. So in this case, if the ring includes the C=O and N, then those atoms are part of the ring system and stay. The sulfonyl group is a connecting bond between the five-membered ring and the benzene. So the scaffold would be the five-membered ring (including the C=O and N) connected via S(=O)(=O) to the benzene. Then, the other benzene (from the ester) is a side chain and removed. Also, the substituents on the five-membered ring (like CCC and CC) are removed. So the final scaffold would be the five-membered ring (without substituents) connected via sulfonyl to the benzene. But how to represent that in SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the five-membered ring is part of a larger ring system. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the central ring is a six-membered ring. Let's try again. The SMILES is CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(...)C1S(...). So the ring closure is between the first C1 and the last C1 in that part. So the atoms in the ring would be C1, then C (from CCC1), then C (from CC branch?), then C(=O), N, and back to C1. Wait, that would be a five-membered ring: C1-C-C-C(=O)-N-C1. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the ring includes the S. The S is attached to C1, so maybe the ring is C1 connected to S and other atoms. This is getting too ambiguous without visualizing.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the process. To get the Murcko scaffold, we need to:\n\n1. Remove all side chains and functional groups, keeping rings and linkers.\n\nSo first, identify all rings. The benzene rings are definitely kept. Then, the central rings. The input has a sulfur connecting to a benzene. The central part is a ring (due to C1...C1). That ring is part of the scaffold. So the central ring (probably a five- or six-membered ring including N and S) is kept. The substituents like CCC, CC, COC(=O)... are all removed. The sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) is a linker between the central ring and the benzene, so it's kept. The other benzene (from the ester) is a side chain and removed.\n\nSo the scaffold would be the central ring (without substituents) connected via S(=O)(=O) to the benzene. The central ring might be, for example, a thiazine or similar. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)C2CC(=O)NCC2. Wait, but how is the central ring structured? Let's try to reconstruct.\n\nAssuming the central ring is a five-membered ring: C1 connected to C, which is connected to C(=O), then N, then back to C1. So the ring would be C1-C-C(=O)-N-C1. But that's a five-membered ring. Then S is attached to C1. So the SMILES would be C1C(=O)NCC1S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2. But the original has CCC1(CC)... which are substituents. So after removing substituents, the ring is C1C-C(=O)-N-C1, but that's not correct. Alternatively, the central ring is a six-membered ring. Maybe C1-C-C-C(=O)-N-C1, making a six-membered ring. Then S is attached to C1. So the SMILES would be C1CC(=O)NCC1S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ring is a thiazolidine or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is the benzene ring connected via sulfonyl to a central ring which is a cyclohexane with an amide group as part of the ring. But I'm not certain.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to remove all substituents except the rings and the connecting atoms. The input has two benzene rings. The central structure has a ring (from C1...C1) which includes an amide group (C(=O)N) and a sulfonyl group connecting to the benzene. So the scaffold would be the central ring (without substituents) connected via S(=O)(=O) to the benzene. The other benzene (from the ester) is removed. The central ring would be, for example, a six-membered ring with an amide and sulfur.\n\nBut to represent this in SMILES, perhaps it's something like C1CC(=O)N(SO2c2ccccc2)CC1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the central ring might be a five-membered ring with S. For example, C1C(=O)NCS1(=O)=O)c2ccccc2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)C2CC(=O)NCC2. But I'm not confident. Maybe the correct SMILES is O=C1N(CC1)S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2. Because the central ring is a four-membered ring? No, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the original SMILES has CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(...)C1S..., the ring closure is between the first C1 and the last C1. So the atoms in the ring are C1, then C (from CCC1), which branches into CC, then C(=O), then N, then C (from C1S...), then back to C1. So the ring would be C1-C-C(=O)-N-C-C1. That would make a five-membered ring: C1 connected to C (with branches), then C(=O), N, C, back to C1. Wait, but where is the C in C1S...? Maybe the ring is C1-C-C(=O)-N-C-S-C1? No, that's a six-membered ring. But the S is attached to C1, so the ring would be C1-C-C(=O)-N-C-C1 with S attached to C1. Then the S has the sulfonyl groups and the benzene.\n\nSo the scaffold would be the five-membered ring (C1-C-C(=O)-N-C-C1) connected to S(=O)(=O)-benzene. But the C=O and N are part of the ring, so they stay. Wait, according to the definition, functional groups are removed, but if they're part of the ring system, they stay. So the C=O and N in the ring are part of the scaffold. The substituents like CCC and CC on the ring are removed. So the scaffold would be C1CC(=O)NCC1S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2. But I'm not sure if that's the correct SMILES. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is a six-membered ring with the S outside. This is quite challenging without visualizing the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use a tool like RDKit to perform the Murcko decomposition. But since I can't do that here, I'll proceed with the best guess.\n\nThe final answer would be the benzene ring connected via sulfonyl to a central ring (likely a five- or six-membered ring including N and C=O), with all substituents removed. So the SMILES would be something like C1CC(=O)NCC1S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2. But checking valency: the sulfonyl is S(=O)(=O), connected to the benzene and the central ring. The central ring's SMILES would be C1CC(=O)NCC1, making a six-membered ring. So combining: C1CC(=O)NCC1S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2. That seems plausible. Let me check the original SMILES: the S is attached to C1. So in the original, the C1 is part of the ring and connected to S. So yes, the SMILES would have the ring connected to S. So the scaffold would be that ring plus the sulfonyl and benzene. Therefore, the correct SMILES is O=C1N(CCCC1)S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe C1C(C(=O)NCC1)S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2. Hmm. This is getting too uncertain. Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the best possible answer based on the analysis.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to find the Murcko scaffold for the given SMILES: O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1. Let me start by breaking down the structure. The molecule has two benzene rings. The first one is connected via a chain that includes NC(=S)NC. The second benzene ring has a nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]). \n\nAccording to the definition, the Murcko scaffold removes all side chains and functional groups, keeping only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So, I should remove the nitro group from the second benzene ring. Then, look at the first part: the benzene ring (c1ccco1) is part of a side chain connected to the main structure via NC. Wait, maybe the main scaffold is the two benzene rings connected by the central carbonyl group (C=O). Let me visualize this.\n\nThe original SMILES is O=C(NC(=S)NCc2ccco2)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1. The main framework would be the two benzene rings connected by the C=O. The side chains like NC(=S)NCc2ccco2 and the nitro group on the second benzene ring should be removed. So stripping those, the scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by the carbonyl. The connecting bonds are the single bonds from the carbonyl to each benzene. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold is O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2. Wait, but in the original structure, the rings might be different. Let me check again. The first ring is c1ccco1, which is a five-membered ring (since o is oxygen), so that's a furan or similar. Wait, no, in SMILES notation, 'o' is oxygen. So c1ccco1 is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one oxygen. But the Murcko scaffold includes all ring systems, so the oxygen is part of the ring. However, the NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 is a side chain attached to the central carbonyl. Wait, the central part is O=C(N...)c1ccc(...)cc1. So the main rings are the benzene (from c1ccc(...)cc1) and the five-membered ring (c1ccco1) connected via the NC(=S)N-C chain? No, wait, the central carbonyl is connected to two benzene rings? Or is the structure different?\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the SMILES more carefully. The SMILES is O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2. The central atom is the C=O. The left side is NC(=S)NCc1ccco1, which is a chain leading to a five-membered ring (c1ccco1, which is a furan-like ring but with four carbons and one oxygen). The right side is c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2, a benzene ring with a nitro group. So the main scaffold would be the two aromatic rings connected through the central carbonyl group. But wait, the left side's five-membered ring is connected via a chain (NC(=S)NC-). Since the Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and keeping rings and connecting bonds, perhaps the five-membered ring (c1ccco1) is a side chain off the main structure. Wait, maybe the main rings are the benzene on the right and the five-membered ring on the left, connected via the central carbonyl and the adjacent nitrogen? Or is the five-membered ring part of a side chain?\n\nHmm. The definition says to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. The Murcko scaffold is the ring systems plus the linkers between them. So any non-ring atoms that are part of connecting the rings are kept. So if there's a chain that connects two rings, that chain's atoms are part of the scaffold. But if the chain is a substituent (like a branch off a ring), then it's removed. In this case, the central carbonyl (O=C) is connected to two parts: one is the NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 and the other is the benzene ring with nitro. Let's see: the NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 is a substituent on the carbonyl. So that substituent includes a chain (N-C(=S)-N-C-) leading to the five-membered ring. Since the NC(=S)NCC is a chain leading to a ring, perhaps that entire chain is a side chain, so it's removed. Similarly, the nitro group on the benzene is a substituent, so removed. Therefore, the main scaffold would be the central carbonyl connected to two benzene rings? Wait, but the left side is connected via N-C(=S)-N-C- to the five-membered ring. Wait, maybe the left side's ring is the five-membered (c1ccco1), connected via a chain (C-N-C(=S)-N-) to the carbonyl. Since the chain is not part of a ring, it's a side chain. So removing that, the left side would just be the carbonyl connected to a benzene (the right side). Wait, the right side is a benzene ring attached to the carbonyl. The left side's substituent is the NC(=S)NCc1ccco1, which is a side chain. So removing that, the Murcko scaffold would be the benzene ring (from the right side) connected via the carbonyl group. But what about the left side's substituent? If the left substituent is a chain leading to another ring, maybe that ring (five-membered) is part of the scaffold if the connecting chain is considered a linker. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try drawing it.\n\nThe molecule structure: central carbonyl (C=O) connected to an amine (N) which is connected to a thiocarbonyl (C=S), then another amine (N), then a methylene (C) connected to a five-membered ring (c1ccco1). On the other side of the carbonyl is a benzene ring with a nitro group. So the main rings would be the five-membered (c1ccco1) and the benzene ring (c2ccc...). The connecting chain between them is the N-C(=S)-N-C- bridge. But wait, are those atoms part of the linker between rings? If so, then the Murcko scaffold would include those atoms as the connecting bonds. But the definition says to leave only the ring systems and connecting bonds. So the rings are the five-membered and the benzene, connected via the N-C(=S)-N-C- chain. But that chain is not part of a ring, so perhaps it's considered a linker. Wait, but the Murcko scaffold typically includes the rings and the linkers (the atoms connecting the rings). So in this case, the two rings (five-membered and benzene) are connected via the N-C(=S)-N-C- linker. But that's four atoms in the linker. However, the nitro group on the benzene is a substituent and should be removed. Similarly, any substituents on the five-membered ring? The five-membered ring is c1ccco1, which is O in the ring, so no substituents except the connecting chain. So the Murcko scaffold would be the five-membered ring connected via the N-C(=S)-N-C- linker to the benzene ring, but without the nitro group. Wait, but the original input's right benzene ring has a nitro group, which is a substituent, so that's removed. So the benzene ring would be without the nitro. But the left five-membered ring is part of the scaffold? Or is the five-membered ring part of a side chain?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The central carbonyl is connected to two substituents: one is the NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 and the other is the benzene ring. So the main structure is the benzene ring attached to the carbonyl, and the NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 is a substituent on the carbonyl's nitrogen. That substituent includes a chain leading to the five-membered ring. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would only include the benzene ring connected via the carbonyl to the nitrogen (if that's part of a ring system). Wait, but the carbonyl is O=C(N...), so the nitrogen is part of the substituent. Therefore, the main scaffold would just be the benzene ring (from the right side) connected via the carbonyl to nothing else, because the left side's substituent is a chain leading to another ring but that's considered a side chain. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire structure is a central ring system. Wait, perhaps the main rings are the benzene and the five-membered ring connected via a linker. Let me check an example. If the molecule is like benzene-C(=O)-N-C(=S)-N-CH2-furan, then the Murcko scaffold would be benzene connected via the linker (C(=O)-N-C(=S)-N-CH2) to the furan. But that's a long linker. But according to the definition, the Murcko scaffold includes the rings and the connecting bonds. So the linker is part of the scaffold. But wait, the connecting bonds are the bonds that are between the rings. So any atoms that are in the path connecting two rings are part of the scaffold. So in this case, the linker between the benzene and the furan would be part of the scaffold. So the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via the linker (C(=O)-N-C(=S)-N-CH2-) to the furan ring. But that seems complex. However, in practice, Murcko scaffolds often simplify to the ring systems and the direct connecting bonds. For example, if two rings are connected by a single bond, that's included. If there's a chain of atoms between rings, those are considered part of the scaffold. So in this case, the linker is part of the scaffold.\n\nBut wait, the nitro group on the benzene is a substituent, so that's removed. Similarly, any substituents on the furan? The furan here is part of the ring, so the oxygen is part of the ring. So the scaffold would include the benzene (without nitro), the furan, and the connecting linker. But the connecting linker in the input is NC(=S)NCc. So the linker is N-C(=S)-N-C- connecting the carbonyl to the furan. Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the central C=O connected to the benzene. So the entire structure would be benzene-C(=O)-N-C(=S)-N-C-furan. That would be the scaffold. So the SMILES would be O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c2ccccc2. But wait, the original benzene on the right side is c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2, so after removing the nitro, it's c2ccccc2 (benzene). The furan is c1ccco1. So the scaffold is O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c2ccccc2. But is that correct? Or should the NC(=S)NCc part be considered a side chain and removed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main scaffold is just the benzene ring connected via the carbonyl to the nitrogen, but then the rest is a side chain. But that would leave just benzene-C(=O)-N, which isn't a ring. Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of another approach. The Murcko scaffold is derived by iteratively removing terminal non-ring atoms and converting exocyclic double bonds to single bonds. So, starting with the original structure, we need to prune all the side chains until only the ring systems and the connecting atoms remain. Let's apply that step by step.\n\nOriginal structure: Benzene ring (right) with nitro group attached, connected via carbonyl (C=O) to an N which is connected to C(=S)N... etc., leading to a furan ring. The nitro group is a substituent on the benzene, so remove that. Then, the benzene is connected via C=O to N. The N is connected to C(=S), which is connected to another N, then a CH2, then the furan. Are those atoms (N-C(=S)-N-CH2-) part of a chain connecting two rings (benzene and furan)? If so, they form the linker between the two rings and are part of the scaffold. Therefore, the scaffold would be benzene-C(=O)-N-C(=S)-N-CH2-furan. But the furan is a five-membered ring with oxygen. So the SMILES would be O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c2ccccc2. However, the nitro group is removed from the benzene. But wait, the original benzene on the right has the nitro group, so after removal, it's just benzene (c2ccccc2). The left side's furan is connected via the chain. So the SMILES would be O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c2ccccc2. But does the Murcko scaffold retain the linker between the two rings? Yes, according to the definition. So the answer would be that scaffold. However, I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: use a tool like RDKit to perform the Murcko scaffold extraction. But since I can't do that here, I have to reason it out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central part is the benzene and the furan connected via the carbonyl and the other atoms. But I'm not sure. Another way: in the input SMILES, the two rings are the benzene (right) and the furan (left). The connecting path between them is through the carbonyl, then N-C(=S)-N-CH2-. So the scaffold includes those connecting atoms. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold is O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c2ccccc2. But wait, the nitro group is gone. So yes, that's the correct scaffold. But I'm still not 100% confident. Alternatively, perhaps the linker is considered too long, but the definition doesn't specify a limit on linker length. So I think the correct answer is the two rings connected via the carbonyl and the N-C(=S)-N-CH2- linker.",

The molecule has two rings: a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) and a cyclohexane-like ring (C1CCN...CC1). The benzene is attached via a methylene group (Cc2...), which is an exocyclic bond. The side chains like CC(C)C(=O)NC... should be removed. The connecting bond between the two rings is the N-C link. Wait, but the cyclohexane ring has a nitrogen. The Murcko scaffold includes rings and the bonds that connect them. So, remove the side chains: the isopropyl group (CC(C)), the carbonyl (C=O), and the methylene group (C) attached to the benzene. The benzene ring and the cyclohexane (with the N) connected by the bond from N to the cyclohexane's C. Wait, the structure is NC1CCN(...)CC1. The benzene is connected via the N's substituent. So the rings are the cyclohexane (with N in the ring) and the benzene. The connecting bond is the N-C between the cyclohexane and the benzene's methylene. But since the methylene is exocyclic to the benzene, that part gets removed. So the scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring (as N1CCN...CC1) connected directly to the benzene. Wait, but the original connection is N-C-c2ccccc2. The C here is part of the side chain. So removing that, the benzene is connected via the N? Or is the benzene part of the scaffold? No, because the benzene is connected via a single bond (exocyclic). So the Murcko scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring with the N in the ring, but without the benzene? Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me draw it out.\n\nThe molecule is CC(C)C(=O)NC1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)CC1. The main chain is NC1CCN(...)CC1. The N in the cyclohexane ring has a substituent: Cc2ccccc2 (benzene attached via CH2). The other substituent is the amide group CC(C)C(=O). The Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains. So the rings are the cyclohexane (with N in the ring) and the benzene. The connecting bond is the one between the cyclohexane N and the CH2-benzene. But since the CH2 is exocyclic, it's removed. Therefore, the scaffold should be the cyclohexane ring connected to the benzene ring via a single bond? Or wait, no\u2014because the benzene is attached via a single bond (CH2), which is an exocyclic bond. Therefore, the benzene is a side chain and should be removed. So the scaffold would just be the cyclohexane ring with the N in the ring. But wait, the connecting bonds between rings are kept. If there are two rings connected, but in this case, the benzene is connected via a non-ring bond. So maybe the Murcko scaffold is the cyclohexane ring plus the benzene only if they are fused or connected by a bridge. But here, the benzene is a substituent via a single bond. Therefore, the scaffold is the cyclohexane ring with the N, but without the benzene. Wait, but maybe the connecting bonds between rings are kept. The problem is that the benzene is a separate ring system connected via a linker (CH2), which is considered a side chain. So the correct scaffold would be the cyclohexane (with the N in the ring) as one ring, but the benzene is another ring connected via the CH2, which is a linker. Wait, the Murcko scaffold definition says to leave ring systems and connecting bonds. So if there are two rings connected by a bond (not via a chain), then they are part of the scaffold. But if they are connected via a chain (like CH2), that chain is removed. So in this case, the benzene is connected via a CH2 to the cyclohexane's N. That CH2 is a single bond, so it's a side chain. Therefore, the scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring (with the N) and the benzene ring connected directly? No, because the CH2 is part of the side chain. Therefore, the benzene is a side chain and is removed. So the scaffold is the cyclohexane ring with the N. But wait, the connecting bonds between rings are kept. If the two rings are connected via a single bond (without any atoms in between), then they are part of the scaffold. In this case, the benzene is connected via a CH2, which is not part of a ring. So the CH2 is a side chain. Therefore, the scaffold is the cyclohexane ring (with the N) and the benzene is removed. Wait, but maybe the cyclohexane is part of a larger ring system. Let me check again. The core structure is the cyclohexane ring (C1CCN...CC1), where the N is part of the ring. The substituents on the N are the CH2-benzene and the amide group. Both are side chains. So removing all substituents, the scaffold is the cyclohexane ring with the N in the ring. But then, the benzene is a separate ring. Wait, but the benzene isn't part of any ring system connected to the cyclohexane. So the Murcko scaffold would just be the cyclohexane ring. But maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the N in the cyclohexane has a connecting bond to the benzene, but since it's through a CH2, that's a side chain. Therefore, the correct scaffold is the cyclohexane ring with the N, and the benzene is removed. Wait, but the example in the definition includes rings connected by a bond. For example, biphenyl would have two benzene rings connected by a single bond as the scaffold. So if two rings are connected directly, they are kept. But if connected via a chain, the chain is removed. In this case, the benzene is connected via a CH2 (which is a chain), so the benzene is a side chain. Therefore, the scaffold is just the cyclohexane ring. But wait, the cyclohexane ring has an N in it. So the scaffold would be N1CCNCC1? No, that's not a ring. Wait, the SMILES for the cyclohexane with an N would be C1CCNCC1. Wait, the original SMILES has NC1CCN(...)CC1. The cyclohexane ring is C1CCN(...)CC1. Wait, but the nitrogen is in the ring. So the ring is a six-membered ring with one N atom. So the scaffold is that ring. So the SMILES would be C1CCNCC1. But the original input has C1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)CC1. The (Cc2ccccc2) is a substituent on the N. So removing that substituent, the scaffold is C1CCNCC1. But wait, the other substituent on the N is the amide group (NC(=O)C(C)C). So removing all substituents, the ring is C1CCNCC1. So the output SMILES should be C1CCNCC1. But wait, let me verify. The original SMILES is CC(C)C(=O)NC1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)CC1. The main chain is the cyclohexane ring (C1CCN...CC1). The N in the ring has two substituents: the amide group (NC(=O)C(C)C) and the benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2). Both are side chains. So removing all side chains, the scaffold is the ring system, which is the cyclohexane with the N. So the SMILES is C1CCNCC1. Let me confirm. The Murcko scaffold removes all side chains, leaving rings and connecting bonds. Here, the only ring is the cyclohexane with N. The benzene is a side chain. So the scaffold is C1CCNCC1. Yes.",

First, I need to identify the ring systems and the connecting bonds.\n\nLooking at the structure, there's a piperidine ring (C1CCCN1) attached via an amide group (NC(=O)). Then there's another part with a sugar-like structure: C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. This has two connected rings, maybe a bicyclic system.\n\nMurcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and functional groups. So the ester groups (OCOEt, OCOC) and the hydroxyl groups (OC) should be stripped. The amide link (NC(=O)) is a side chain, so that's removed too. The rings to keep are the piperidine and the bicyclic rings. The connecting bond between them is the single bond from the central CC. Wait, the central part is CC(N...), so the connecting bond might be between the piperidine and the bicyclic system via the central carbon chain. But after removing side chains, the scaffold would be the two rings connected by a single bond. Let me check: the original molecule has the piperidine connected via an amide to the central carbon, which is connected to the bicyclic ring via an ether or something. After removing all substituents, the rings should remain connected by the bonds that were part of the original ring system connections. Maybe the central chain is gone, leaving the two rings connected by a bond? Or perhaps the connecting bridge between the two rings is part of the scaffold. Hmm, I might need to draw this out mentally. The piperidine (6-membered N-containing ring) and the bicyclic system (maybe a dioxane or similar) connected via a single bond from the central chain. But when removing side chains, the connecting bond would be the one that's part of the ring linkage. Wait, perhaps the actual scaffold is the individual rings without any connecting bonds. No, the Murcko scaffold includes the rings and the connecting bonds. So any bonds that bridge rings or connect them are kept. So in this case, the central part might have a chain that connects the two ring systems. After removing substituents, the connecting chain might be reduced to a single bond. Wait, the original structure is CCOC(=O)CC(...), so the central CC is part of the main chain. The side chains are the ester (OCOEt) and the amide (NC(=O)). Removing those, the main chain would be the CC connecting the two rings. So the scaffold would be the two rings (piperidine and the bicyclic) connected by a two-carbon chain. But wait, the Murcko scaffold typically retains the ring systems and the connecting bonds, but not aliphatic chains unless they are part of a bridge. Wait, perhaps the connecting bonds are only the bonds that are part of the ring systems. Wait, the definition says \"ring systems and connecting bonds\". So the connecting bonds are those that link the rings together. For example, if two rings are connected by a single bond, that's kept. If they're connected via a chain, that chain is reduced to the minimal connecting path. But I think in Murcko's method, all side chains are removed, so any aliphatic chains between rings are pruned to just the bonds necessary to connect the rings. So in this case, between the piperidine and the bicyclic ring, there's a CC chain. But removing side chains would leave just the rings. Wait, maybe the actual connecting bond is part of a bridge. Let me re-examine the input. The part after the central CC is NC(=O)C1CCCN1, which is the piperidine attached via an amide. Then the other branch is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC, which is a bicyclic ether system. The main chain is CC connected to both rings via substituents. So the Murcko scaffold would retain the rings and any bonds connecting them. However, the amide and ester groups are functional groups, so they are removed. The central CC is part of the main chain but not a ring, so it's considered a side chain? Wait, maybe not. If the main chain is part of the core structure linking the rings, then it's kept. But according to the definition, only ring systems and connecting bonds are retained. Connecting bonds are the bonds that are part of the framework connecting the rings. So, if there's a chain between two rings, that chain is considered part of the scaffold only if it's necessary to connect the rings. But typically, in Murcko scaffolds, the connecting bonds are single bonds directly between rings or via a bridge. For example, if two rings are connected by a single bond, that's kept. If they're connected via a chain, like -CH2-CH2-, that chain is removed, and the rings are considered separate. Wait, no. The Murcko scaffold includes all rings and the connecting atoms between them. So, for example, in a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2-benzene, the Murcko scaffold would be benzene-benzene connected by a single bond if the chain is considered a side chain. Wait, no. The actual process involves converting the molecule into its framework by removing all atoms that are not in rings or part of the linker between rings. Linkers are defined as chains of atoms connecting two rings. So, in the case of benzene-CH2-CH2-benzene, the scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by a two-carbon chain. But the Murcko scaffold definition says that the linker is the minimal chain connecting rings. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: the Murcko scaffold is the union of all rings and the linker atoms that connect them. So any atoms that are part of a chain connecting two rings are considered part of the scaffold. So in the case of a chain like -CH2-CH2- between two rings, those two carbons are part of the scaffold. But if the chain has branches, those branches are removed. So in the input molecule, the central part is CC (from the SMILES: CC(NC(=O)...)C1...). So the CC is between the two substituents (the piperidine and the bicyclic ring). Therefore, the scaffold would include the two rings connected by the two carbons. Wait, but if those carbons are part of the linker between the rings, then they are included. However, in the original molecule, the central CC is connected to an ester group (OCOEt) and an amide (NC(=O)). So when we remove the side chains (ester and amide groups), the CC remains as the linker between the two rings. Therefore, the scaffold would be the piperidine ring connected via CC to the bicyclic ring. But wait, the bicyclic ring in the SMILES is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. Let me parse that. It's a sugar-like structure with two oxygen atoms. The core is a six-membered ring (C1O...O...C1) and another ring (C2O...O...C2). So perhaps it's a fused or bridged ring system. The exact structure might be a dioxane or similar. Regardless, it's a ring system. So the scaffold would be the piperidine (C1CCCN1) connected via the CC linker to the bicyclic ring (C1OC2...). Wait, but the CC is part of the main chain. So the Murcko scaffold would be the two rings connected by the two carbons. However, I need to check if those carbons are part of the linker. Alternatively, maybe the central CC is part of a larger ring. No, the original SMILES doesn't indicate that. So the final scaffold would be the piperidine ring and the bicyclic ring connected by a two-carbon chain. But let me verify: the input's SMILES is CCOC(=O)CC(NC(=O)C1CCCN1)C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. Breaking it down: the central CC is connected to an ester group (OCOEt), an amide (NC(=O)piperidine), and the bicyclic ring (C1OC2...). So when we remove the ester and amide groups, the remaining structure is CC connected to the bicyclic ring. But the piperidine is attached via the amide, which is a side chain. So removing the amide (NC(=O)), the piperidine would be disconnected. Wait, no. The NC(=O) is part of the side chain. The piperidine is attached via the amide group. So when we remove the amide (side chain), the piperidine is no longer connected. Therefore, the scaffold would only include the bicyclic ring and any connecting atoms that are part of the core. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use a tool or algorithm to do this properly, but since I'm doing it manually... Let's try again. The Murcko scaffold is rings plus the connecting bonds. All functional groups and side chains are removed. So, starting with the input molecule, identify all rings. Piperidine (6-membered with N), the bicyclic system (possibly a bridged or fused ring), and any other rings. Then, the connecting bonds between these rings. Any atoms that are not part of a ring or a connecting bond are removed. So, the ester groups (OCOEt) are side chains, so removed. The amide group (NC(=O)) is a side chain, so removed. The central part is CC connected to the bicyclic ring. If the CC is part of a chain connecting two rings (piperidine and bicyclic), but after removing the amide, the piperidine is no longer connected. Wait, maybe the piperidine is a side chain off the central CC. So removing it leaves the CC connected to the bicyclic ring. But then, is the CC considered a linker? If there's only one ring (the bicyclic), then the scaffold is just that. But if there's another ring connected via a linker, then both rings and the linker are kept. Wait, the original molecule has the piperidine attached via an amide to the central CC. So the piperidine is a side chain off the central carbon. Therefore, when we remove side chains, the piperidine is removed, leaving the central CC connected to the bicyclic ring. But the central CC is part of the main chain. However, if there's only one ring (the bicyclic), then the scaffold is that ring. But perhaps there's another ring. Wait, the piperidine is a ring, but it's attached as a side chain. So the core structure is the bicyclic ring plus any connecting atoms. Alternatively, maybe the central CC is part of the linker between two rings. But without the piperidine, the scaffold would only include the bicyclic ring. Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to draw the structure mentally. The main chain is CCOC(=O)-CC-... The CC is connected to three groups: OCOEt (ester), NC(=O)piperidine (amide), and the bicyclic ring. Removing the ester and amide groups, the CC is connected only to the bicyclic ring. So the remaining structure is CC connected to the bicyclic ring. But that's a two-carbon chain attached to the ring. Since those carbons are not part of a ring themselves, they would be considered side chains and removed. Therefore, the scaffold is just the bicyclic ring. But wait, maybe the bicyclic ring has substituents. Looking at the SMILES for the bicyclic part: C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. This forms a ring where C1 is connected to O, then C2, which is part of another ring. Breaking it down: C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1-O-C. Wait, perhaps it's a bridged system. For example, a 1,4-dioxane ring fused with another ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a tricyclic system. Regardless, it's a ring system. So the scaffold would be this bicyclic or tricyclic ring. The piperidine is a side chain, so removed. The central CC and the ester/amide groups are also removed. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold is just the bicyclic ring. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe there's another ring. Let me count the ring closures. In C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC, the C1 is part of a ring closure (C1...C1), and C2 is part of another closure (C2...C2). So it's two separate rings? Or a bridged system? For example, C1 is connected to O, then to C2, which is part of a ring. So maybe it's a spiro ring or a bridged system. Either way, it's a ring system. So the Murcko scaffold would be that ring system. Therefore, the final answer is the SMILES for that bicyclic ring. But how to write that? Let's reconstruct the SMILES without the substituents. The original part is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. The OC at the end is an oxygen connected to a carbon, which is a substituent. Removing substituents (the (C)(C) part), but wait, in the SMILES, OC(C)(C) is a tert-butoxy group? Wait, the part OC2OC(C)(C)OC2: the C2 is part of a ring. So the structure is O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2. So the C2 is connected to three oxygens? No, the SMILES is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. Let me parse it step by step:\n\nStarting from C1: C1 is connected to O, then to C2. C2 is part of a ring: O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2, forming a ring. Then back to C1 via O and C1. So the entire structure is a ring where C1 is connected to O, C2 (which is in a three-membered ring? No, the C2 is part of a ring: C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2, making a 5-membered ring? Wait, C2 is connected to O, then to C(C)(C), then to O, then back to C2. That would be a 4-membered ring: C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2. But that's a four-membered ring with two oxygens. Then the C1 is connected to O, then to C2 (which is part of this four-membered ring), then O, then back to C1. So C1 is part of another ring: C1-O-C2-O... etc., forming a larger ring. This seems like a bridged or fused ring system. Regardless, the SMILES represents a complex ring system. To get the Murcko scaffold, we need to remove all substituents. The C(C)(C) in OC(C)(C) is a tert-butyl group attached to the oxygen. Since that's a substituent, it should be removed. So the OC(C)(C) becomes O. Therefore, the ring system would be C1OC2OCOC2C1O. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let's try to remove the substituents. The original part is OC2OC(C)(C)OC2. The OC(C)(C) is a substituent on the oxygen. Removing that, the structure becomes OC2OOC2. But that's not possible. Alternatively, the C(C)(C) is a branch off the oxygen. So removing that branch leaves the oxygen connected only to C2. So the corrected SMILES for the ring would be C1OC2OOC2C1O. But that might form a different ring system. However, perhaps the correct approach is to remove all atoms that are not part of the ring system or connecting bonds. The tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)) is a substituent, so it's removed. The oxygen atoms that are part of the rings are kept. So the resulting scaffold for the bicyclic part would be C1OC2OOC2C1O. Wait, but that might not form valid rings. Let me count the atoms. For the C2 ring: C2-O-C-O-C2. That's a four-membered ring: C2, O, C, O. But the middle C is from the C(C)(C) which was removed. So without that, the ring becomes C2-O-O-C2, which is invalid. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the C(C)(C) is part of a bridge. If the original structure is a bridged system, removing the bridge would break the ring. Wait, this is getting too complicated without drawing it. Maybe the correct scaffold is the bicyclic ring without the tert-butyl groups. So the SMILES would be C1OC2OC(OC2C1O)CO. No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the core rings connected without substituents. Let me think differently. The original SMILES for the bicyclic part is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. The OC at the end is another oxygen and carbon, which might be a substituent. So removing all substituents (the (C)(C) and the terminal OC), the core would be C1OC2OCO C2C1O. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is C1OC2OCCOC2C1O. Wait, but I'm not sure. This is getting too ambiguous. Perhaps I should look for the rings and connecting bonds. The main rings are the piperidine and the bicyclic system. But since the piperidine is attached via a side chain (amide), it's removed. The bicyclic system, after removing substituents (like the tert-butyl and any other side chains), becomes a core ring system. The exact SMILES would depend on that. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is the bicyclic ring without the substituents, which would be C1OC2OCOC2C1O. But I'm not confident. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the Murcko scaffold is the bicyclic ring system with the tert-butyl groups and other substituents removed. Therefore, the SMILES would be O1C2OC(COC2C1)CO. No, perhaps the correct scaffold is C1OC2OCCOC2C1O. Alternatively, maybe it's a fused dioxane and another ring. Given the complexity, I might have to settle on the original bicyclic part without the substituents, resulting in a SMILES like C1OC2OCOC2C1O. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the entire bicyclic system as is, including the oxygen atoms but without the substituents. Wait, the OC(C)(C) is a substituent, so removing that gives OC2OC... but that breaks the ring. Therefore, perhaps the original bicyclic system remains intact except for the substituents. So the scaffold would be C1OC2OCOC2C1O. However, this is speculative. In practice, using a tool like RDKit would be better, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll have to make a best guess. The final answer is the SMILES of the bicyclic ring system without the substituents, which would be O1C2OC(COC2C1)CO. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is the bicyclic system with the substituent oxygens but without the tert-butyl groups. So the SMILES becomes C1OC2OC(OC2C1O)CO. Hmm. This is challenging. Perhaps the correct answer is the bicyclic ring system represented by C1OC2OCCOC2C1O. Alternatively, it's a mistake, and the actual scaffold is different. Given the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the Murcko scaffold is the bicyclic ring system without the substituents, leading to a SMILES like O1C2OC(COC2C1)CO. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold includes both the piperidine and the bicyclic ring connected via a single bond if the central chain is considered part of the linker. But earlier analysis suggested the piperidine is a side chain. Therefore, the final answer is the bicyclic ring's SMILES after removing substituents. So, the Output Scaffold would be \"C1OC2OCCOC2C1O\". But I need to check if this is valid. Alternatively, maybe the correct SMILES is O=C1CCCN1 for the piperidine, but that's just the ring. Wait, no, the piperidine is C1CCCN1. But if it's a side chain, it's removed. Therefore, the scaffold is just the bicyclic ring. So the final answer is {\"Output Scaffold\": \"C1OC2OCCOC2C1O\"}.",
