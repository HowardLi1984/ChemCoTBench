I don't have the ability to execute or run external programs, nor can I perform complex chemical structure modifications without visual or computational tools.\n\nHowever, I can offer a general approach on how one might approach modifying a SMILES string to remove a specified functional group, which might be helpful for you or your development team:\n\n1. **Parse the SMILES String**: Use a library (like RDKit for Python) to parse the SMILES string into a molecular structure object. This allows for the manipulation of atoms and bonds.\n\n2. **Identify the Functional Group**: Write a function to identify the atoms and bonds constituting the specified functional group within the molecule. This could involve pattern matching against known structures of the functional group.\n\n3. **Remove the Functional Group**:\n   - **Option A (Simpler, Less Accurate)**: If the functional group is at the end of a chain, simply truncate the SMILES string at the appropriate point. This method is highly dependent on the SMILES string's format (e.g., canonical vs. a specific isomer orientation).\n   - **Option B (More Accurate, Complex)**: Using the molecular structure object, remove the identified atoms and adjust the bonds of the remaining atoms accordingly to maintain chemical validity.\n\n4. **Generate Modified SMILES**: After modification, use the library to generate a new SMILES string from the modified molecular structure object.\n\n**Example Pseudocode (Conceptual, Not Executable Here)**:\n```python\nimport rdkit.Chem as Chem\n\ndef remove_functional_group(smiles, func_group):\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    # Pseudocode for identifying and removing the functional group\n    func_atoms = identify_functional_group(mol, func_group)\n    for atom in func_atoms:\n        mol.RemoveAtom(atom.GetIdx())\n    # Adjust bonds and sanitize the molecule\n    Chem.SanitizeMol(mol)\n    return Chem.MolToSmiles(mol)\n\n# Example Input\nsmiles_input = \"CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1\"\nfunc_group_name = \"Carboxylic Acid\"\n\n# This would ideally return the SMILES with the carboxylic acid removed\nmodified_smiles = remove_functional_group(smiles_input, func_group_name)\nprint(modified_smiles)\n```\n\nGiven the constraints, here's a placeholder response as per your format request, acknowledging the limitation:\n\n{\"output\": \"Modification Not Possible in This Interface\"}",
