The molecule contains two fluorine atoms, which may contribute to its hydrophobicity and ability to penetrate cell membranes. It also has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which may enhance its binding affinity towards GSK3-beta by forming hydrogen bonds.\",\n\"Property Analysis\": \"Based on previous studies, this molecule was found to have weak GSK3-beta inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of around 200 \u03bcM. However, it still exhibits promising potential due to its structural similarity with known GSK3-beta inhibitors.\",\n\"Limitation in Source Molecule for Property\": \"One possible limitation of this molecule is the lack of a specific binding motif that targets the active site of GSK3-beta. This could result in weaker binding affinity compared to other GSK3-beta inhibitors. Additionally, the presence of multiple halogens in the molecule might affect its physicochemical properties such as lipophilicity and solubility, potentially leading to poor pharmacokinetics and reduced bioavailability.\",\n\"Optimization for Source Molecule\": \"To optimize this molecule, we suggest introducing additional functional groups that can better interact with the active site of GSK3-beta. Specifically, adding a hydroxyl or amino group to the indazole ring can provide additional hydrogen bond donors for interacting with residues in the binding pocket. Furthermore, reducing the number of halogens in the molecule may improve its pharmacokinetics and reduce toxicity. We propose replacing one or both fluorine atoms with smaller groups such as hydrogen, methyl, or ethyl. Finally, considering the role of lipophilicity in GSK3-beta inhibition, we recommend increasing the overall lipophilicity of the molecule through the addition of alkyl side chains or aromatic rings. \",\n\"Final Target Molecule\": \"CC(NC(=O)Nc1cc2[nH]nc(OCCOC(F)(F)F)c2cn1)c1ccc(CH3)cc1.\""
