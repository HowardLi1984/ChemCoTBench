One such modification is the replacement of the bulky bromine atom with smaller fluorine or chlorine atoms to reduce interactions with off-target receptors. Another modification is the addition of substituents to the aromatic rings to enhance binding to the D2 receptor. For example, the addition of a fluorine atom to the 4-position of one of the benzene rings has been shown to increase binding affinity by up to 10-fold. Other modifications include the addition of hydroxyl groups to the aromatic rings to increase solubility and plasma protein binding. These modifications can also alter the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound, such as increasing oral bioavailability and half-life.\",\n\"Final Target Molecule\": \"One of the most promising optimizations of bromocriptine is the compound SCH-23390 (also known as raclopride), which has been developed by the pharmaceutical company Schering AG. SCH-23390 contains a substituted indole ring fused to two phenyl rings and contains a quaternary ammonium group similar to bromocriptine. Unlike bromocriptine, however, SCH-23390 is highly selective for the dopamine D2 receptor and has a potency up to 10 times greater than bromocriptine. Additionally, SCH-23390 has improved pharmacokinetic properties compared to bromocriptine, including higher oral bioavailability and a longer half-life. SCH-23390 has been widely used in preclinical studies and has shown promise as a treatment for movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and addiction.}"

There are three nitrogen atoms present in this molecule, with one being a nitrone moiety.\",\n\"Property Analysis\": \"This molecule was designed to have moderate Dopamine D2 Receptor activity. It has been reported to have Ki value of 0.89uM with respect to dopamine receptors. However, it lacks potency and selectivity for D2 receptors compared to standard drugs such as haloperidol which have Ki values less than 0.1uM for D2 receptors.\",\n\"Limitation in Source Molecule for Property\": \"The limitation of the source molecule for its low potency towards dopamine receptors can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the presence of carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring reduces the lipophilicity and hydrophobic interactions between the molecule and the receptor. Secondly, the substitution on the benzene ring and pyran ring reduces the electron density at the site of action and hence decreases the binding affinity towards D2 receptors. Thirdly, the bulky size of the molecule restricts its access to the site of action inside the receptor pocket, which further decreases the binding affinity.\",\n\"Optimization for Source Molecule\": \"To overcome the limitations of the source molecule and enhance its potency towards D2 receptors, we need to optimize various structural features of the molecule. Firstly, replacement of the carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring with an oxygen or sulfur atom can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, thereby enhancing the binding affinity towards D2 receptors. Secondly, removal of substituents from the benzene ring or replacing them with groups like methyl or chlorine can increase the electron density at the site of action, thereby improving the binding affinity. Thirdly, introduction of conformational restriction in the structure by linking the benzene ring to the pyran ring through a rigid bridge can restrict the size of the molecule and allow better access to the site of action inside the receptor pocket. Finally, incorporation of aromatic groups into the molecule can enhance the hydrophobic interactions and improve the binding affinity towards D2 receptors.\",\n\"Final Target Molecule\": \"Based on the above considerations, the final target molecule was designed as follows: Replacement of the carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring with an oxygen atom, addition of a methyl group at position 7 of the benzene ring, replacement of the substituent at position 3 of the pyran ring with a methyl group, introduction of a cyclohexane group connecting the benzene ring to the pyran ring, and addition of a phenyl group at position 6 of the pyran ring. This resulted in the following SMILES representation of the final target molecule: CC(=O)c1ccc(Cc2ccccc2C3ccccc3C)ccc1[nH]2CCCC(=OC)=C(C)=C1.

Similarly, if the model indicates that replacing the carbonyl groups with amide groups would improve DRD2 activity but not toxicity, researchers could make that modification to create another derivative.

One of the nitrogen atoms on the 6-membered ring is bonded to an oxygen atom, forming a carboxamide group (-CONH2). The 6-membered ring also contains a carbonyl group (-CO-), which makes it a lactam group. One of the nitrogen atoms on the 6-membered ring is also bonded to a carboxylic acid moiety (-COOH), which makes it an amino acid moiety. The 5-membered ring contains a tertiary nitrogen atom that forms a pi-bond with a phenyl group. The phenyl group has four carbon atoms connected in a single bond and three of them have hydrogen atoms attached.\",\n\"Property Analysis\": \"The source molecule has a known DRD2 activity of 0.4098 nM. DRD2 is a protein found on dopaminergic neurons throughout the brain and plays a key role in reward signaling. It is involved in both Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. The DRD2 activity property measures the binding affinity of a molecule to the DRD2 receptor, with lower values indicating higher affinities. This property is measured using a radioligand binding assay, where the radiolabeled ligand competes with the unlabeled test compounds for binding sites on the receptor. The IC50 value is then determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal dose-response curve. The binding site of DRD2 is made up of several regions including the D1-like region, the D2-like region, and the extracellular loops. The D1-like region is composed of residues from TM1, TM3, TM4, and TM5, while the D2-like region is composed of residues from TM1, TM2, TM4, and TM5. The D1-like region is more hydrophobic than the D2-like region, but the D2-like region has more polar residues, especially those in the D2-like region. The extracellular loops are located between the transmembrane domains and contain many charged residues. These charged residues play a critical role in stabilizing the ligand in the binding pocket and are important for specificity.\",\n\"Limitation in Source Molecule for Property\": \"There are several limitations to the source molecule for improving its DRD2 activity. Firstly, the source molecule does not have a bulky or aromatic substituent on the nitrogen atom of the lactam ring, which would likely increase the hydrophobicity of the compound. Secondly, the source molecule has a hydroxyl group on the nitrogen atom of the lactam ring, which may interfere with binding. Thirdly, the source molecule has a carboxylic acid moiety on the nitrogen atom of the lactam ring, which may reduce the basicity of the compound and decrease its ability to form ionic interactions with the DRD2 receptor.\",\n\"Optimization for Source Molecule\": \"To optimize the source molecule for increasing its DRD2 activity, several modifications could be made. Firstly, replacing the hydroxyl group on the lactam ring with a bulky or aromatic substituent would likely increase the hydrophobicity of the compound. Secondly, removing the carboxylic acid moiety on the lactam ring would reduce its basicity and allow it to form stronger ionic interactions with the positively charged residues in the D2-like region of the DRD2 binding site. Thirdly, adding a bulky or aromatic substituent to the amino acid moiety would increase the hydrophobicity of the compound and potentially increase its binding affinity. Lastly, modifying the substituents on the phenyl group to increase their lipophilicity would also increase the hydrophobicity of the compound and potentially increase its binding affinity.\",\n\"Final Target Molecule\": \"The final target molecule for improving DRD2 activity is not provided as this is a service for chemical synthesis companies and will depend on the specific needs and requirements of each company.

This low value indicates that this compound does not have significant affinity towards the dopamine D2 receptor and may require further optimization to improve its potency.\",\n\"Limitation in Source Molecule for Property\": \"One potential limitation of the source molecule could be its large size and molecular complexity. These factors can contribute to poor solubility, reduced permeability, and decreased overall bioavailability.

Finally, some functional groups may negatively impact the molecule's binding affinity.\",\n\"Optimization for Source Molecule\": \"To optimize the source molecule for improved dopamine D2 receptor activity, several strategies could be considered. Firstly, simplifying the molecule by reducing the number of rings and functional groups could improve its pharmacokinetic properties such as solubility and permeability. Secondly, replacing some functional groups with more favorable groups such as hydrogen bond donors or acceptors could improve the molecule's binding affinity. Thirdly, increasing the lipophilicity of the molecule by introducing additional hydrophobic groups could also improve its binding affinity.

This simplified structure still retains the core scaffold of the original source molecule while removing some of its complexities. The nitrile group has been replaced with a simple amide, the chlorine has been moved to a more accessible position, and some rings have been simplified. These changes should improve the molecule's solubility, permeability, and binding affinity towards the dopamine D2 receptor.\"}"
