            "Limitation in Source Molecule for Property": "The carboxylic acid group reduces lipophilicity and membrane permeability. The molecule's size exceeds optimal range for oral bioavailability (Lipinski's rule suggests MW < 500). The multiple aromatic rings and extended conjugation system may reduce solubility. The thiazolidine-dione moiety may present metabolic liability.",
            "Optimization for Source Molecule": "1) Replace the carboxylic acid with a more drug-like bioisostere such as tetrazole or amide to improve permeability while maintaining hydrogen bonding capacity. 2) Reduce molecular weight by removing one aromatic ring. 3) Break extended conjugation to improve solubility. 4) Add polar groups to improve solubility while maintaining lipophilicity balance.",

            "Structural Analysis of Source Molecule": "The source molecule contains a piperidine ring fused to a cyclohexane ring, with an amide linkage to a quinolone-type structure. It has multiple polar functional groups including alcohols (-OH), amides (NC=O), and tertiary amines. The molecule contains an isopropyl group attached to the quinolone nitrogen. The structure appears complex with multiple ring systems and several hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.",
            "Property Analysis": "The molecule has several features that may negatively impact its QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness): 1) High molecular weight, likely exceeding 500 Da; 2) Multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors; 3) High rotatable bond count; 4) Multiple stereocenters increasing complexity; 5) The presence of the quinolone substructure may contribute to toxicity concerns.",
            "Limitation in Source Molecule for Property": "The main limitations affecting QED include: excessive molecular weight, high polarity, potential metabolic instability due to multiple functional groups, and complexity of the molecular structure. The presence of too many hydrogen bond donors and acceptors likely exceeds Lipinski's Rule of Five criteria. The molecule also appears to have a charge separation (salt form) which can negatively impact permeability.",
            "Optimization for Source Molecule": "To improve QED: 1) Reduce molecular weight by removing non-essential groups like the isopropyl substituent; 2) Reduce the number of hydrogen bond donors by replacing the alcohol group with a less polar group; 3) Simplify the structure by replacing the bicyclic piperidine-cyclohexane system with a simpler ring system; 4) Maintain key pharmacophore elements while reducing overall complexity; 5) Remove the salt form if present to improve membrane permeability.",
