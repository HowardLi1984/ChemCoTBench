Properties influencing QED include molecular weight (MW), lipophilicity (logP), hydrogen bond donors (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), polar surface area (PSA), number of rotatable bonds (ROTB), number of aromatic rings, and structural alerts.\",\n    \"Limitation_in_Source_Molecule_for_Property\": \"The source molecule likely has a suboptimal QED score due to its high molecular weight, significant structural complexity, potentially high number of rotatable bonds (especially with the isopropyl group and linker), and the presence of a large, relatively non-polar, multi-ring isoquinoline-dione system. These factors tend to push the molecule outside the preferred property space for oral drugs.\",\n    \"Optimization_for_Source_Molecule\": \"To improve the QED score, the optimization focuses on reducing molecular complexity and size, particularly by replacing the large N-isopropylisoquinoline-1,3-dione moiety. Replacing it with a smaller, less complex group like a simple phenyl ring via the amide linkage (forming a benzamide) will decrease MW, reduce the number of aromatic rings and potentially rotatable bonds, while retaining the core bicyclic amine and amino alcohol linker structures.\",\n    \"Final_Target_Molecule\": \"CNC(=O)N(C)CC(O)CN1C2CCC1CC(NC(=O)c1ccccc1)C2\"\n  }\n]"
