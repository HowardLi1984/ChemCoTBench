The input molecule's SMILES is CCC(CO)Oc1cc(NCc2ccccc2)c2ncn(C(C)C)c2c1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES structure correctly. Let's break it down step by step. Starting from the left, \"CCC(CO)O...\" indicates a propane chain (CCC) with a branch. The branch is at the second carbon, connected to a group that starts with CO. Then there's an oxygen attached via an ether linkage (Oc1...), which suggests an aromatic ring.\n\nLooking at the \"CO\" part: that's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). The oxygen here is part of a hydroxyl group. So that's one instance of -O as a hydroxyl.\n\nNext, after the ether oxygen (O), there's an aromatic ring (c1cc...). The substituents on the ring include an N-alkyl chain (NCc2ccccc2), which is a benzylamine group. Then there's another heterocyclic ring (c2ncn(C(C)C)c2c1). This part has a methyl group attached to a nitrogen (C(C)C), but I don't see any hydroxyls here.\n\nSo, checking for hydroxyl groups (-OH): the only one I can find is in the CO part (the hydroxymethyl). The other oxygen in the ether (Oc1...) is part of an ether linkage, not a hydroxyl. Similarly, the oxygen in the amide or other parts would be part of different functional groups.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.",

The molecule's SMILES is COc1cccc(Cl)c1-c1ccc(COC2COc3nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES structure. Let me break it down. The main structure is a biphenyl system connected by a single bond. The left part is COc1cccc(Cl)c1, which is a chlorinated phenyl group with a methoxy (OCH3) substituent. The right part is c1ccc(COC2COc3nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2)cc1. \n\nLooking at the right side, the substituent on the phenyl ring is COC2COc3nc... So, let's follow that. The group attached is COC2COc... Breaking this down: C-O-C (which is an ether), then a C2 (a two-membered ring? Wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane? Or perhaps the numbering is different. Let me write it out step by step.\n\nThe substituent starts with COC2COc3... So, after the initial COC, there's a ring structure. The \"2COc3\" part might be a cyclohexane or similar. Wait, the SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to denote connections. So, COC2COc3... Here, the 2 and 3 are ring closure numbers. Let me parse this carefully.\n\nStarting from the COC part: C-O-C connected to a ring. The \"2COc3\" part suggests that the oxygen is part of a ring. Wait, maybe the structure is a dioxane ring or something similar. Let's reconstruct:\n\nThe substituent is COC2COc3... So, the first C is connected to O, then C (which is part of a ring closure labeled 2). Then another O, connected to a c (aromatic carbon) which is part of another ring closure labeled 3. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane with oxygen atoms? Or maybe it's a more complex ring system.\n\nAlternatively, let's parse the entire substituent step by step. The substituent is COC2COc3nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2. Breaking this down:\n\n- COC: methoxy group (OCH3?), but then the next part is 2COc3... Wait, perhaps the \"C2\" refers to a ring closure. Let's see. The substituent is attached to the phenyl ring as COC2COc3... So, starting from the phenyl's carbon, it's connected to O, then C, then O, which is part of a ring closure (number 2). Then, another C connected to O, which is part of another ring closure (number 3). \n\nAlternatively, the substituent might have a structure like O-C-O-C, forming a ring. For example, a five-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. Wait, maybe it's a dioxolane ring or something similar. Let's try to draw it mentally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is COC followed by a ring formed by C2 and O. Let me see: COC2COc3... So, the first C is connected to O (from COC), then the next C is part of a ring closure with the 2. Then another O connected to a c (aromatic carbon) which is part of ring closure 3. This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe looking at the entire substituent would help.\n\nThe substituent is COC2COc3nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2. Let's parse this:\n\n- The substituent starts with COC: that's a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a carbon. Wait, but then the next character is 2, which is a ring closure. So, the carbon after O (C) is connected to another part of the molecule via ring closure 2. Then comes COc3... So, after the ring closure 2, there's a C connected to O, then a c (aromatic carbon) with ring closure 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclic ether. For example, the part C2COc3 would form a ring where C2 is connected to C (from COC) and O, which is connected to c3. This is getting complex. Let's try to write the substituent structure step by step.\n\nStarting from the phenyl ring: the substituent is COC2COc3... So:\n\n1. C (attached to the phenyl)\n2. O\n3. C (connected to O and to ring closure 2)\n4. Then O connected to C (which is part of ring closure 2)\n5. Then c3 (aromatic carbon connected via ring closure 3)\n6. ... and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent has a structure where there's an oxygen in a side chain. The fragment we're looking for is \"-O\", which are hydroxyl groups (OH) in the side chain. But the SMILES for the fragment is \"-O\", which might be a hydroxyl group attached to a non-aromatic carbon. Wait, the fragment name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\", so we need to count all hydroxyl (-OH) groups that are in the side chains, not part of aromatic rings or other groups like nitro, etc.\n\nBut in SMILES, hydroxyls are represented as -O- (if it's an ether) or -OH. Wait, but in the input molecule, are there any -OH groups? Let's check the SMILES.\n\nThe input molecule's SMILES: COc1cccc(Cl)c1-c1ccc(COC2COc3nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2)cc1\n\nLooking for -OH groups: The SMILES has several oxygen atoms. Let's list all oxygen atoms and their contexts.\n\n1. The first part is COc..., which is a methoxy group (OCH3), so O connected to C (CH3) and the aromatic ring. This is an ether oxygen, not a hydroxyl.\n\n2. Then, in the substituent on the right phenyl ring: COC2COc3...\n\n- The COC part here: C-O-C, which is an ether. Then 2COc3: the C after O is part of a ring closure (2) and connected to another O (COc3). So, the O here is part of an ether in a ring structure.\n\n3. Then, later in the substituent: [N+](=O)[O-]. This is a nitro group (NO2), so two oxygen atoms here as part of the nitro group. These are not hydroxyls.\n\n4. Are there any -OH groups? Let me check all O atoms:\n\n- The first O is in COc (methoxy).\n- The next O is in COC (ether).\n- Then another O in COc (another ether?).\n- The nitro group has two O atoms.\n- Are there any O atoms that are hydroxyl (-OH)?\n\nLooking at the SMILES, I don't see any explicit -OH groups. All O atoms are part of ethers (O connected to two carbons), nitro groups, or other functional groups. The fragment SMILES given is \"-O\", which might be a typo for \"-OH\", but the user specified the fragment as \"-O\" with the name \"side-chain hydroxyls\". However, hydroxyls are -OH, not -O- (which is ether). \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the SMILES fragment. If the fragment is supposed to be hydroxyl groups (-OH), the SMILES should be \"-O\" but with explicit H? Or maybe it's a different group. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is ether oxygens in the side chain. But the name says hydroxyls, which are -OH.\n\nGiven that, maybe the user intended to count hydroxyl groups, but the SMILES provided is \"-O\". That's conflicting. Because \"-O\" in SMILES would be an oxygen with one bond, which is not possible unless it's a hydroxyl (O- with a hydrogen). But in SMILES, hydroxyl is represented as -O- (as part of a chain) but with an H attached. Wait, no. In SMILES, a hydroxyl group is written as -O-H, but in practice, it's often written as -O or -OH. However, in the input molecule's SMILES, there are no -OH groups. All oxygens are part of ethers (O between two carbons) or nitro groups.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the input SMILES:\n\nCOc1cccc(Cl)c1-c1ccc(COC2COc3nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2)cc1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- COc... : methoxy group (OCH3)\n- ...COC2COc3... : here, the O's are part of ethers. The COC2COc3 part: C-O-C (ether), then C (ring closure 2), then O connected to c3 (aromatic carbon in another ring).\n- The nitro group is [N+](=O)[O-], which has two O's.\n\nSo, all oxygen atoms are part of ethers (OCH3, O in COC, O in COc3) or nitro groups. There are no hydroxyl (-OH) groups in the molecule. Therefore, the count of side-chain hydroxyls would be zero.\n\nBut wait, the fragment SMILES is \"-O\". If the fragment is just an oxygen atom in a certain context, like being a hydroxyl, but the input molecule doesn't have any hydroxyls. So the count should be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user considers ether oxygens as part of the fragment. But the fragment name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\", which are -OH groups. Since there are no -OH groups, the count is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0.",

But wait, the user mentioned \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones,\" so I have to make sure I'm counting the carbonyl groups that are part of aldehydes or ketones and not other groups like amides or esters.\n\nThe input molecule is COc1ccc(OCC(=O)Nc2ccc3c(c2)nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2)n3C)cc1. Let me parse that SMILES. Breaking it down:\n\nStarting from the left: COc1ccc(...)cc1. That's a methoxy group attached to a benzene ring. Then there's OCC(=O)Nc... \u2013 so an oxygen connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a carbonyl (C=O), then an N. That part is O-C-CH2-C(=O)-N... So the carbonyl here is part of an amide group (since it's connected to an N), right? Because the structure is R-C(=O)-N. Amides have the carbonyl attached to an amine, so that's not a ketone or aldehyde. So this =O here would be part of an amide, not counted.\n\nThen looking further: there's another part, CCNC(=O)c2ccco2. Let's parse that. The sequence is C-C-N-C(=O)-... So that's a chain: CH2-CH2-NH-C(=O)- attached to a benzene ring (c2ccco2). Wait, the c2ccco2 is a ring? Let's see: c2 (carbon 1), then c c o \u2013 so positions 2, 3, and 4. The ring would be a five-membered ring? Wait, c2ccco2 would be a benzene ring with an oxygen? Let me count the atoms. Starting at position 1 (c2), then positions 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (o), but that's only four atoms. Hmm, maybe it's a furan ring? Wait, no, the SMILES notation for furan would be o1cccc1 or similar. Maybe it's a benzene ring with an oxygen substituent? Wait, maybe the SMILES is c2ccco2. Let's parse that. The atom sequence is: c2 connected to c, c, c, o, and back to c2. Wait, that would form a five-membered ring: position 1 (c2), position 2 (c), position 3 (c), position 4 (c), position 5 (o), and then back to position 1 (c2). That would make a five-membered ring with an oxygen. Wait, but that's not possible because the ring closure numbers must match. Let me check again. The SMILES is c2ccco2. The 'o2' part: the '2' refers back to the second atom in the ring. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let's break it down:\n\nStarting with c2, then c, c, c, o, and then the closure is o2. Wait, that would mean that the oxygen is connected back to the second atom. So the ring would be: atom 1 (c2), atom 2 (c), atom 3 (c), atom 4 (c), atom 5 (o), which connects back to atom 2 (c). That would form a five-membered ring with atoms 2 (c), 5 (o), and possibly others? Hmm, maybe it's a ring like O connected to two carbons, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nThe key part here is the NC(=O)c2ccco2. The NC(=O) is part of a urea or amide group. Wait, NC(=O) attached to a ring. So that carbonyl is part of an amide, right? Because the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl. So that's another amide group, so the =O here would not count as a ketone or aldehyde.\n\nSo looking at the entire molecule, where are the carbonyl groups that are aldehydes or ketones? Let's list all the =O groups:\n\n1. In OCC(=O)Nc... \u2192 amide, so not counted.\n2. In NC(=O)c2ccco2 \u2192 amide, not counted.\nWait, are there any other =O groups? Let me check again.\n\nThe molecule's SMILES is COc1ccc(OCC(=O)Nc2ccc3c(c2)nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2)n3C)cc1. Let's see:\n\n- The first part after COc1ccc( is OCC(=O)Nc... So that's O connected to CH2-C(=O)-N... \u2192 amide.\n- Then in the part CCNC(=O)c2ccco2: C-C-N-C(=O)... \u2192 amide again.\n\nAre there any other =O groups? Let me check again. The SMILES string is:\n\nCOc1ccc(OCC(=O)Nc2ccc3c(c2)nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2)n3C)cc1\n\nBreaking it into parts:\n\n- COc1ccc( ... )cc1: the main benzene ring with methoxy group.\n- The part inside the main ring's substituent: OCC(=O)Nc2ccc3c(c2)nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2)n3C\n\nSo OCC(=O)N... \u2192 amide.\n\nThen in the substituent on N: c2ccc3c(c2)nc(...)n3C\n\nIn the nc(...) part: nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2) \u2192 the CCNC(=O) is another amide.\n\nSo all the carbonyl groups in this molecule are part of amides, not ketones or aldehydes. Aldehydes would be R-C(=O)H, and ketones R-C(=O)-R'. Here, all the =O groups are connected to N (amide) or O (like in esters, but in this case, the O is part of the methoxy group, which is OCH3, so no carbonyl there).\n\nWait, maybe I missed a part. Let me re-examine the entire SMILES:\n\nThe main chain: COc1ccc(OCC(=O)Nc2ccc3c(c2)nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2)n3C)cc1\n\nLooking at every group:\n\n- OCC(=O): That's O-C-C(=O)-N... which is an ester? Wait, O connected to C, which is connected to C(=O). Wait, O-C-C(=O)-N would be an ester if the other oxygen is attached. Wait, O-C-C(=O)-N would be like glycolic acid amide? Or perhaps it's a carbamate? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The structure here is O-C-CH2-C(=O)-N. So that's an ester group? Wait, no. Esters are R-O-C(=O)-R. But here it's O-C-CH2-C(=O)-N. So the oxygen is part of an ether (O-C) connected to a CH2 which is connected to a carbonyl group, which is then connected to an amine. So that's an amide group (since the carbonyl is adjacent to the N). So the C(=O)N is an amide. Therefore, the =O here is part of an amide, not a ketone or aldehyde.\n\nSimilarly, the other part is CCNC(=O)c2ccco2. The C(=O) here is attached to N, making another amide.\n\nSo in the entire molecule, all carbonyl groups are part of amides, which are not considered aldehydes or ketones. Therefore, the count should be zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check once more. Is there any other carbonyl group not part of an amide or ester?\n\nLooking at the entire SMILES again. The molecule has two =O groups: one in OCC(=O)N and one in CCNC(=O). Both are part of amides. No other =O groups. So the answer is zero.",

The molecule has a thiophene ring (S in the ring) connected to various groups. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the main ring: CSc1c(...)n(...)c2ccccc12. The numbering here might be a bit tricky. The main ring is probably a bicyclic system because of the 'c1...c2ccccc12' part. The sulfur (S) is part of the first ring, and there's a nitrogen (n) in another position.\n\nLooking at the substituents on the main ring:\n- CC(=O)Nc2ccc(F)cc2: This is a ethyl group (CC) attached to a carbonyl (C=O), then an NH group connected to a fluorophenyl ring (c2ccc(F)cc2). Wait, the structure here is CC(=O)N connected to a benzene ring with fluorine. So the amide group here is -C(=O)N- attached to the benzene.

Let's look for instances where a carbonyl (C=O) is directly bonded to a nitrogen.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, the SMILES has a part: C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4. Wait, that's C(=O) connected to C(F), which is double-bonded to another carbon. So that's a ketone group (C(=O)) but connected to a fluorine-bearing carbon with a double bond. Then there's another part: N3CCN(...). Let me parse the entire structure.\n\nBreaking down the molecule:\n\n- COc1cc2...: This is a methoxy group attached to a benzene ring (c1cc2...).\n- The benzene ring (c1cc2) has substituents. The 'nc(N3CCN(...)CC3)' part: so there's an N connected to a 3-membered ring (N3...CC3). Wait, the N3 is part of a ring closure. The structure after nc is N3CCN(...)CC3. So the nitrogen at position 3 is part of a ring? Let me sketch this mentally.\n\nThe part N3CCN(...)CC3 would form a ring: N connected to C-C-N, then back to the N via CC3. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nThe fragment is N3CCN(...)CC3. So starting with N3, then CC, then N which has a substituent (C(=O)...), then CC3. So the ring here is N3-C-C-N-C-C-3? That would form a six-membered ring with two nitrogens? Wait, the N3 is the starting point. Then two carbons (C-C), then another N, then two more carbons (C-C), and back to position 3. That would make a six-membered ring: positions 3 (N), 4 (C), 5 (C), 6 (N), 7 (C), 8 (C), closing back to 3. But that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the N3 is part of a three-membered ring? Let me think again. The SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to indicate closures. So N3...CC3 would mean that the N is connected to a chain that ends with CC3, which connects back to the N at position 3. So perhaps the structure is a ring like N-C-C connected back to the N via the CC3 part. Wait, maybe it's a piperazine-like ring. Let's see: N3 connected to C-C-N, then C-C-3. That would form a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. So positions: N3 - C - C - N - C - C - N3. That's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens, which is a piperazine structure. So the ring here is a piperazine ring. The substituent on the N in the piperazine is C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4. So the N in the piperazine has a carbonyl group attached.\n\nLooking at that substituent: C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4. The C(=O) is connected to a C(F) which is double-bonded to another C (C=), which is connected to a benzene ring (c4ccccc4). So that part is a carbonyl group (amide) connected to a fluorinated alkene and a benzene.\n\nNow, the fragment we're looking for is -C(=O)N-. In the molecule, the amide group would be where the carbonyl is attached directly to a nitrogen. In the substituent on the piperazine ring, the N is part of the piperazine and attached to the carbonyl. So the structure here is N-C(=O)... So the amide group is present here. Is there another occurrence?\n\nLooking at the rest of the molecule: The other parts include another nc(N) group. The 'nc(N)c2cc1OC' part: that's an amino group (N) attached to the aromatic ring. But that's an amine (NH2) group, not an amide. The amide requires the carbonyl attached to the nitrogen.\n\nSo in the input molecule, the only occurrence of -C(=O)N- is in the substituent on the piperazine ring. Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The SMILES is COc1cc2nc(N3CCN(C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4)CC3)nc(N)c2cc1OC. The part after the first nc is (N3CCN(...)CC3). The N3 is part of the ring. The N in the piperazine ring is connected to C(=O)... So the structure is N-C(=O)... which is the amide group. So that's one occurrence. Are there any other carbonyl groups attached to nitrogen?\n\nLooking at the rest of the molecule, the other nitrogen groups are nc(N) which is an amine (NH), and the other parts don't have a carbonyl attached directly to nitrogen. So only one occurrence of the amide fragment -C(=O)N-.",

Halogens are fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At), though astatine is rare.

The main structure starts with Cc1cc(=O)oc2cc... which is a methyl group attached to a benzene ring with an ester group (O=CO). Then there's another benzene ring connected via an oxygen. The part NC(=O)Cc3ccc(Br)cc3 is an amide group (NC=O) attached to a ethyl group (Cc3...) which connects to another benzene ring (ccc3cc3). In this benzene ring, there's a Br (bromine) atom at the fourth position: ccc(Br)cc3.\n\nSo, the only halogen present here is bromine (Br). There's one Br atom in the structure. Therefore, the count should be 1. I need to make sure there aren't any other halogens. Scanning the SMILES again, the other atoms are C, O, N (all non-halogens). So yes, only one Br.

The fragment SMILES given is \"-X\", where X typically represents a halogen atom.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that halogens in organic chemistry are fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and sometimes astatine (At), though the latter is rare. The SMILES notation for halogens would be Cl, Br, etc. The fragment SMILES here is \"-X\", which probably means any halogen atom attached via a single bond. However, in SMILES notation, the hyphen usually denotes a single bond. But since the fragment is \"-X\", maybe it's looking for a halogen atom connected by a single bond to another atom. Alternatively, maybe it's just any occurrence of a halogen atom regardless of bonding.\n\nLooking at the input molecule: CCC(=O)NC1CCc2c(Cl)c(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c2-c2ccc(OC)c(=O)cc21. Let's parse this SMILES structure. Breaking it down:\n\n- The molecule starts with CCC(=O)NC1... which is a chain leading into a cyclohexane ring (the 1CC... part). Then there's a c2c(Cl)... which indicates a chlorine atom attached to the aromatic ring. The Cl is explicitly present here. \n\nLooking through the entire structure, the only halogen present is Cl. Let's check for other halogens. The rest of the substituents are OCH3 groups (OC), carbonyl groups (=O), and other carbons. There's only one Cl atom in the SMILES notation: c(Cl). So the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but the fragment name is \"halogens\", which includes all halogens. So any F, Cl, Br, I in the molecule. The given SMILES here is \"-X\", which might imply that the halogen is connected via a single bond. But in the molecule, the Cl is attached as a substituent on the aromatic ring, which in SMILES is written as c(Cl), meaning the Cl is connected via a single bond to the carbon.

The CO part here is the methyl (C) connected to oxygen (O), forming the -OCH3 group.\n\nLooking at the rest of the structure, after the first part, there's OCCNC(C)C.

The input molecule's SMILES is COCCNC1CCC(Nc2cc(-c3nc(NCC4CCOCC4)ccc3Cl)c(Cl)cn2)CC1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES correctly. Let me break it down. Starting from the left: C-O-C-C... So the first part is COCC. Wait, CO would be a methoxy group if it's connected as O-Me. Let me check. The first part is C (maybe a methyl), then O connected to another C. Wait, the SMILES starts with COCCNC1... So the first two atoms are C-O, but the next C is connected to that O? So COC... That would be O connected to two carbons: the first C is part of the methoxy (O-Me), then another C attached to O. Wait, methoxy is O-Me, which is -O-C. So in the molecule, any occurrence of O connected to a methyl group (C with three H's) would count as a methoxy group.\n\nLooking at the SMILES: COCC... The first part is C-O-C-C. So the O here is connected to a methyl group (the first C) and another C. So that's a methoxy group (O-Me) attached to the next carbon. So that's one methoxy group.\n\nThen, let's look further into the molecule. After the first part, there's NCC4CCOCC4. Let's parse that. The part CCOCC is O connected to two CH2 groups, making an ethylene glycol chain, perhaps. So that's an ether, but not methoxy. The CCOCC is a five-membered ring? Wait, the SMILES is NCC4CCOCC4. The 4 is a ring closure. So the structure is N-C-C4-C-C-O-C-C4. So that part forms a ring: the C4 is connected to the O, making a ring like O-C-C-C-C-O? Wait, maybe it's a morpholine ring? Because morpholine is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. Let's see: NCC4CCOCC4. Breaking it down: N connected to C connected to C4 (which is part of a ring). The ring would be C4 connected to C, C, O, C, C, and back to C4. So the ring is C-C-O-C-C-C, forming a six-membered ring. So the oxygen is in the ring. That oxygen is part of the ring structure, not a methoxy group because it's connected to two carbons in the ring. So that's not a methoxy.\n\nNow, looking at the rest of the molecule. There's a part -c3nc(...)ccc3Cl. The Cl substituents are attached to the aromatic rings, but no methoxy there. Then, the main chain has COCC at the beginning. So the first O is in a methoxy group (CO-), then the rest of the molecule doesn't have any other O connected to a methyl group. Wait, let's check again. The SMILES starts with COCCNC1... So the first three atoms are C-O-C (since COC is C-O-C). The first C is a methyl (since it's connected to O and then another C). So that's a methoxy group (-O-Me) attached to the next carbon. So that's one occurrence.\n\nIs there any other methoxy group in the molecule? Let's check the entire SMILES again. After the initial COCC..., there's N, then C1, which is part of a cyclohexane ring (CCC...CC1). Then there's N connected to a benzene ring (c2cc...). In the benzene ring, there's a substituent -c3nc(...)ccc3Cl. The c3 indicates another aromatic ring. Looking at that part: -c3nc(NCC4CCOCC4)ccc3Cl. The NCC4CCOCC4 part we already looked at, which is the morpholine ring. So the oxygen there is part of the ring, not methoxy.\n\nAny other O atoms? Let's see. The SMILES is COCCNC1CCC(Nc2cc(-c3nc(NCC4CCOCC4)ccc3Cl)c(Cl)cn2)CC1. The only O's are in COCC... and in CCOCC4 (the morpholine ring). So the only methoxy group is the first one, CO-.\n\nWait, but wait. The fragment SMILES given is -OMe, which is the methoxy group. So in the input molecule, every occurrence of an oxygen connected to a methyl group (CH3) would count. So in the SMILES, the COC part: the first C is methyl (since it's connected only to O and possibly other carbons? Wait, the first part is COCCNC1... So the first C is connected to O and another C. So the first C is CH2-O-C... Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's parse the SMILES more carefully.\n\nThe SMILES starts with C (atom 1) connected to O (atom 2). Then, atom 2 (O) is connected to C (atom 3), which is connected to another C (atom 4). Then atom 4 is connected to N (atom 5), and so on. So the O (atom 2) is connected to atom 1 (C) and atom 3 (C). So atom 1 is a methyl group (since it's connected only to O and three hydrogens), making the O connected to a methyl: that's a methoxy group (-O-Me). Then, the next C (atom 3) is connected to O (atom 2) and C (atom 4), so that's part of an ethyl group? Wait, COCC would be CH3-O-CH2-CH2... So the O is connected to a methyl (CH3) and a CH2 group. So the methoxy is the CH3-O- part. So that's one methoxy group.\n\nAre there any other methoxy groups in the molecule? Let's check the rest of the SMILES. After the initial COCCNC1..., the next O is in the morpholine ring (CCOCC4), which is part of a ring and not a methoxy. The rest of the molecule has Cl substituents but no other O's. So the total count of methoxy (-OMe) groups is 1.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to count the number of primary amine fragments in the given molecule. The fragment SMILES is -N, which represents a primary amine, meaning an NH2 group attached to a carbon. The input molecule is NC(=O)c1cccc2c(NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3)ncnc12.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES of the input molecule. Let's break it down. Starting with NC(=O)... That's an acetamide group. The N here is part of the amide, so it's a secondary amine (attached to the carbonyl carbon), so that's not a primary amine.\n\nNext, looking at the rest of the structure: there's a benzene ring (c1cccc2...). Then, there's a part with NCC3... The NC here is a methylene group attached to a nitrogen. The nitrogen in NC would be a secondary amine because it's connected to two carbons: one from the benzene ring and one from the CH2 (since it's N-C...). Wait, the NC is part of a chain: NCc3cccc(...) So the nitrogen is connected to the benzene ring (from c2) via a CH2 group. So the structure is N-CH2-... That nitrogen would have two carbons attached: the CH2 and the benzene ring. Therefore, it's a secondary amine, not primary.\n\nThen there's another part: Nc4nccs4. This is a pyrimidine ring (nccs4) with an NH group attached. The N here is connected to the ring (c4) and a hydrogen. Wait, the SMILES is Nc4nccs4. So the nitrogen is attached to the c4, which is part of the ring. The valence here: the nitrogen in Nc4 would have two bonds: one to c4 and one hydrogen, making it a primary amine? Wait, no. If the nitrogen is part of the ring, like in an aromatic heterocycle, the bonding might be different. Let's see. The ring is c4nccs4. So the ring has four atoms: c4, n, c, c, s, and back to c4? Wait, SMILES notation for rings: each ring closure is a number. So c4nccs4 would form a five-membered ring? Let me parse that correctly. The atom sequence is c4, then n, then c, then c, then s, and the s connects back to c4 via the closure (4). So the ring is five-membered: c4, n, c, c, s. That forms a five-membered ring with two carbons, one nitrogen, one sulfur. The substituent is N attached to c4. So the N in Nc4 is connected to the c4 (which is part of the ring), and since the ring is aromatic, the bonding is such that the nitrogen may have a lone pair but is part of the aromatic system. Wait, but the substituent N here: the SMILES is Nc4... So the nitrogen is attached to the c4 as a substituent. That nitrogen would have three bonds: one to c4, and two hydrogens, making it a primary amine (NH2 group). But wait, aromatic amines can have different structures. If the nitrogen is part of an aromatic ring, like in pyridine, it's not a primary amine. But here, the N is a substituent on the aromatic ring. So in this case, the NH group attached to the ring would be a primary amine if it's NH2. Wait, the SMILES is Nc4... So the group is NH- attached to the ring. But primary amines are NH2 groups. An NH group attached to something else would be a secondary amine if it's connected to two carbons. Wait, no. A primary amine has the structure R-NH2, where R is any carbon-containing group. If the nitrogen is bonded to one carbon and two hydrogens, it's primary. If bonded to two carbons and one hydrogen, it's secondary. So in this case, the substituent N is attached to the c4 (a carbon in the ring) and has two hydrogens. So that would be a primary amine. But the SMILES here is written as Nc4... which would imply a single bond. So that's NH2 connected to the ring? Wait, SMILES notation: if it's written as Nc4, then the nitrogen has two hydrogens. Because in SMILES, each valence is accounted for. So N has three bonds. If it's connected to one carbon (c4), the other two bonds are hydrogens. So yes, that's NH2 as a substituent on the ring. Therefore, that would be a primary amine.\n\nNow, let's check all the nitrogen atoms in the input molecule:\n\n1. The first N in NC(=O)... That's part of an amide group. The structure is N-C(=O)-..., so the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl carbon and another carbon (the benzene ring). So that's a secondary amine (attached to two carbons), not primary.\n\n2. The N in NCc3... This is part of a CH2NH group. The nitrogen is connected to the CH2 (from NCc3) and the benzene ring (from the c2). So that's two carbons attached, making it a secondary amine.\n\n3. The N in Nc4... This is attached to the c4 of the five-membered ring. As discussed, this is NH2, so primary amine.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The SMILES is Nc4nccs4. The N here is connected to c4, which is part of the ring. The nitrogen in the ring is part of the aromatic system. Wait, the ring is written as c4nccs4. So the atoms are c4, n, c, c, s, and back to c4. The N in the ring (the second atom) is part of the aromatic ring. That's different from the substituent N. The substituent N is attached to c4. So the substituent is NH2 (since it's written as Nc4, which would be -NH- if it's a single bond, but in SMILES, if it's just N without any charge or explicit H, it would be NH2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think: in SMILES, when you write NH2 as a substituent, it's [NH2]. But in this case, the substituent is written as Nc4. So the nitrogen has two hydrogens and one bond to c4. So that's NH2 attached to c4. Therefore, that's a primary amine.\n\nAdditionally, there's another N in the molecule: the one in the ring. The ring has an n (lowercase), which denotes an aromatic nitrogen. That's part of the ring's structure and not a substituent, so it's not an amine.\n\nSo in total, how many primary amines are there?\n\nThe substituent N on the c4 (part of the five-membered ring) is one primary amine. Are there any others?\n\nLooking at the SMILES again: NC(=O)c1cccc2c(NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3)ncnc12.\n\nBreaking it down step by step:\n\n- The main chain starts with NC(=O), which is the amide group. The N here is secondary.\n\nThen, the benzene ring (c1cccc2...). Attached to position 2 of the benzene (c2) is a group: c(...)ncnc12. Wait, this might be a fused ring. The main benzene ring (c1cccc2...) is fused to another ring. The part after c2 is c(NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3)ncnc12. Let me parse this.\n\nThe c2 is connected to a nitrogen via NC: so c2 is connected to N-C-C3... which is a CH2NH group. Then, that C3 is part of another benzene ring (c3cccc(...)), which has a substituent Nc4... So the c3 ring has a substituent N attached to c4 of another ring (nccs4).\n\nBut back to the main structure. The fused ring part: after c2, the structure is c(...)ncnc12. So maybe a fused bicyclic system. The ncnc part suggests a five-membered ring with nitrogens.\n\nBut regardless, the key is to look for all -NH2 groups (primary amines). So far, the substituent Nc4 is one. Let's check if there are others.\n\nLooking at the SMILES again: the substituent Nc4 is part of the c3 ring. The c3 ring is in the NCc3 part. So the structure is NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3. So the c3 ring is a benzene ring (c3cccc(...)c3), with substituents at positions where the ... is. The substituent here is Nc4nccs4. So that's the NH2 attached to c4, which is part of the five-membered ring (nccs4). So that's one primary amine.\n\nAre there any other NH2 groups?\n\nLooking at the main fused ring: NC(=O)c1cccc2c(...)ncnc12. The part after c2 is c(...)ncnc12. The 'ncnc' suggests nitrogens in the fused ring. Let's see: the atoms after c2 are c(...) followed by n, c, n, c, and back to c1 and c2 (since it's 12). So perhaps a fused pyridine or similar ring. The nitrogens here (the 'n's) are part of the aromatic ring and are not amines. They are likely pyridine-like nitrogens, which are not considered amines since they are part of the aromatic system and don't have NH2 groups.\n\nSo the only primary amine is the substituent Nc4... which is NH2 attached to the five-membered ring. Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The substituent Nc4 is written as Nc4nccs4. So the N is attached to c4, which is part of the ring. The ring is nccs4. So the ring is five-membered: n (nitrogen), c, c, s, and back to c4. The substituent N is on c4. So that N is NH2, making it a primary amine. So that's one.\n\nIs there another NH2 group anywhere else?\n\nLooking at the SMILES again: the molecule starts with NC(=O)... That's an amide, so the N is part of CONH2, but here it's NC(=O), so it's R-NH-C(=O)-..., which is a secondary amine (since the N is connected to the carbonyl carbon and another carbon (the benzene ring)). So not primary.\n\nThen, the NCc3 part: N-C-C3. The N here is connected to a CH2 group (C) and the benzene ring (c2). So that's two carbons attached to N, making it a secondary amine.\n\nThen, the N in Nc4 is the only primary amine. So count is 1.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The SMILES for the fragment is -N, which represents a primary amine. A primary amine is R-NH2. So in SMILES, that would be N (with two Hs) attached to a carbon. So any nitrogen that has exactly one bond to carbon and two Hs counts.\n\nIn the input molecule, the only such nitrogen is the one attached to c4 (Nc4nccs4). Because in that case, the nitrogen is bonded to one carbon (c4) and has two Hs. All other nitrogens are either part of amides (secondary), part of aromatic rings (no Hs), or part of secondary amines (bonded to two carbons).\n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to count the number of primary amine groups in the given molecule. The input molecule's SMILES is Cc1cc(C#N)cc(C(=O)c2c(C(C)C)c(=O)[nH]c(=O)n2Cc2cc(N)nc(F)c2F)c1, and the fragment SMILES is -N, which represents a primary amine.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's SMILES. Let me break it down. The structure has several parts. Starting with Cc1cc(C#N)cc(...)c1. The benzene ring (c1cc...c1) has methyl group (C), a cyano group (C#N), and another substituent which is C(=O)... etc.\n\nLooking at the substituent after the second cc: C(=O)c2c(C(C)C)c(=O)[nH]c(=O)n2Cc2cc(N)nc(F)c2F. This part seems complex. Let's split it. The C(=O) is a carbonyl group attached to another ring. The ring here is c2c(...)n2, which is a five-membered ring? Let's check: c2 has a substituent C(C)C (isopropyl group), then another carbonyl (c(=O)), then [nH] (an NH group), another carbonyl (c(=O)), and then n2. Wait, the ring would be c2c(C(C)C)c(=O)[nH]c(=O)n2. That's a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and an NH. Then there's a Cc2cc(N)nc(F)c2F attached. The C connects to another benzene ring: c2cc(N)nc(F)c2F. Here, the ring has an amino group (N), a fluorine (F), and another fluorine? Wait, the SMILES is cc(N)nc(F)c2F. So the ring positions are: position 1 is connected to the C (from Cc2...), position 2 is cc(N), then nc(F), and c2F. So the amino group (N) is at position 2, and fluorines at positions 4 and 5? Not sure, but the key part is looking for the -NH2 groups.\n\nPrimary amines are -NH2 groups. The fragment SMILES is -N, which in SMILES notation would represent a nitrogen with two hydrogens (since it's a primary amine). However, in SMILES, a primary amine is typically written as NH2, but in aromatic contexts, like in aniline, it's N. Wait, but in SMILES, aromatic amines are represented as [nH] if they are part of an aromatic ring. But the fragment given here is -N, which might be a mistake or a specific way the user is representing primary amines. Wait, primary amines have the structure R-NH2. So in SMILES, that would be N (with two implicit hydrogens) if it's aliphatic. For example, in an aliphatic amine like CH3NH2, the SMILES would be CN. But in aromatic rings, like aniline, the NH2 is attached to the benzene ring, which would be written as N in SMILES but with two hydrogens. However, in aromatic contexts, nitrogen's hydrogen count can be tricky. For example, in pyridine, the nitrogen has no hydrogens, but in pyrrole, it has one. So for aniline, the correct SMILES would be c1ccccc1N, but the actual structure is NH2 attached to benzene, which in SMILES is represented as N with two hydrogens. Wait, no. In SMILES, if you write N attached to a benzene ring, it would be considered as aniline, which is NH2. But SMILES requires explicit hydrogen notation for aromatic nitrogens. Wait, maybe the user's fragment SMILES is -N, meaning a nitrogen with two hydrogens (primary amine) regardless of aromaticity. But how to count that in the input molecule.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES: let's look for any NH2 groups. The SMILES has a part: Cc2cc(N)nc(F)c2F. The 'N' here is in the benzene ring. Wait, the SMILES is Cc2cc(N)nc(F)c2F. Let's parse that. The 'cc(N)nc(F)c2F' part is a benzene ring (since lowercase c is aromatic). Positions: starting from the C connected to the previous part (Cc2...), then positions 1 (C), 2 (c), 3 (N), then n (which is aromatic nitrogen), c(F), and back to c2. Wait, this might be a six-membered ring: c2 is the first carbon, then next is c connected to N, then n (aromatic N), c(F), then c2 again. Hmm, perhaps it's a five-membered ring? No, maybe a six-membered ring with some substituents. Let me try to write the SMILES properly:\n\nThe part after Cc2 is cc(N)nc(F)c2F. Let's break it down:\n\n- c2 is the starting aromatic carbon (position 1).\n- Then comes c (position 2), which is connected to another c (position 3) with substituent N.\n- Then position 4 is n (aromatic nitrogen), followed by c (position 5) with F substituent.\n- Then back to c2 (position 6) with F substituent.\n\nWait, that's a six-membered ring: positions 1 (c2), 2 (c), 3 (c with N), 4 (n), 5 (c with F), 6 (c2 with F). But SMILES notation wraps around, so maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents. The key point is the 'N' in position 3. Since it's written as 'N' in lowercase letters, but aromatic contexts use lowercase for carbon and nitrogen. Wait, no: lowercase 'n' is aromatic nitrogen. So 'N' in uppercase would be an aliphatic amine. Wait, no. In SMILES, uppercase 'N' denotes an aliphatic nitrogen atom (with implicit hydrogens), while lowercase 'n' denotes an aromatic nitrogen. So in the input molecule, the part 'cc(N)' would be an aliphatic NH2 group attached to an aromatic carbon. Wait, but that's not possible. Because 'cc(N)' would mean that the nitrogen is attached to an aromatic carbon. But aromatic carbons are lowercase 'c', and if you attach an aliphatic N (uppercase) to it, that would create a substituent. So the 'N' in 'cc(N)' would be an NH2 group attached to the aromatic ring. Because in SMILES, when you have an uppercase N attached to an aromatic carbon, it's considered as a substituent, not part of the aromatic ring. So that 'N' would be a primary amine group (-NH2) attached to the benzene ring.\n\nSo in the input molecule, there's one occurrence of 'N' in the SMILES, which is in the 'cc(N)' part. Let me check the entire SMILES again to make sure there are no other 'N's. The input molecule is:\n\nCc1cc(C#N)cc(C(=O)c2c(C(C)C)c(=O)[nH]c(=O)n2Cc2cc(N)nc(F)c2F)c1\n\nLooking for uppercase 'N's:\n\n- C#N: that's a nitrile group, not an amine.\n- [nH]: that's an aromatic nitrogen with one hydrogen (part of a ring, so not a primary amine).\n- The 'N' in cc(N): that's the primary amine.\n- Are there any other N's? Let's see: n2 (lowercase, aromatic), nc(F) (lowercase n, aromatic), and the other parts don't have uppercase N's. So only one occurrence of 'N' in the SMILES, which would correspond to a primary amine group (-NH2).\n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.",

The fragment SMILES is -CF3, which means a carbon connected to three fluorine atoms. But in SMILES notation, the hyphen usually indicates a bond to another atom. So the fragment is a CF3 group attached to something else.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, I'll break it down. The main structure seems to have a benzene ring (the 'c1cc...' parts). There's an Nc3ccc(...) part, which is an aniline group. The part inside the parentheses after C is (F)(F)F, which is a carbon attached to three fluorines. So that's C(F)(F)F, which is CF3. \n\nSo in the SMILES string, there's a part: C(F)(F)F. That's the CF3 group. Now, how many times does this occur? Let me check the entire SMILES.

So there's only one instance of the trifluoromethyl group here. \n\nWait, could there be another CF3 elsewhere? Let me go through the SMILES again.

The input molecule's SMILES is CCOC(=O)C1(C(=O)NC(Cc2ccc(-c3ccccc3OC)cc2)C(=O)O)CCCO1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the ethoxy group looks like. The SMILES for the fragment is -OEt, which I think is an ethoxy group attached to something else. The \"-\" indicates the point of attachment. So, ethoxy is -OCH2CH3, right? So in the molecule, I'm looking for any occurrences where an oxygen is connected to an ethyl group (CH2CH3) and that oxygen is attached to another part of the molecule.\n\nLooking at the input SMILES: Let's break it down. Starting with CCOC(=O)... So the first part is CCO-, which is ethoxy attached to a carbonyl group (C(=O)). Then there's a more complex structure with a cyclic ester or something. Let me parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nThe main chain starts with CCOC(=O)C1(...)CCCO1. The \"C1(...)CCCO1\" part suggests a cyclic structure where the 1 is the ring closure. So the ring has four carbons (CCCO) plus the C1. Wait, the ring would be a five-membered ring? Let me count: C1 is connected to the carbonyl, then the ring has C, C, C, O, and back to C1. So it's a five-membered ring, maybe a tetrahydrofuran derivative?\n\nBut focusing on the ethoxy groups. The initial part is CCOC(=O)... which is ethyl oxy (ethoxy) attached to a carbonyl. That's one ethoxy group. Now, looking further into the molecule, there's a part that says -c3ccccc3OC. Wait, that's a benzene ring (c3ccccc3) with an OC attached. The OC here would be OCH3? No, wait, the SMILES is OC attached to the benzene. So that's -O-C connected to the benzene. But the ethyl group comes from where? Let me check again. The fragment is -OEt, which is -OCH2CH3.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES again: The main chain starts with CCOC(=O)... so that's ethoxy (OCH2CH3) attached to the carbonyl. Then later, there's a part: -c3ccccc3OC. Wait, the OC here is attached to the benzene ring. The benzene is part of a substituent: -c3ccccc3OC. So the benzene has a substituent which is -OC. But OC in SMILES would be O-C, so that's methoxy (OCH3) if it's connected to a methyl group. Wait, no, because the C here is part of the substituent. Let me parse that part again. The substituent is -c3ccccc3OC. So the benzene (c3ccccc3) is connected via a single bond to OC. Wait, the OC is part of the substituent. The OC would be O-C, but where is the C connected? Let me try writing that part. The benzene ring is c3ccccc3, and then there's a -O-C group attached. But the C after O would need to have more connections. Maybe that's part of another group. Wait, looking at the entire SMILES string: ...Cc2ccc(-c3ccccc3OC)cc2)...\n\nBreaking that down: The part after NC(...) is C(Cc2ccc(...)cc2). So the Cc2ccc(...)cc2 is a benzyl group attached to another carbon. The c2ccc(...)cc2 is a benzene ring where one of the positions is substituted with -c3ccccc3OC. So that substituent is another benzene ring (c3ccccc3) connected via a single bond to OC. Wait, that would be a benzene ring attached to an oxygen which is attached to a carbon. But OC without any other connections would imply a methoxy group, but the substituent is -c3ccccc3OC. So the substituent is a benzene (c3ccccc3) connected to O-C. But then the C after O must be connected elsewhere. Wait, perhaps I'm misparsing the SMILES. Let's look again: ...-c3ccccc3OC... So after the benzene ring (c3ccccc3), there's an O followed by a C. But in SMILES, the order matters. So the substituent is attached to the benzene ring (c3) via a single bond to O, which is connected to a C. So that would be O-C, but what's attached to that C? If it's OC with no other atoms, that might be a methyl group (OCH3). Wait, but the C here is part of the substituent. Let me think: the substituent is -c3ccccc3OC. So the benzene ring (c3) is connected to O, which is connected to C. But then where is that C connected? It could be that the C is part of another group. Wait, maybe the OC is part of a larger structure. Let me see the entire SMILES again:\n\nInput Molecule: CCOC(=O)C1(C(=O)NC(Cc2ccc(-c3ccccc3OC)cc2)C(=O)O)CCCO1\n\nThe part in question is the substituent on the benzene ring (c2ccc(-c3ccccc3OC)cc2). The -c3ccccc3OC is a substituent on the c2 benzene. So breaking that down: the substituent is a benzene ring (c3ccccc3) connected via a single bond to O, which is connected to C. But what's attached to that C? If the C is just a single atom here, then it would be a methyl group (O-C), making it a methoxy group. But wait, the SMILES here is written as -c3ccccc3OC. So the benzene ring is attached to O, which is attached to C. But the C might be connected to something else. However, looking at the entire SMILES, after OC, there's the rest of the molecule: ...OC)cc2)C(=O)O)CCCO1. So the C after O in OC is part of the substituent and isn't connected to anything else except the O and possibly another group. Wait, perhaps there's a typo here. Alternatively, maybe the OC is part of a larger group. Wait, perhaps the OC is actually O-C with the C being part of another chain. Let me try to parse the entire substituent again.\n\nThe substituent is -c3ccccc3OC. So it's a benzene ring (c3ccccc3) attached to O, which is attached to C. But then, the C would need to have more bonds. Since in SMILES, each atom must have the correct valence. Carbon has four bonds. So the C after O in OC must have three more bonds. However, in the given SMILES, after OC, the next character is ), which closes the substituent. So perhaps the C is connected to something else. Wait, maybe the C is part of a carbonyl group or another structure. Wait, the SMILES is ...-c3ccccc3OC)cc2)... So the OC is followed by a closing parenthesis, which suggests that the C is part of the substituent. But that C would need more bonds. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the SMILES notation here. Alternatively, maybe the OC is actually part of a methoxy group. Let's consider that. If the substituent is -c3ccccc3OCH3, then the SMILES would be written as -c3ccccc3OC. But wait, OC would be O followed by a carbon with three hydrogens (methyl group), making it OCH3. But in SMILES, that would be written as O-C, but the C would need to have three more Hs. However, in SMILES, if a carbon is written as C without any branches, it's assumed to have enough hydrogens to satisfy valence. So OC would be O-C, which is a methyl group attached to oxygen, i.e., methoxy (OCH3). But the fragment we're looking for is ethoxy (-OCH2CH3). So in the substituent -c3ccccc3OC, that would be a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring, not ethoxy. Therefore, that part is methoxy, not ethoxy.\n\nSo, going back to the input molecule. The first part is CCOC(=O)... which is ethoxy (OCH2CH3) attached to a carbonyl. Then, looking elsewhere in the molecule, are there any other ethoxy groups? Let's check the rest of the SMILES. After the cyclic part (CCCO1), is there another ethoxy group? The rest of the molecule is the cyclic ester part. The substituents on the benzene ring are methoxy, as we determined. So the only ethoxy group is the initial CCO- part. Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Are there any other ethyl-O groups? Let's look again. The SMILES is CCOC(=O)C1(...)CCCO1. The CCO- is ethoxy. Then, in the cyclic part (C1(...)CCCO1), the ring is a five-membered ring: C1 connected to the carbonyl, then three carbons (C, C, C), then O, and back to C1. So the ring is O in the fifth position. The substituents on the ring might be other groups. The part inside the C1(...) is (C(=O)NC(...)C(=O)O). So there's another carbonyl group and an amide group. But I don't see any other ethoxy groups here. The only O connected to ethyl is the initial CCO-.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.",

So the SMILES for ethoxy would be OCC, where the oxygen is connected to the ethyl group.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, the beginning part is CCOC(=O).

Let's go through the rest of the SMILES. After the carbonyl, there's a c1cc2cc(...)ccc2[nH]1. That looks like a bicyclic system, maybe indole or similar. Inside that, there's a C3(Cc4ccccc4)CCNC3 part. This seems like a cyclohexane or similar ring with substituents.

The rest of the molecule has oxygen only in the carbonyl (O=C) and the [nH] which is a nitrogen. There's another O in the carbonyl, but that's part of the ester group, not an ethoxy.

Breaking down the SMILES:\n\n- COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1C(=O)OCCN1CCC(C(N)=O)CC1\n\nStarting from the left, there's a methoxy group (CO-) attached to a benzene ring. The ring has substituents: an amino group (N), a chlorine (Cl), and a carbonyl group (C(=O)O...). The carbonyl is connected to an oxygen, then a chain: OCCN... So after the carbonyl, it's O-C-C-N, which is part of a cyclohexane ring (CCC(C(N)=O)CC1). Wait, the part after C(=O)O is OCCN1CCC...

In SMILES notation, this would be something like OC(=O)O-R, but more accurately, the ester functional group is usually written as COO-R, so the carbonyl is adjacent to the oxygen connected to the R group.

The general structure for an ester is RCOOR', where the carbonyl (C=O) is connected to an oxygen that's connected to an R' group. So in SMILES, that would be C(=O)O-R, which is written as COOR.

That would make this part an ester group. Because the structure is O-C(=O)-... but connected to an ethyl group (CCO-). So that's an ester: the ethyl ester of a carboxylic acid. So that's one occurrence of the ester group.\n\nNow, checking the rest of the molecule. The rest of the SMILES after the initial part is c1c(S(=O)(=O)NCC(=O)Nc2cc(C)ccc2C)c(C)n(C)c1C. Let's parse this. The 'c' indicates aromatic carbons. Let's see if there are any other ester groups here. The part after the first carbonyl is S(=O)(=O)NCC(=O)Nc2... So here, there's a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), then NCC(=O)N... That's a urea group: the NCC(=O)N suggests a urea linkage, where the carbonyl is part of a urea (N-C(=O)-N). Then there's another carbonyl (=O) in the urea part, but that's part of the urea, not an ester. So that's a carbonyl but not an ester.\n\nLooking further, are there any other OC(=O) groups? The initial part was CCOC(=O), which is the ester. The rest of the molecule has a sulfonyl group, a urea, and some aromatic rings with substituents like methyl groups (C), but I don't see any other OC(=O) groups. The only other carbonyl is in the urea (NCC(=O)N), which is part of the urea, not an ester.\n\nSo, the count should be 1. The molecule has one ester group at the beginning, the ethyl ester.",

Starting with the first ring: Cc1c(...)c(=O)oc2cc(...)ccc12. The second part is Cc2cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c2, which is a benzene ring with a nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]).

Let me see. The nitro group has two oxygen atoms attached to the nitrogen. The fragment is a nitrogen double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to another oxygen. However, in the nitro group, both oxygens are attached via double bonds (but actually, nitro groups are resonance structures). However, in the SMILES notation, the nitro is written as [N+](=O)[O-], which would have one double bond and one single bond (with charges). So the structure would be O=N+-O-. \n\nSo the fragment =N-O would correspond to a nitrogen double-bonded to an oxygen and single-bonded to another oxygen.

That's an ester group where the oxygen is connected to a carbonyl, then an N(C)C (dimethylamide). The amide is N connected to two methyl groups and a carbonyl. But in that case, the nitrogen is single-bonded to the carbonyl, not double-bonded. So there's no =N-O there. The other parts are aromatic rings and ester groups. So the only occurrence is in the nitro group.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 1. Wait, but the nitro group has both the double bond and the single bond to O.

Wait, but in the nitro group, it's [N+](=O)[O-], which would have two oxygen atoms attached. So the fragment =N-O would be a different structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is part of an oxime. Oximes are usually R2C=N-OH. So the N is double-bonded to C, and single-bonded to O. But the SMILES for that would be N-O, but with the double bond. Wait, in SMILES notation, the double bond would be specified. For example, C=N-O. So the fragment given here is =N-O, which suggests that the N is part of a double bond (like =N-O-). But that's not a typical oxime structure. \n\nWait, maybe the fragment is looking for any occurrence where N is double-bonded to something and connected to an O. Let me look at the input molecule. Let's parse the SMILES again:\n\nCOC(=O)C1=C(C)N=C(C)C(=C(O)OC)C1c1ccc(Cl)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- COC(=O): methyl carbonate maybe? O-Me-O-C(=O)\n- Then C1=C(C)N=C(C)... So the cyclohexene ring starts here. The positions are 1 and 3? Let me draw it mentally. The ring is six-membered? The structure is C1=C(C)N=C(C)... So the ring is possibly a six-membered ring with substituents. \n\nWait, the entire SMILES is COC(=O)C1=C(C)N=C(C)C(=C(O)OC)C1c1ccc(Cl)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1. So after the initial COC(=O), there's a C1 which is part of a ring. The structure is C1=C(C)N=C(C)... followed by C(=C(O)OC), then the ring closure C1, then another benzene ring: c1ccc(Cl)c([N+](=O)[O-])c1.\n\nSo the main ring (the first C1) is a six-membered ring with substituents. Let me try to reconstruct the structure:\n\nThe first ring is C1 connected as follows:\n\n- Position 1: C(=O)OCH3 (from the initial COC(=O))\n- Position 2: C(C) (from C1=C(C))\n- Position 3: N (from N=C(C)...)\n- Position 4: C(C)\n- Position 5: C(=C(O)OC)\n- Position 6: ?\n\nWait, maybe the ring is a benzene ring? Or a cyclohexene? Because there's a C=C in the ring. Let's see: C1=C(C)N=C(C)C(=C(O)OC)C1. So the ring is C1=C(C)\u2013N=C(C)\u2013C(=C(O)OC)\u2013C1. That makes a six-membered ring with double bonds between C1 and C2 (C=C), between C3 (N) and C4 (C), and between C5 and C6 (C(=C...)). Wait, that might not be possible because SMILES notation requires alternating double bonds. So maybe the ring has conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, but assuming the SMILES is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the key part to look at is the nitro group in the benzene ring at the end: c([N+](=O)[O-])c1. That's the nitro group attached to the benzene ring. The nitro group here is [N+](=O)[O-], which is the typical structure for a nitro group. \n\nNow, the fragment SMILES is =N-O. Let's see if this occurs in the molecule. The nitro group has N with a double bond to O and a single bond to another O (but charged). The fragment is =N-O, which would imply a double bond between N and O, then a single bond to another O. However, in the nitro group, the structure is N with a double bond to O and another O with a negative charge. The SMILES for the nitro group is [N+](=O)[O-]. So in this case, the N is connected to two O atoms: one double-bonded and one single-bonded (but with charges). The fragment =N-O would match part of this structure if we ignore the charges. However, the fragment doesn't include the charges, so maybe it's looking for the N double-bonded to O and connected to another O. But in the nitro group, that's exactly what's happening. However, the SMILES for the fragment is =N-O. Let's see: in the nitro group, the N is connected to O via a double bond and another O via a single bond (but as part of the [N+] group). So the sequence would be N(=O)-O-. But in the SMILES, it's written as [N+](=O)[O-], which implies that the N is positively charged, and the O is negatively charged. \n\nBut the fragment SMILES is =N-O. Does that match any part of the molecule? Let's check the input molecule for any N connected via a double bond to O and then to another O. The nitro group has N with double bond to O and single bond to O-, but with charges. The fragment doesn't include charges, so maybe the charges are ignored? But in SMILES matching, the charges are part of the structure. So the fragment =N-O would not match the nitro group's [N+](=O)[O-] because of the charges. \n\nAre there any other parts of the molecule with =N-O? Let's look again. The input molecule has an N in the ring: ...C1=C(C)N=C(C)... So here, the N is part of the ring. The SMILES here is N=C(C), so the N is double-bonded to C. So that's an imine group, perhaps. But that's N=C, not N-O. \n\nThe rest of the molecule: the COC(=O) group is an ester, the C(=C(O)OC) is another substituted group. The benzene ring has Cl and the nitro group. \n\nSo the only place where N is connected to O is in the nitro group. But the fragment SMILES is =N-O. Since the nitro group's N is connected to O via a double bond and another O via a single bond (with charges), but the fragment doesn't have charges, does that count? \n\nIn SMILES substructure matching, charges are important. So unless the fragment includes the charges, it won't match. The fragment SMILES here is =N-O, which is neutral. The nitro group in the molecule is [N+](=O)[O-], which is charged. Therefore, the fragment =N-O would not match the nitro group in the molecule. \n\nTherefore, there are zero occurrences of the fragment =N-O in the input molecule. \n\nWait, but the fragment name is oximes. Oximes are R2C=N-OH. So the structure is a C=N-OH group. Let me check if the molecule has any oxime groups. Looking at the input SMILES again: the N in the ring is part of N=C(C), which is an imine (C=N-C), but there's no hydroxyl group attached to the N. The nitro group is a nitro, not an oxime. \n\nSo the molecule doesn't have any oxime groups. Therefore, the count should be 0.",

Let's break it down step by step. The molecule starts with CNC, which is methyl (CH3), then a nitrogen connected to a CH2 group (since it's N-C-C).

I need to check if there are any other instances of this group besides the one at the end. Let me go through the SMILES again. The main parts are the cyclohexane ring with some substituents. The part after the oxygen is another benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to the C#N. Let me check the substituents on the cyclohexane ring. There's a C(=O)N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2 group. Breaking that down: the carbonyl (C=O) is connected to a nitrogen (N2), which is part of a ring? Wait, the notation is N2 followed by CCCN(...)CC2. So that's a piperazine-like ring? Let me see: N2 connected to C-C-C-N, which has a substituent (C3CC3), which is a cyclopropane ring attached to the nitrogen. Then back to CC2. So the structure here is a piperazine ring with a cyclopropyl group attached to one of the nitrogens. But in that part, I don't see any C#N groups. The only C#N is at the end of the second benzene ring. \n\nWait, the input molecule's SMILES ends with C#N, so that's one cyano group. Are there any others? Let me check the rest. The beginning part has CNC, which is a methyl group attached to a nitrogen, but that's -NH-CH3, not a cyano. The cyclohexane ring has substituents, but the substituents are a carbonyl group connected to an amine ring. No cyano groups there. The other benzene ring (after O) has the C#N at the end.

The group is a ring: the c2cnc...o2 part. Let's parse that: c2 is a carbon connected to the benzene ring. Then there's a nitrogen (n), another carbon (c), and then (C3CC3), which is a cyclopropyl group. Wait, the C3CC3 is part of the substituent on that carbon? So the structure is a ring where one of the atoms is connected to a cyclopropyl group. Hmm.\n\nWait, the substituent is -c2cnc(C3CC3)o2. Let's break that down. The c2 is connected to the benzene ring via a single bond (the hyphen). Then the c2 is part of a ring: c2cnc...o2. So the ring is a five-membered ring? Let me count: c2 (position 1), n (position 2), c (position 3), then there's a bond to (C3CC3), which is a cyclopropane. Wait, maybe the structure is a oxazole ring or something similar.

So the structure is Ar-SO2-NH- where the NH is connected to another group. Wait, no. Let me look again. The SMILES starts with NS(=O)(=O)c..., so the nitrogen is directly attached to the sulfur (S), which has two double-bonded oxygens. The nitrogen (N) is also connected to the benzene ring (c1ccc...). So the sulfonamide group here is N-SO2- attached to the benzene. But for it to be a primary sulfonamide (-SO2NH2), the nitrogen should have two hydrogens. However, in this structure, the nitrogen is connected to the sulfur and the benzene ring. That's only two substituents. Wait, nitrogen typically has three bonds. So if the nitrogen is bonded to S and the benzene ring, then there's one more bond. That would be a hydrogen, making it NH. But primary sulfonamide is -SO2NH2, meaning the nitrogen has two hydrogens. So in this case, the nitrogen has two substituents (S and benzene) and one hydrogen, making it a secondary amine, not primary. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nA primary sulfonamide would have the structure R-SO2-NH2, where the nitrogen is attached to the sulfonyl group and two hydrogens. If the nitrogen is attached to the sulfonyl group and another carbon (like benzene here), then it's R-SO2-NH-R', which would be a secondary sulfonamide. But in the input molecule, the SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)c..., meaning the nitrogen (N) is connected to S and then to the benzene (c...). So the nitrogen has two substituents: S and benzene. But nitrogen has a valence of three, so there must be a hydrogen as well. So the group is -SO2-NH- attached to the benzene. That makes it a secondary sulfonamide, not primary. Therefore, the fragment -SO2NH2 (primary) is not present here. Wait, but the fragment given is \"-SO2NH2\". So maybe I'm misunderstanding the SMILES.\n\nWait, the fragment SMILES is \"-SO2NH2\". The hyphen indicates the attachment point. So the fragment is a sulfonamide where the nitrogen is connected to the rest of the molecule. So in the input molecule, the part NS(=O)(=O)c... would be the sulfonamide group: the S is connected to two O (as =O), the N, and then the benzene. The N here has only one hydrogen (since it's connected to S and benzene), making it a secondary sulfonamide (SO2NHR), not primary (SO2NH2). Therefore, the count should be zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing another part of the molecule. Let me check the entire SMILES again. The input molecule is NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Nc2nccc(-c3ccc(NC(=O)Cc4cccs4)cc3)n2)cc1. Starting from the N attached to S, then the benzene ring. The benzene has a substituent at the para position (since the c1ccc(...)cc1 is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 4; wait, SMILES notation builds rings, so let's parse it step by step.\n\nThe main benzene ring is c1ccc(...)cc1. The first part is NS(=O)(=O) connected to position 1 of the benzene. Then, the benzene has a substituent at position 4 (since the fourth atom is the next connection): Nc2nccc(...)n2. That's a pyridine ring (n2) connected via N to the benzene. The pyridine ring (positions c2nccc(...)n2) has a substituent at position 4 (the fourth atom in the pyridine ring, which is a carbon connected to -c3ccc(...)cc3). That's another benzene ring connected via a single bond. This benzene (c3) has a substituent NC(=O)Cc4cccs4. Let's break that down: NC(=O)Cc4cccs4. The N here is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), then a CH2 group connected to a thiophene ring (c4cccs4). \n\nSo in this entire structure, the only sulfonamide group is the one at the beginning: NS(=O)(=O)c... which is a secondary sulfonamide (since the N is attached to S and benzene, plus one H), not a primary one. The other nitrogen-containing groups are anilines (N attached to benzene), amides (NC=O), and the pyridine ring. \n\nTherefore, the fragment \"-SO2NH2\" (primary sulfonamide) is not present in the input molecule. Hence, the count should be 0.",

The input molecule's SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)CN2CCN(c3ccccc3)CC2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let me write it out step by step. The SMILES starts with N connected to S, which has two double bonds to O (S(=O)(=O)). Then there's a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1). Attached to the benzene ring is a group: NC(=O)CN2CCN(c3ccccc3)CC2. So, the sulfonamide part is the NS(=O)(=O) group.\n\nWait, the fragment is -SO2NH2. The primary sulfonamide group is where the sulfur is connected to two oxygens (as SO2) and an NH2 group. In the input molecule, the S is connected to two O's via double bonds and an NH group (since it's NS(=O)(=O)...). Wait, the S is attached to an N. So the structure is N-SO2. But the fragment is SO2NH2. So the question is, does the input molecule have a sulfonamide group where the S is connected to an NH2?\n\nLooking at the input SMILES: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc... So the S is connected to an N, which is part of the benzene ring. The N attached to S has only one hydrogen? Because in the SMILES notation, if it's just N without branching, it's NH. So the group here is -N(H)-S(=O)(=O)-. So the sulfonamide here is -N-SO2-, but the fragment is -SO2-NH2. So in the input, the NH is part of the ring's substituent, not a free NH2. Therefore, the primary sulfonamide would require that the SO2 is directly attached to an NH2 group. But in this case, the NH is connected to the benzene ring, so it's more like a secondary sulfonamide, not primary. Because a primary sulfonamide would have SO2NH2 where the NH2 is a terminal group. Here, the N is connected to the S and also to the benzene ring, making it a secondary amine. Therefore, the count should be zero.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the fragment. Let me check the fragment SMILES again: -SO2NH2. The SMILES would be written as S(=O)(=O)N. But in the input molecule, the S is connected to N, which is attached to the benzene ring. So the structure is benzene-SO2-NH-...? Wait, the input molecule's SMILES starts with NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc..., so the N is directly attached to the S, and the S is attached to the benzene ring (c1...). So the group is N-SO2-benzene. The N here has one hydrogen (since it's written as N, not [NH2] or something). So the group is -N(H)-SO2- attached to the benzene. That would be a sulfonamide, but it's a secondary sulfonamide because the nitrogen is connected to two carbons (the benzene ring and the sulfur). A primary sulfonamide would have the nitrogen connected only to the sulfur and two hydrogens (NH2). Therefore, in this molecule, there's no primary sulfonamide group. Hence, the count is zero.",

The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and substituents. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the left: CC12CCN... So there's a cyclopropane ring (C1 and C2) with substituents. The main chain includes a CCN group attached to a carbonyl (C(=O)). Then there's a cyclohexane ring (C3CCC...CC3) where one of the carbons is substituted with a C(=O)O group. Wait, that's the carboxylic acid fragment.

Hmm, the molecule has a central structure with various substituents. Let's look for the carboxylic acid group, which is -C(=O)O. The SMILES for that fragment is \"-C(=O)O\", so the group is a carbonyl (C=O) connected to an oxygen (O).

Either way, the key part is the C(=O)O group.\n\nNow, I'll go through the input SMILES step by step. The molecule starts with O=C(N..., which is an amide group (O=C-N).

So the N is connected to the carbonyl and to a carbon that has a methyl. The fragment in question is -NC(=O)CH3. So in the fragment, the N is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and a methyl group (CH3). Comparing that to the input molecule's part, the N is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and a C(CH3). Wait, the fragment's methyl is directly attached to the N? No, the fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. So the N is connected to the carbonyl group (C=O), which is connected to CH3. So the structure is N-C(=O)-CH3. In the input molecule, the part is C(=O)-N-C(CH3). So the N is connected to the C(=O) and to a C(CH3). But the fragment's structure is N-C(=O)-CH3, meaning the N is attached to the carbonyl and a methyl. But in the input molecule, the N is attached to the carbonyl and a C(CH3), which is a different structure. Therefore, that part of the input molecule does not match the fragment.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look elsewhere. Let's look at the entire SMILES string: CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N(C)CC4CCOC4)ncc3Cl)C2)cc1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CC(=O)NC(C): The first part is CH3-C(=O)-N-C(CH3)-...\nThen there's a benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1) with substituents. One of the substituents is O-C2CCN(...)C2. The O connects to a cyclohexane-like ring (C2CCN...C2), but it's a 3-membered ring? Wait, SMILES notation for rings uses numbers. The OC2CCN(...)C2 part: O connected to C2, which is part of a ring. Let me parse that. The O is connected to a carbon (C2), which is part of a chain: C-C-C-N(...) and then back to C2. So it's a four-membered ring: O-C2-C-C-N(...)-C2? That would make a ring with four atoms: O-C2-C-C-N-C2? No, because the ring closure is between the first C2 and the last C2. Wait, the SMILES is OC2CCN(...)C2. So the O is connected to C2. Then C2 is connected to C, then C connected to N. Then the N has a substituent (c3...), and then the ring closes back to C2. So the ring is O-C2-C-C-N-C2, forming a five-membered ring? Wait, C2 is the first atom after O. Then C connected to C, then C connected to N, then N connected to C2 again. So the ring has four atoms: O-C2-C-C-N and then back to C2? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a four-membered ring: O-C2-C-C-N, but the ring closure is between N and C2. Wait, the SMILES is OC2CCN(...)C2. So the O is connected to C2. Then C2 is connected to C, then C connected to another C (since \"CCN\"), then N. Then the N has some substituents, and then the C2 at the end closes the ring. So the ring would be O-C2-C-C-N-C2. That's a five-membered ring? O, C2, C, C, N, and back to C2. Wait, but C2 is the second carbon in the ring. So the ring would be O-C2-C-C-N-C2. That's five atoms: O, C2, C, C, N. Wait, no: O is the first atom, then C2 (second), then C (third), C (fourth), N (fifth), and then back to C2 (second). So the ring would be O-C2-C-C-N-C2. That's a five-membered ring? But the numbering would be O (1), C2 (2), C (3), C (4), N (5), and then back to C2 (2). That's a bit confusing. Maybe I should not get stuck here and focus back on the fragment.\n\nThe fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. So the structure is a nitrogen connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) which is connected to a methyl group (CH3). The hyphen at the start indicates that this fragment is attached to something else via the nitrogen's remaining bond. So the nitrogen in the fragment has two substituents: the carbonyl and the methyl, and one bond to the rest of the molecule.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, the first part is CC(=O)NC(C)... The acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-) is attached to an NH group (the N here is connected to the C(=O) and then to a C(C) (a carbon attached to a methyl). So the structure here is CH3-C(=O)-N-C(CH3)-... The nitrogen here is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and a C(CH3). But the fragment's nitrogen is connected to C(=O) and CH3. So in this part of the molecule, the nitrogen has a CH3 attached via a carbon (C(CH3)), not directly. Therefore, this part does not match the fragment.\n\nLooking elsewhere in the molecule: the part after the benzene ring is OC2CCN(c3nc(N(C)CC4CCOC4)ncc3Cl)C2. The N in the middle of this part (CCN(...)) is part of the ring. Let's see: the N here has a substituent which is c3nc(...). So the N is connected to the ring (c3...). The substituent on the N is a heterocycle: c3nc(N(...)...)ncc3Cl. Breaking that down: c3 is a benzene ring where position 1 is connected to N, position 2 is c (carbon), position 3 is nc(...), etc. Wait, perhaps it's a pyridine ring or similar. Let's parse the substituent on the N in the ring: c3nc(N(C)CC4CCOC4)ncc3Cl. This part is a benzene ring (c3) with substituents: n (nitrogen) at position 1, c (carbon) at position 2 connected to N(C)..., another nitrogen at position 3 (n), etc. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pyridine ring with substituents. But maybe focusing on the N(C) part: N(C)CC4CCOC4. That's a N connected to a C (which is part of a group: C connected to C-C4CCOC4. Wait, the SMILES here is N(C)CC4CCOC4. So the N is connected to a methyl group (C), then two Cs (CC), then a ring closure (4) which is part of a CCOC ring. So CC4CCOC4 would form a five-membered ring: the first C is connected to the second C (CC), then the second C is connected to O (C-O), then O connected to C (O-C), then back to the fourth C (C4). So the ring is C-C-O-C-C4, forming a five-membered ring (tetrahydrofuran-like, but with an extra carbon?). Wait, the SMILES is CC4CCOC4. Let's break it down:\n\n- The first C is connected to the second C (CC).\n- The second C is connected to O (C-O).\n- O is connected to another C (O-C).\n- That C is connected back to the fourth C (C4), which is the same as the first C in the ring. So the ring is C-C-O-C-C4, which is a five-membered ring? Wait, no: the sequence is C-C-O-C connected back to the fourth C. Wait, maybe the ring is four-membered? Let me count:\n\nStarting with C4, the sequence is C4-C-C-O-C-C4. Wait, no. The SMILES is CC4CCOC4. So the first C is connected to C4. Then C4 is connected to C, which is connected to O, which is connected to C, which is connected back to C4. So the ring is C4-C-O-C-C4, forming a five-membered ring? Wait, C4 connected to C (1st), then C connected to O (2nd), O connected to C (3rd), which is connected back to C4 (4th). Wait, that's a four-membered ring: C4-C-O-C-C4. Wait, that's five atoms: C4, C, O, C, and then back to C4. So it's a five-membered ring? No, because the ring closure is between the last C and C4, making it a four-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Regardless, the key part is the N(C) group. The N here is connected to a methyl (C), and then a chain leading to the ring. So the structure here is N(CH2CH2O...), but that's not directly relevant to the fragment we're looking for.\n\nBack to the fragment: looking for instances where a nitrogen is connected to a carbonyl (C=O) and a methyl group (CH3). In the input molecule, the only place where a carbonyl is present is at the beginning: CC(=O)N... So that's the acetyl group. The N here is part of an amide. But the N is connected to the carbonyl and a C(CH3). So the substituents on the N are the carbonyl group and a C(CH3). Therefore, that's not the same as the fragment, which requires the N to be connected to a methyl (CH3) directly. Wait, the fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. So the N is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and a CH3. In the input molecule's first part, the N is connected to the carbonyl and a C(CH3). So the substituent here is a secondary carbon (with a methyl group), but the fragment's substituent is a methyl group directly attached. Therefore, that part doesn't match.\n\nAre there any other carbonyl groups in the molecule? Let me check the input SMILES again: CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N(C)CC4CCOC4)ncc3Cl)C2)cc1. The only carbonyl is the CC(=O) part. The rest of the molecule includes an ester group (O-C...), but no other C=O groups. Therefore, the only carbonyl is in the acetyl group. So the only possible place where the fragment could be is the acetylated amide at the beginning. But as discussed, the N there is connected to a C(CH3), not a CH3. Therefore, the fragment does not appear in the input molecule. Wait, but wait: the fragment is written as -NC(=O)CH3, which could be part of a larger structure. Let me check the exact connectivity. The hyphen at the start indicates that the fragment is connected via the N's remaining bond. So the fragment is N-C(=O)-CH3, with the N having one bond to the rest of the molecule. In the input molecule, the N is connected to the C(=O) and to a C(CH3). So the substituents on N are C(=O) and C(CH3). The fragment requires the substituents to be C(=O) and CH3. Since in the input, it's C(CH3) instead of CH3, that's different. Therefore, there is no occurrence of the fragment in the input molecule.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a case where the C(CH3) is considered as part of the fragment? No, because the fragment specifies CH3 directly attached to the N. The C(CH3) is a different structure. Therefore, the count should be zero.",

I need to find out how many times the fragment \"-NC(=O)CH3\" appears in the input molecule \"CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2)cc1\". \n\nFirst, I should parse the input molecule's SMILES to understand its structure. The molecule starts with CC(=O)NC(C)... So the first part is CC(=O) which is an acetyl group. Then there's NC(C), which is a methyl group attached to a nitrogen. Wait, the fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. Let me compare.\n\nThe fragment has an amide group: the nitrogen connected to a carbonyl (C=O) and a methyl group (CH3). So the structure is N-C(=O)-CH3. In the input molecule, the beginning is CC(=O)NC(C)... So the acetyl group (C(=O)CH3) is attached to a nitrogen. Wait, the SMILES here is CC(=O)NC(C). That would be CH3-C(=O)-N-C(C)... So the nitrogen here is connected to the carbonyl (from the acetyl) and a methyl group (the C(C)). Wait, no, the C(C) would be a carbon attached to another carbon. Let me draw this out.\n\nThe SMILES CC(=O)NC(C) breaks down as:\n\n- C: a methyl group (CH3)\n- C(=O): carbonyl group\n- N: nitrogen attached to the carbonyl\n- C(C): a carbon connected to another carbon (so a CH2 group attached to another CH3?)\n\nWait, maybe the SMILES is written as CC(=O)NC(C). So the nitrogen has two substituents: the acetyl (from the CC(=O)) and the C(C) group. The C(C) would be a carbon connected to another carbon, which is a methyl group. So the nitrogen is connected to the acetyl (C(=O)CH3) and a CH(CH3) group? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, the C(C) could be a methyl group attached to the nitrogen. Wait, SMILES notation: each atom is followed by its bonds. So CC(=O)NC(C) would be:\n\n- First C: CH3\n- Connected to C(=O) (so CH3-C(=O)-)\n- Then N connected to that carbonyl C: so CH3-C(=O)-N-\n- Then C connected to the N: CH3-C(=O)-N-C\n- And that C has another C attached (the (C) part?), which would make it CH2-CH3? So the N is connected to a CH2CH3 group? Wait, no. The SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C). Let me parse it step by step.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. CC(=O): This is CH3-C(=O)-.\n2. Then comes N: so the carbonyl C is connected to N. So CH3-C(=O)-N.\n3. Then C(C): The N is connected to a C atom, which in turn is connected to another C. So the structure here is CH3-C(=O)-N-C-C. But how are the bonds arranged? The N is connected to the C (from C(=O)) and another C (from C(C)). Wait, maybe the C(C) is a branch. So the N has two substituents: the C(=O)CH3 and the C(C). The C(C) would be a carbon with another carbon attached. So that's a CH2 group connected to a CH3? So the N is connected to a CH2CH3 group? Or maybe it's a branched structure. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES is CC(=O)N(C)C... which would mean the N is connected to two C groups: the acetyl (from CC(=O)) and another C. Wait, the original input molecule is CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc... So after the N, there's a C(C), which is part of the main chain. So the N is connected to the C(=O) from the acetyl group and to a C which has another C attached. So maybe the N is connected to a CH(CH3) group? Because the C(C) would be a carbon with another carbon attached. So that would be CH(CH3). Wait, SMILES notation: C(C) means a carbon attached to another carbon. So the N is connected to a CH2 group? No, wait. Let's consider the SMILES as CC(=O)NC(C)\u2026 So the N is connected to the C(=O) group and then to another C, which has a branch (the (C) part). So the C after N is connected to another C. So the structure would be:\n\nCH3-C(=O)-N-C(C)-...\n\nSo the N is attached to two carbons: the C from the acetyl and another C which has a branch (the C in parentheses). Wait, no. The parentheses in SMILES denote branches. So NC(C) would be N connected to a C, and that C has another C attached. So the N is connected to a CH2 group (since the C after N is connected to another C). Wait, but the C after N would have two bonds: one to N and one to the other C. So that would be a CH2 group with another C (maybe a methyl group). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to parse it again.\n\nThe input molecule's SMILES is: CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2)cc1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CC(=O): Acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-)\n- N: connected to the carbonyl C\n- C(C): The N is connected to a C, which is connected to another C (the (C) part)\n- Then c1ccc(...)cc1: a benzene ring with substituents.\n\nSo the N in question here is part of an amide group: the acetyl (CH3-C(=O)-) is attached to N, which is also attached to a C(C) group. The C(C) would be a carbon connected to another carbon, making it a CH2CH3 group? Or maybe a branching point. Wait, perhaps the N is connected to two carbons: one from the acetyl and another from the C(C). So the structure would be:\n\nCH3-C(=O)-N-CH2-CH3? But the SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C). Hmm, maybe the C(C) is a methyl group attached to the N. So the N has two substituents: the acetyl (CH3-C(=O)-) and a methyl group (CH(CH3)?). Wait, no. If it's NC(C), then the N is bonded to a C, which is bonded to another C. So the structure would be N-C-C. But that would be a primary amine with a propyl group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the C(C) is part of a branch. Let's think of the entire molecule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the N is part of an amide group: the acetyl (CH3-C(=O)-) attached to N, which is also attached to a C(C) group. So the N is connected to the carbonyl, a C (from the C(C)), and maybe another group. Wait, in amides, the nitrogen is usually bonded to two carbons (if it's a secondary amide). So here, the N is connected to the carbonyl C, the C(C), and perhaps another hydrogen? Or maybe there's another substituent.\n\nBut let's get back to the fragment. The fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. So the structure is N connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) which is connected to a methyl group (CH3). So the fragment is an acetamide group: H2N-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no. The fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. So the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl carbon, which is connected to a methyl group. So the structure is N-C(=O)-CH3. That's an acetylated amine. So in the input molecule, we need to find how many times this fragment appears.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES: CC(=O)NC(C)... The CC(=O) is the acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-), then N, then C(C). So the N is connected to the acetyl group and a C(C) group. The fragment is N-C(=O)-CH3, so the N must be attached to the carbonyl (C=O) and a methyl (CH3). But in the input molecule, the N is attached to the acetyl (which has a methyl) and another C(C). Wait, the acetyl is CH3-C(=O)-, so the N is attached to the carbonyl. So the N is part of the amide group: the N is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and another carbon (C(C)). So the fragment we're looking for is where the N is connected to the carbonyl and a methyl group. But in the input molecule, the N is connected to the acetyl's carbonyl and another carbon (C(C)), which may or may not be a methyl.\n\nWait, the fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. So the N is bonded to the carbonyl (C=O) and to a methyl (CH3). In the input molecule, the N is bonded to the carbonyl (from the acetyl, which is CH3-C(=O)-) and to a C(C). So the question is: does the C(C) in the input molecule correspond to a methyl group?\n\nThe C(C) in the input's SMILES would be a carbon atom connected to another carbon. So the structure is N-C-C. But that would be an ethyl group if it's part of a chain. Wait, but in this case, maybe the C(C) is a branch. Let's look at the SMILES again: CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc...\n\nThe part after the N is C(C)c1ccc..., which suggests that the C after N is connected to another C (from the C(C)) and to the benzene ring (c1ccc...). So the structure is:\n\n- The N is connected to the acetyl (CH3-C(=O)-), then to a C which is connected to another C and to the benzene ring.\n\nSo the C after N is connected to two things: another C (from C(C)) and the benzene ring (c1...). So that would make the C after N have three bonds: one to N, one to the other C, and one to the benzene ring. Wait, but carbon can only have four bonds. Let me try to visualize:\n\nThe SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)c1...\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CC(=O): CH3-C(=O)-\n- N: connected to the C(=O)\n- C(C): The N is connected to a C, which is connected to another C (the (C) part)\n- c1...: Then this C is connected to the benzene ring (c1...)\n\nSo the structure after the N is:\n\nN-C(C)-c1...\n\nThe C after N is connected to N, another C (from the C(C)), and the benzene ring. That makes three bonds. So the fourth bond would be a hydrogen. So the structure would be N-C(CH2-?)... Wait, perhaps the C after N is CH2 connected to the benzene ring. But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should focus on the fragment.\n\nThe fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. So in the input molecule, the N is part of an amide group where it's connected to the carbonyl (from acetyl) and a methyl group. But in the input's SMILES, after the N, there's a C(C), which might not be a methyl. The C(C) could be a methyl group if the structure is N-C(CH3). Wait, but the SMILES notation for a methyl group attached to N would be N(C)C. For example, if the N is connected to two methyl groups, it would be N(C)(C). But in this case, the SMILES is NC(C). So the N is connected to a C which is connected to another C. So that's N-C-C. That would be an ethyl group attached to the N. But that's not a methyl. So the fragment we're looking for is where the N is connected to a methyl group, but in the input molecule, the N is connected to an ethyl group (maybe) or another structure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-examine the input molecule's structure. The SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(...)cc1. The part after the N is C(C)c1... So the N is connected to a carbon that is part of a benzene ring (c1) and another carbon (from C(C)). So the structure is:\n\nThe N is connected to the carbonyl group (from CC(=O)), and to a carbon that is connected to another carbon (C) and the benzene ring (c1). So the carbon attached to the N has two substituents: a carbon (from C(C)) and the benzene ring. That would make it a CH2 group if the other bonds are to N and the ring. Wait, but the carbon after N (let's call it C1) is connected to N, another C (C2), and the benzene ring. So C1 has three bonds: N, C2, and benzene. The fourth bond must be a hydrogen. So C1 is CH2 connected to C2. Then C2 is another carbon. If C2 is a methyl group, then C2 would be CH3. But the SMILES for C(C) is C(C), which would mean C1 is connected to C2. So the structure would be N-C1-C2, where C1 is connected to the benzene ring. But then C2 would have to have other bonds. Wait, maybe C2 is part of another branch. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the C(C) in the SMILES is a methyl group. Wait, in SMILES notation, a methyl group is written as C. But if it's part of a branch, like (C), then perhaps it's a substituent. For example, C(C) would mean a carbon connected to another carbon. So if the main chain is NC(C), then N connected to C, which is connected to another C. So N-C-C. But that's an ethyl group. Unless the second C is a branch. Wait, perhaps the SMILES is NC(C) meaning the N is connected to a carbon that has a methyl branch. For example, if it's N-C(-C)-..., then the carbon after N has a methyl group. So that would be N-C(CH3)-... So in that case, the N is connected to a carbon that has a methyl group and other substituents. \n\nWait, perhaps the C(C) in the SMILES is a carbon with a methyl branch. For example, the SMILES C(C) would represent a carbon connected to another carbon. So if the main chain is N-C(C)-..., then the carbon after N has a methyl group (from the C in parentheses). So that would make the structure N-CH(CH3)-... So the N is connected to a CH(CH3) group. But then the fragment we're looking for is N connected to a methyl group (CH3). In this case, the N is connected to a CH(CH3), which is not the same as a methyl. So the fragment would not match here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the N is part of a different group. Let's look for other parts of the molecule. The input molecule also has OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2. This part is a oxygen connected to a cyclohexane-like structure (C2CC...). The N here is part of a piperazine or similar ring? Maybe. But the fragment we're looking for is the methyl amide, which is -NC(=O)CH3. So the only place where there's an N connected to a carbonyl is in the beginning: CC(=O)N... So that's the acetyl group attached to N. But the question is whether the N has a methyl group attached. \n\nIn the input molecule's SMILES, after the acetyl (CC(=O)), there's N followed by C(C). So the N is connected to the carbonyl and to a C(C). If the C(C) is a methyl group, then the fragment would match. But if it's a different group, then it doesn't. \n\nWait, perhaps the C(C) is a methyl group. Let me think: in SMILES, if you have a carbon with branches, the branches are in parentheses. For example, a tert-butyl group would be C(C)(C)(C)C. But in this case, the SMILES is NC(C). So the N is connected to a C, which is connected to another C. So that's N-C-C. The second C could be a methyl if it's written as C(C), but that would imply a branch. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's take a simpler approach. The fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. We need to find how many times this exact group appears in the molecule. \n\nThe input molecule has CC(=O)NC(C)... The CC(=O) is the acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-). The N is attached to this acetyl. Now, the N is also attached to a C(C). So the N has two substituents: the acetyl group and the C(C). The fragment requires the N to be attached to the acetyl's carbonyl and a methyl group. But in the input, the N is attached to the acetyl's carbonyl and a C(C) group. So unless the C(C) is a methyl group, the fragment isn't present. \n\nBut C(C) would be a carbon attached to another carbon, which is a CH2 group if in a chain. For example, NC(C) would be N-CH2-CH3 (ethyl group) if it's a straight chain. But the SMILES here is CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc..., so after the N is C(C)c1... meaning the C after N is connected to another C (from C(C)) and the benzene ring (c1). So that C (after N) is bonded to three things: N, another C, and the benzene ring. Therefore, it's a tertiary carbon. The other C (from C(C)) is attached to this central C and possibly other groups. Wait, this is getting too tangled. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the C(C) is a methyl group attached to the N. But in SMILES, that would be written as N(C)C. For example, if the N is connected to two methyl groups, it would be N(C)(C). But in the input SMILES, it's NC(C), which is N connected to a C, which in turn is connected to another C. So the N is connected to a CH2 group (if it's a chain) or a branch. \n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 is present once in the molecule. Because the acetyl group (CC(=O)) is attached to an N, and if the N is also attached to a methyl group, then the fragment is present. But if the N is attached to something else (like a CH(CH3) group), then it's not. \n\nLooking again at the input SMILES: CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc... The N is connected to the acetyl and to a C(C). The C(C) here could be a methyl group if the SMILES is written as NC(C), which would imply N connected to a C which is connected to another C. But that's not a methyl. For example, NC(C) would be N-CH2-CH3 (ethyl group), not methyl. So the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 requires the N to have a methyl group attached. But in the input molecule, the N is attached to an ethyl group or a different substituent. \n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let's take a simple example. If the SMILES is CC(=O)NC, that would be N connected to the acetyl and a single C (methyl group). But that's not the case here. The SMILES here is CC(=O)NC(C). So after the N, there's a C connected to another C. Therefore, the N is connected to a CH2 group (since the C after N is connected to another C). So that's an ethyl group. Therefore, the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 (where N is connected to methyl) is not present. \n\nBut wait, maybe the C(C) is a branch. For example, if the N is connected to a carbon that has a methyl branch. Like N-C(-C)-... which would be N-CH(CH3)-... So in that case, the N is connected to a CH(CH3) group. But that's not a methyl group (CH3). So again, the fragment isn't present. \n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 is not present in the input molecule. But wait, the acetyl group is CH3-C(=O)-, and the N is attached to the carbonyl. The fragment is N-C(=O)-CH3, which would be the acetyl group attached to an N. So maybe the fragment is present once. Because the N is attached to the carbonyl (from acetyl) and another group. But the fragment specifies that the N is attached to the carbonyl and a methyl group. So unless the other substituent on the N is a methyl, it's not a match. \n\nIn the input molecule, the N is attached to the carbonyl (acetyl) and a C(C). If that C(C) is a methyl group, then yes. But from the SMILES, C(C) is a carbon attached to another carbon, which is not a methyl. A methyl group would just be C. So NC would be N connected to a methyl. But here it's NC(C), which is N connected to a C that's connected to another C. So that's not a methyl. Therefore, the fragment is not present. \n\nWait, but the fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. Let's parse that. The fragment is a nitrogen connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) which is connected to a methyl (CH3). So the structure is N-C(=O)-CH3. In the input molecule, the structure is CC(=O)NC(C)... So the N is connected to the C(=O) (from CC(=O)) and a C(C). So the N is attached to the carbonyl and a C(C), not a CH3. Therefore, the fragment is not present. \n\nBut wait, the acetyl group is CH3-C(=O)-, so the carbonyl is attached to a methyl. The N is attached to that carbonyl. So the fragment would require that the N is attached to the carbonyl and a methyl. But in the input molecule, the N is attached to the carbonyl and a C(C). So unless the C(C) is a methyl, which it's not, the count is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different part of the molecule where the fragment exists. Let me check the entire SMILES again. The input is CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2)cc1. Looking for other N-C(=O) groups. The only carbonyl I see is in the acetyl group at the beginning. The rest of the molecule has other groups like OC2CCN..., which might be ethers or amines, but not amides. The c3nc(...) part has an 'n' which is a nitrogen in a ring, but that's part of a nitrile or other functional group. The N4CCCC4C part is a cyclohexyl group attached to a nitrogen. But none of these are amides. \n\nTherefore, the only possible occurrence of the fragment is in the acetylated amine at the beginning. But as discussed, the N is attached to a C(C), not a methyl. Therefore, the count should be zero. \n\nWait, but wait. The fragment SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. The hyphen indicates that it's a substructure. So the N must be connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and a methyl (CH3). In the input molecule, the N is connected to the carbonyl (from the acetyl, which is CH3-C(=O)-) and a C(C). So the carbonyl here is part of the acetyl group. So the N is attached to the carbonyl (which is connected to a CH3) and another group. So does that count? Because the fragment is N-C(=O)-CH3. In the input molecule, the N is connected to a carbonyl that's connected to a CH3 (from the acetyl), but the N is also connected to another group (C(C)). So the fragment is N-C(=O)-CH3, but in the molecule, the N is connected to the C(=O) (which is connected to CH3) and another carbon. So the substructure would be present if the N has only those two substituents: the carbonyl and a methyl. But in the input molecule, the N has three substituents: the carbonyl, the C(C), and possibly a hydrogen. Wait, in amides, the nitrogen is usually bonded to two carbons and a hydrogen (secondary amide). So if the N in the input molecule is bonded to the carbonyl (C(=O)CH3), the C(C), and a hydrogen, then it's a secondary amide. The fragment is -NC(=O)CH3, which implies that the N is bonded only to the carbonyl and the methyl. But in reality, the N in the molecule has three bonds: to the carbonyl, C(C), and a hydrogen. So the actual structure is H-N(C(=O)CH3)-C(C)... So the fragment would require the N to have only two substituents: the carbonyl and methyl. Since the N has three substituents (carbonyl, C(C), and H), the fragment isn't present as a separate group. \n\nAlternatively, if the fragment is considered as a substructure regardless of other substituents, then the presence of N-C(=O)-CH3 as part of a larger structure would count. But the fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3, which is a nitrogen connected to a carbonyl and a methyl. So in the input molecule, the N is connected to the carbonyl (which is part of CH3-C(=O)-) and a C(C). Therefore, the N is connected to the carbonyl (from acetyl) and another group (C(C)), not a methyl. Hence, the fragment is not present. \n\nBut wait, the acetyl group is CH3-C(=O)-N... So the carbonyl is attached to a CH3 and the N. So the N is connected to the carbonyl (which is connected to CH3) and another group. So the fragment's requirement is that the N is connected to the carbonyl and a methyl. In the input molecule, the N is connected to the carbonyl (which is connected to a methyl) and another group (C(C)). So the fragment would require the N to have a direct methyl substituent, which it doesn't. Therefore, the count is zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the C(C) is a typo or misinterpretation. For example, if the SMILES was CC(=O)N(C)C..., then that would be N connected to two methyl groups. But in this case, it's CC(=O)NC(C)..., which is N connected to a C which is connected to another C. \n\nGiven all this, I think the correct count is zero. However, I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should double-check with another approach. Let's look for the substructure. The fragment is N-C(=O)-CH3. In the input molecule, the acetyl group is CH3-C(=O)-N... So the N is attached to the carbonyl. The N is also attached to a C(C). So the N has the structure N-C(=O)-CH3 (from the acetyl) and N-C(C). Therefore, the N is part of a larger group and does not have a methyl directly attached, but rather a C(C). Therefore, the fragment is not present. \n\nSo the final answer is zero.",

The input molecule is C=CCOCCn1c(SC)nc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c1-c1ccnc(NC(C)=O)c1, and the fragment we're looking for is -C(=O)H, which is a terminal aldehyde.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let me break down the SMILES. The molecule has a double bond (C=C) at the beginning, then an oxygen in an ether linkage (CCOCC). There's a ring with nitrogen (n1c...), some sulfur (SC), a fluorine-substituted benzene ring (-c2ccc(F)cc2), and another ring connected to a group that includes NC(C)=O.\n\nNow, the fragment is -C(=O)H. Terminal aldehyde means the aldehyde group (-CHO) is at the end of a chain, not part of a larger group like a ketone or amide. The SMILES for the fragment is -C(=O)H, so we're looking for a carbon attached to an oxygen double bond (carbonyl) and a hydrogen. But aldehydes are usually written as CH(O)=O or CHO, but in SMILES, it's typically O=CH- or -C(=O)H. However, in the molecule, the aldehyde would be a terminal group, so maybe the hydrogen is implied. But in the given fragment SMILES, it's explicitly written as -C(=O)H, so we need to look for that exact group.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES, I see NC(C)=O. That's an acetamide group: the N is connected to a carbonyl (C=O) via a C. The structure is NC(C)=O, which is H2N-C(O)-C=O? Wait, no, the SMILES is NC(C)=O. So the nitrogen is attached to a carbon, which is attached to another carbon (C) and a carbonyl group (=O). That would make it N-C(C)=O. So that's an acetamide group: the nitrogen is connected to a carbonyl, but the carbonyl is part of an amide, not an aldehyde. Because in an amide, the carbonyl is adjacent to the nitrogen. So NC(C)=O is like NH-C(O)-CH3? Wait, maybe the C is the central carbon. Let me parse it again: NC(C)=O. The nitrogen is bonded to a carbon, which has another single bond to another carbon (maybe a methyl group?), and a double bond to oxygen. So that would be N-C(C)(=O). So that's a structure where the nitrogen is attached to a carbonyl group and a methyl group. That's an amide, specifically acetamide (if the C is CH3). So that part is an amide, not an aldehyde.\n\nLooking through the rest of the molecule, other parts: the main chain starts with C=CCOCC, then there's the ring structures. I don't see any other carbonyl groups. The only other oxygen is in the ether (O in CCOCC) and the amide (=O). So the molecule has an amide group but no aldehyde. The fragment we're looking for is a terminal aldehyde (-C(=O)H), which would be -CHO. But in the molecule, the only carbonyl is part of an amide, not an aldehyde. Therefore, the count should be 0.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The fragment SMILES is -C(=O)H. In the input molecule, is there any occurrence where a carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and also has a hydrogen attached? The amide group has the carbonyl, but the adjacent carbon is connected to the nitrogen and a methyl group. So the carbonyl here is part of the amide, and the carbon in the carbonyl is bonded to another carbon (the one attached to the nitrogen). Therefore, that carbon in the carbonyl (C=O) is bonded to another carbon, not a hydrogen. So there's no -C(=O)H group here. The only possible place would be if there's a -CHO group somewhere else. But looking at the SMILES string, I don't see any other O attached to a carbon with a double bond except in the amide. So the count should be zero.",

The fragment we're looking for is the terminal aldehyde, which has the SMILES -C(=O)H.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a terminal aldehyde looks like. A terminal aldehyde is a carbonyl group (C=O) where the carbonyl carbon is at the end of the chain, meaning it's only bonded to one other carbon. The SMILES for the fragment is -C(=O)H, which implies that the aldehyde group is attached to the rest of the molecule via the carbon in the carbonyl group.\n\nNow, looking at the input molecule's SMILES. Let me parse it step by step. The main chain starts with CCC1OC(...), which is a cyclic structure (due to the numbers indicating ring closures). Inside the ring, there are various substituents. Let me check for the presence of -C(=O)H groups.\n\nLooking through the substituents: there's a part that says CC(C)=O. That's a ketone (C=O) attached to a carbon chain. But the fragment we're looking for is an aldehyde, which would be R-C(=O)H. The ketone here is R-C(=O)-R', which is not an aldehyde. So that's a ketone, not an aldehyde.\n\nWait, another part: there's OC(CC(C)=O)... Hmm, the CC(C)=O is again a ketone. So maybe the OC(CC(C)=O) is an oxygen connected to a carbon chain that has a ketone. Still not an aldehyde.\n\nIs there any part where the carbonyl group (C=O) is at the end of a chain, with only one carbon attached? Let me check again. The SMILES of the input molecule: CCC1OC(...)CC=C1C. Breaking down the substituents inside the ring:\n\n- C(C)=CC(C)C=CC2C(C)C2C=CC2OC(CC(C)=O)CC(O)C2O\n\nLooking for C(=O)H. The fragment is -C(=O)H. So in SMILES notation, an aldehyde would be written as CHO, but with the carbonyl connected to only one carbon. Let's look for any \"CHO\" groups.\n\nWait, the input molecule has CC(C)=O, which is a ketone. Then, there's OC(...) which includes CC(O)C2O. The O's here are hydroxyl groups. The part CC(C)=O is a ketone. No aldehyde groups here.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan the entire SMILES again. The input molecule:\n\nCCC1OC(C(C)=CC(C)C=CC2C(C)C2C=CC2OC(CC(C)=O)CC(O)C2O)CC=C1C\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main ring is 1 (the O is part of the ring? Wait, the structure starts with CCC1OC(...)CC=C1C. So the ring is formed by the atoms between 1 and the closing C1C. The ring is likely a five-membered or six-membered ring. But regardless, looking for the fragment.\n\nInside the substituents on the ring, there's a part: OC(CC(C)=O)CC(O)C2O. Here, CC(C)=O is a ketone (propan-2-one?), so that's a ketone, not an aldehyde. The other oxygen-containing groups are hydroxyls (O) and ethers (OC...).\n\nSo, does the molecule have any aldehyde groups? The fragment SMILES is -C(=O)H, which would correspond to an aldehyde group. In SMILES, an aldehyde is written as CHO, but in the context of being a substituent, it would be connected as CH(=O). Wait, the SMILES for the fragment is -C(=O)H. So that's a carbonyl group with a hydrogen attached. In the actual molecule, that would be a group like R-C(=O)H, where R is the rest of the molecule. But in the input SMILES, I don't see any such group. The only carbonyls are in the ketones (like CC(C)=O) and possibly other parts. \n\nWait, let me check again. The input SMILES: looking for a carbon connected to a carbonyl (C=O) and a hydrogen. So the structure would be C(=O)H. In the input, is there any occurrence where a carbon is double-bonded to O and has a hydrogen attached, and only one other carbon attached (since it's terminal)?\n\nLooking at the SMILES string again. The part CC(C)=O is a ketone (C(C)=O), which is a carbonyl connected to two carbons (the central carbon is connected to two CH3 groups and the carbonyl). That's a ketone, not an aldehyde.\n\nAnother part: OC(CC(C)=O)CC(O)C2O. The CC(C)=O here is the same ketone. The other parts have hydroxyl groups (O), but no aldehydes.\n\nSo, in the entire molecule, I don't see any aldehyde groups. All the carbonyl groups are ketones. Therefore, the count of terminal aldehyde fragments (-C(=O)H) should be zero.",

Breaking it down:\n\n- The molecule starts with CC(=O)N... So that's an acetyl group (C(=O)CH3) attached to a nitrogen. Then there's a C(C), which is a methyl group attached to another carbon. Then there's a benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1) with substituents. The substituent on the benzene is an O-linked group: OC2CCN(...)C2. The part after the oxygen is a cyclohexane-like ring (C2CCN...C2), but with some substitutions. The N in the middle is connected to a c3ccnc(...)n3 ring. That ring has a nitrogen connected to N4CCCC(F)(F)C4, which is a piperazine-like ring with two fluorines and a CF2 group maybe.\n\nBut the fragment we're looking for is -C(=O)CH3. The SMILES is -C(=O)CH3, which is an acetyl group. The hyphen at the beginning might indicate that it's a substituent attached via the carbonyl carbon. So we need to find all occurrences where the acetyl group (C(=O)CH3) is attached as a substituent in the molecule.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, the first part is CC(=O)N... So that's a methyl group (C) attached to a carbonyl (C=O), which is attached to a nitrogen. Wait, but the fragment is -C(=O)CH3. So the acetyl group here is O=C-CH3. In the input molecule, it's written as CC(=O)N..., which would be CH3-C(=O)-N... So that's exactly the acetyl group. So that's one occurrence.\n\nAre there any other acetyl groups in the molecule? Let's check the rest of the structure. The benzene ring has an O-linked substituent, which is an oxygen connected to a cyclohexane ring. The cyclohexane ring has a N connected to another aromatic ring. Then there's the part with N4CCCC(F)(F)C4, which is a fluorinated cyclohexane or something. I don't see any other carbonyl groups except the initial one. Let me check again.\n\nThe input molecule's SMILES: CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3ccnc(N4CCCC(F)(F)C4)n3)C2)cc1.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- CC(=O)N: Acetyl (C(=O)CH3) attached to N.\n- Then C(C): a CH(CH3) group? Because the next part is c1ccc... which is a benzene ring. So the structure is Acetyl-NH-CH(CH3)-benzene ring with substituents.\n\nThe substituent on the benzene is O-C2-C-C-N(...)-C2. The part inside the cyclohexane ring (C2CCN...) doesn't have any carbonyl groups. The other substituent is the c3ccnc(...)n3, which is a pyridine ring perhaps. The N connected to the N4 group: N4CCCC(F)(F)C4. That's a cyclohexyl group with two fluorines and a CF2 maybe.

The input molecule's SMILES is COC1CCCN(c2nccc(N3CCC(Oc4ccc(C(C)NC(C)=O)cc4)C3)n2)C1.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the input molecule's structure. The SMILES starts with COC, which is a methoxy group attached to a cyclohexane ring (since the '1' indicates a ring closure). The ring has a chain: CCCC connected to a nitrogen. Then there's a substituent on the nitrogen: c2nccc(...)n2. The ... part includes N3CCC(...)C3, which is a piperazine-like ring. The oxygen connected to the piperazine (Oc4ccc(...)cc4) leads to another benzene ring. Inside that benzene ring, there's a group: C(C)NC(C)=O.\n\nWait, let's break it down. The benzene ring (c4ccc(...)cc4) has a substituent C(C)NC(C)=O. The C(C) part is a methyl group attached to another carbon, which is connected to an amine (N), which is connected to a C(C)=O. The C(C)=O is a carbonyl group with a methyl substituent. So that part is -NC(C)=O. But the fragment we're looking for is -C(=O)CH3. Let me compare. The fragment is a carbonyl (C=O) connected to a methyl group (CH3). So in the molecule, the group is C(C)=O, which is a carbonyl (O=C-) attached to a CH(CH3)? Wait, no. Wait, C(C)=O would be O=C-C(CH3). Wait, no. Let me clarify. The SMILES notation is C(C)=O. That's a carbonyl group (C=O) where the carbon is attached to another carbon (the first C in C(C)=O). So the structure is CH2-C(=O). Wait, no. Wait, in SMILES, C(C)=O would be a carbon connected to another carbon and a double-bonded oxygen. So it's CH2-C(=O). But the fragment is -C(=O)CH3. So that's a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a methyl group (CH3). So the fragment is O=C-CH3. Let me see where that appears in the molecule.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, there's a part NC(C)=O. The amine (N) is connected to a carbon, which is connected to a C(C)=O. So the C(C)=O is a carbonyl group (C=O) with a methyl group (the C attached to it). Wait, C(C)=O would be a carbon connected to another carbon and a double-bond oxygen. So that's a ketone group: the central carbon is connected to a methyl group (C) and a carbonyl oxygen. So that's (CH3)C=O. Which is the same as the fragment -C(=O)CH3. Because the fragment is a carbonyl methyl group. So in the molecule, the group is C(C)=O, which is equivalent to -C(=O)CH3. So that's one occurrence.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The fragment is -C(=O)CH3. The SMILES for the fragment is -C(=O)CH3. The part in the molecule is C(C)=O. Let's parse that. The SMILES C(C)=O is a carbon atom (let's call it C1) connected to another carbon (C2) and double-bonded to an oxygen. So C1 is connected to C2 and O. So the structure is C2-C1(=O). So the group is CH2-C(=O), which is a ketone. But the fragment is a carbonyl (C=O) attached to a methyl group (CH3). Wait, the fragment is O=C-CH3. So in SMILES, that's CC(=O). But the molecule's part is C(C)=O, which is also CC(=O). So yes, that's exactly the same. So that's one occurrence.\n\nNow, are there any other parts of the molecule that have this fragment? Let's look again. The input molecule's SMILES is COC1CCCN(c2nccc(N3CCC(Oc4ccc(C(C)NC(C)=O)cc4)C3)n2)C1. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the beginning: COC1CCCN(...)C1. The cyclohexane ring (positions 1 and 6 are connected via the C1 closure). The ring has a methoxy group (COC), then three carbons (CCC), then a nitrogen connected to a substituent. The substituent is a pyrimidine ring (c2nccc(...)n2). The pyrimidine has a substituent N3CCC(...)C3, which is a piperazine ring. The piperazine has an oxygen (O) connected to a benzene ring (c4ccc(...)cc4). The benzene ring has a substituent C(C)NC(C)=O. \n\nSo the C(C)NC(C)=O group: breaking that down. The benzene is attached to a carbon (C), which is connected to another carbon (C), then a nitrogen (N), then another carbon (C) which is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O). So that's the part: the nitrogen is connected to a carbon that's part of a carbonyl group. Specifically, the C(C)=O part. So that's where the fragment is located. So that's one occurrence.\n\nIs there any other part of the molecule that has the -C(=O)CH3 group? Let me check the rest. The input molecule also starts with COC, which is a methoxy group (OCH3), but that's not the same as the carbonyl methyl. Then the cyclohexane ring and the other substituents. The piperazine ring (N3CCC(...)C3) doesn't have any carbonyl groups. The benzene ring attached via the oxygen (Oc4ccc(...)cc4) only has the C(C)NC(C)=O substituent. So the only occurrence of the fragment is in the C(C)=O part, which is once.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.",

Wait, CC(C)C is CH2CH(CH3)2, which is isobutyl. But the fragment we're looking for is t-butyl, which is C(C)(C)C. So that part is isobutyl, not t-butyl.\n\n4.

Let me break it down. Starting from the left: CC(...)c1ccccc1. The first part is a methyl group (CC) attached to some structure, then a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) at the end. The middle part is more complex. Let's look inside the parentheses: C(=O)Nc1ncc(SCc2ncc(C(C)(C)C)o2)s1. There's an amide group (C(=O)N), then a ring (c1ncc...s1). Inside that ring, there's a sulfur atom (S) connected to a CH2 group (Cc2...), which leads to another ring (c2ncc...o2). In that second ring, there's a C(C)(C)C group, which is a tert-butyl group.

The SMILES for the fragment is C(C)(C)C, but as a substituent, it would be attached via a single bond. In the input molecule, there's a C(C)(C)C group in the second ring (the c2ncc(C(C)(C)C)o2 part).

This second heterocycle has a nitrogen (n), carbons (cc), and an oxygen (o2).

The input molecule's SMILES is C#Cc1cc(Oc2cnc(NCC(C)O)nc2N)c(C(C)C)cc1OC. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. The SMILES starts with C#C, which is an acetylene group (a carbon-carbon triple bond). Then there's a benzene ring (c1cc...cc1). The substituents on the benzene ring include an O-linked group (Oc2...) and another methyl group (OC at the end). \n\nThe fragment given is -C#CH, which is a terminal acetylene group. So I need to look for any occurrences where a carbon with a triple bond is attached to another carbon and has a hydrogen. In SMILES notation, terminal acetylenes are represented as C#CH. However, in the input molecule, the SMILES starts with C#Cc1..., which means the acetylene is part of a larger structure. Specifically, the C#C is connected to the benzene ring.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES: the first part is C#Cc1... So the acetylene here is two carbons triple-bonded (C#C), but then connected to the benzene ring (c1...). The fragment we're looking for is -C#CH. In the input, the acetylene is C#C connected to the ring, so the right side is the ring, and the left side is just a single carbon. Wait, the SMILES starts with C#Cc1... So it's C triple bond C connected to a benzene ring (c1...). That means the structure is like HC#C- if it's terminal. But in this case, the acetylene is between two carbons: the first C is part of C#C, and the second C is attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be C#C- attached to the ring. But since there's no hydrogen on the triple bond carbons here, except maybe the first one. Wait, in SMILES, the order matters. The C#Cc1 means that the first carbon is triple bonded to the second, and the second is connected to the benzene ring. So the first carbon (left side of the triple bond) would have three bonds: the triple bond to the second carbon, and two other single bonds? Wait, no. Carbon can only have four bonds. So the first carbon (C) in C#C is triple bonded to the second C, which is then connected to the benzene ring. So the first C would have a triple bond (3 bonds) to the second C, and then one more bond, which would be to another atom. Wait, but in the SMILES string, the first part is C#Cc1... So the first C is triple bonded to the second C, which is connected to the benzene ring (c1). So the structure is: C#C-(benzene ring). But where's the hydrogen? For the fragment -C#CH, the terminal carbon should have a hydrogen. In the input molecule, the leftmost C in the triple bond (C#C) is only bonded to the other C and possibly another group. Wait, the SMILES starts with C#Cc1... So the first C is triple bonded to the second C, which is connected to the benzene ring. So the first C (leftmost) has only two bonds: triple bond to the second C and one single bond? Wait, that can't be right. Each carbon must have four bonds. So the leftmost C in C#C has a triple bond (3 bonds) to the second C, and then one more bond. But in the SMILES string, the first C is written as C#C... So maybe the first C is connected to another atom. Wait, let me parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nThe SMILES is C#Cc1cc(Oc2cnc(NCC(C)O)nc2N)c(C(C)C)cc1OC.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is C#Cc1... So the first carbon (C) is triple bonded to the next carbon (C), which is connected to a benzene ring (c1...). The first carbon (C) in the triple bond must have another bond. Since SMILES notation builds from left to right, the first C is the starting point. So C#Cc1... means that the first C is triple bonded to the next C, which is then connected to the benzene ring (c1). But each carbon in the triple bond must have two other bonds. So the first C (leftmost in the triple bond) has the triple bond to the second C and another single bond. But in the SMILES string, after the triple bond, the next character is 'c1', which is a benzene ring. So the second C in the triple bond is connected to the benzene ring. Then the first C (leftmost) in the triple bond must have another bond. Since there's no other atom specified after the first C, it's possible that the first C has a hydrogen attached. Wait, in SMILES, hydrogen atoms are often implicit. So if a carbon has fewer than four bonds, the remaining are assumed to be hydrogens. So the first C in C#C would have one single bond (to the second C) and triple bond (three bonds), which can't be. Wait, no: a triple bond is three bonds, but each carbon in the triple bond uses three of their four valence bonds. So each carbon in the triple bond has one remaining bond. So the first C (leftmost) in C#C would have a triple bond (three bonds) to the second C, and one additional bond. If there's no other atom specified, that bond is to a hydrogen. So the leftmost C would be CH (with one hydrogen), and the second C is connected to the benzene ring. So the structure would be HC#C-(benzene ring). Therefore, the fragment -C#CH would be present once here because the leftmost C in the triple bond has a hydrogen. \n\nBut wait, the fragment is given as -C#CH. The SMILES for the fragment is -C#CH, which implies that the acetylene is a substituent, with the triple bond between two carbons, and the terminal end (the one with the hydrogen) is attached to the rest of the molecule. Wait, no: the fragment is -C#CH, so the attachment point is on the carbon that's part of the triple bond and has the hydrogen. Wait, maybe the fragment is a terminal acetylene group, where the triple bond is between two carbons, one of which has a hydrogen and is attached to the main molecule. So in the input molecule, the acetylene group is HC#C- attached to the benzene ring. So that would match the fragment -C#CH, because the fragment is connected via the carbon with the hydrogen. Wait, the fragment's SMILES is -C#CH. The hyphen indicates the point of attachment. So the fragment is a carbon triple bonded to another carbon, which has a hydrogen. The hyphen is on the first carbon (the one not attached to hydrogen). So the fragment is like R-C#CH, where R is the rest of the molecule. So in the input molecule, the structure is R-C#C-H, which matches the fragment. Therefore, the input molecule has one occurrence of this fragment. \n\nAre there any other possible occurrences? Let's check the rest of the molecule. The benzene ring has substituents: O-linked to another ring (Oc2...), a methyl group (OC at the end), and a C(C(C)C) group. The part after the O in O-linked is c2cnc(NCC(C)O)nc2N. That seems to be a pyridine ring or similar. The NCC(C)O part is a diethylamine oxide or something. But in any case, looking for other triple bonds. The input SMILES only has one triple bond, which is the initial C#C. So there's only one occurrence of the fragment -C#CH. Therefore, the count should be 1.",

Then there's a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1). \n\nLooking at the substituents on the benzene ring: the first part is the sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)). Then, the benzene ring has another substituent: NC(=S)NC(=O)c2cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c2. Let's parse this. \n\nThe NC(=S) part has a nitrogen connected to a carbon which is double-bonded to sulfur (C=S).

Then there's a chain with a benzene ring. Let me parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nBreaking down the SMILES:\n\n- The main chain starts with CC, so two carbons. The second carbon has branches:\n  - C(=O)NCc...: The carbonyl is connected to an NH (amide), then a CH2 (from Cc), leading to a benzene ring (c1ccc...).\n  \nLooking further into the branches, there's another part: NS(C)(=O)=O. Wait, that's a sulfonamide group. Let's see: NS(C)(=O)=O. The nitrogen is connected to S, which has two double bonds to oxygen and a methyl group (C). So that's -N-SO2-CH3, which matches the fragment SMILES -NHSO2CH3. But wait, the fragment is -NHSO2CH3, which would be NHS(O)(=O)C. In the input molecule, the group is NS(C)(=O)=O. Let me check if that's the same.\n\nThe fragment is -NHSO2CH3. The sulfonamide group is typically where a nitrogen is attached to a sulfur atom which is double-bonded to two oxygens and a methyl group. In the input molecule's part: NS(C)(=O)=O. The N is connected directly to S. The S has two double bonds to O (=O)=O, which is equivalent to SO2, and a C (methyl group). So the group here is N-SO2-CH3. But the fragment is -NHSO2CH3. Wait, the difference is that the fragment has a NH (amine) connected to the SO2CH3. But in the input molecule's group, it's N attached directly to S. That would be a sulfonamide where the nitrogen is part of the sulfonamide group (like R-N-SO2-CH3), which is exactly the sulfonamide group. So in this case, the group is NS(C)(=O)=O, which is N connected to S, which is connected to a methyl (C) and two oxygens. So that's the sulfonamide group. Therefore, in the input molecule, how many times does this group appear?\n\nLooking at the SMILES string, the part \"NS(C)(=O)=O\" occurs once. Let me check the entire structure.

Specifically, the part \"c1ccc(NS(C)(=O)=O)c(F)c1\" indicates that on the benzene ring (c1ccc...), there's a substituent at position whatever which is NS(C)(=O)=O. That's the sulfonamide group. So that's one occurrence. Are there any other parts of the molecule that have this group? Let me check the rest of the SMILES.\n\nThe SMILES is: CC(C(=O)NCc1ccc(C(F)(F)F)nc1OCc1ccc(F)cc1)c1ccc(NS(C)(=O)=O)c(F)c1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part: CC( ... ) where the central C is connected to another C (the first CC).

Starting with C=CC, which is a propene group. Then there's a ring structure with n1c(...)nnc1. Inside that, there's an SCc group attached. The SCc part would be a sulfur (S) connected to a carbon chain (Cc...). \n\nLooking further into the SCc part: the c is part of another ring, c2nnc([S-])n2-c2ccccc2.

The input molecule's SMILES is C[C@@H]1CCC/C(=N/[NH+]=C(/[S-])NCc2ccccc2, and the fragment SMILES is -S. Wait, but thiols are typically -SH groups. The fragment SMILES given here is -S, but that could be a sulfur atom attached to something. Let me check the structure carefully.\n\nLooking at the molecule: Starting with C[C@@H]1CCC..., there's a cyclohexane ring perhaps? Then there's /C(=N/[NH+]=C(/[S-])NCc2ccccc2. Let's break that down. The part /C(=N/...) suggests a double bond with a nitrogen. The [NH+] indicates a protonated amine. Then there's =C(/[S-])... so the carbon here is connected to a sulfur with a negative charge, [S-]. So that sulfur is part of a thiolate group, right? Because thiols are -SH, but here it's deprotonated as S-.\n\nSo the fragment they're looking for is thiols, which would be -SH. But in the molecule, the sulfur is present as -S- (with a negative charge), which is the conjugate base of a thiol. Since the fragment SMILES is given as -S, maybe they're considering any sulfur in that context. Wait, but SMILES notation: if the fragment is -S, that would match a sulfur atom attached to another atom. In the molecule, there's a [S-] connected to a carbon. So the structure here is C-S^-.\n\nBut thiols are R-SH. If the sulfur is deprotonated (as in the molecule here), it's not a thiol anymore but a thiolate. So the count of thiol groups (SH) would be zero because the sulfur is in the deprotonated form. However, maybe the question is considering any sulfur that could be part of a thiol group, but according to the given SMILES, the fragment is -S, not -SH. Wait, the fragment name is thiols, which suggests SH groups. There's a discrepancy here. The fragment SMILES is -S, but the name is thiols. That might be a mistake. Because thiols should have -SH, which would be -S- with a hydrogen. But in the given SMILES, the sulfur is [S-], so maybe the user is asking for the number of sulfur atoms in a thiolate group? Or perhaps they made a typo in the fragment SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is intended to be any sulfur in a thiol or thiolate group. But according to the problem statement, the fragment name is thiols, which are -SH. So if the molecule has a deprotonated thiol (S-), then the count should be zero. But the fragment SMILES given is -S, which would match the S in the molecule. However, the name is thiols, which implies -SH. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nLet me look at the molecule again. The SMILES is C[C@@H]1CCC/C(=N/[NH+]=C(/[S-])NCc2ccccc2)C1. The sulfur is part of =C(/[S-])... So the structure around sulfur is a carbon double-bonded to another group, and single-bonded to S-. So the sulfur here is in a thiolate form, not a thiol. Therefore, if the fragment is thiols (-SH), the count is zero. But if the fragment is -S (as in the SMILES given), then there's one occurrence. But since the fragment name is thiols, maybe the intended answer is zero. However, the user might have made a mistake in the fragment SMILES. Let's check: maybe the correct fragment SMILES for thiols is -SH. In that case, the molecule has no -SH groups. But the given fragment SMILES is -S, which would match the S- here? Or perhaps the user considers the S- as part of the thiol group. But in chemistry, thiols are protonated, and thiolates are deprotonated. So unless the solution is considering the presence of S- as part of a thiol group (which it's not), the count would be zero. However, the fragment SMILES is given as -S, which is just a sulfur atom connected to something. In the molecule, there is a single S- attached to a carbon. So the SMILES fragment -S would match once. But the name is thiols, which is conflicting. So there's ambiguity here. But according to the problem statement, the fragment SMILES is -S and the name is thiols. The user might have intended the count of sulfur atoms in thiol groups, but if the sulfur is deprotonated, then it's not a thiol. Therefore, the correct count is zero. Alternatively, if the fragment is simply the presence of S in any form, then one. But given the name thiols, the count should be zero. However, the user might have a mistake in their fragment SMILES. Since the problem states to use the given fragment SMILES and name, perhaps the answer is zero, but I need to check the structure again. Let me parse the SMILES again. The part is /C(=N/[NH+]=C(/[S-])NCc2ccccc2). The sulfur is [S-], so it's a negatively charged sulfur attached to a carbon. So in the molecule, there's a C-S^- group. That's a thiolate, not a thiol. Therefore, the count of thiols (-SH) is zero. But the fragment SMILES is -S, which would be a sulfur atom with one bond. The SMILES for the fragment is \"-S\", which would match a sulfur atom connected to the rest of the molecule via a single bond. In the input molecule, the sulfur is connected to a carbon via a single bond (as part of the =C(/[S-])...), so the SMILES pattern -S would match that. However, the charge is different. The fragment SMILES doesn't specify charge, so does that matter? In SMILES notation, the charges are part of the atom's definition. So if the fragment is -S, it would match a sulfur atom without charge. But in the molecule, the sulfur has a negative charge. Therefore, the SMILES pattern -S would not match [S-]. So in that case, the count would be zero. Wait, but the fragment is given as -S, which in SMILES is just S. If the actual fragment in the molecule is [S-], then the SMILES pattern wouldn't match because of the charge. So the count should be zero. Therefore, even though there's a sulfur atom in the molecule, because it's charged, it doesn't match the fragment SMILES. Hence, the count is zero. But this depends on whether the fragment SMILES is intended to match the charged form. Since the user provided the fragment SMILES as -S, not considering charge, maybe they want to count any sulfur, regardless of charge. But in SMILES syntax, unless specified, atoms are considered in their neutral state. Therefore, [S-] is a different atom than S. So the answer should be zero. But maybe the user intended to have the fragment as [S-], but made a typo. However, according to the given information, the correct approach is to match the SMILES exactly. So in the molecule, there is one [S-], which does not match -S (which is S without charge), so the count is zero. Therefore, the final answer is zero.",

I need to count how many times this fragment appears in the molecule.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the SMILES of the input molecule. Let's break it down. The main chain seems to be a central carbon attached to a methyl group (C), an amino group (NH), which is connected to a carbonyl (C=O) and then a chain of NCCC. Wait, the SMILES is C[C@H](NC(=O)NCCC[S@](C)=O)c1ccc(Cl)s1. So, the central carbon is chiral (indicated by @H). The substituents on that carbon are: a methyl (C), an NC(=O)NCCC[S@](C)=O group, and a thiophene ring (c1ccc(Cl)s1) substituted with chlorine.\n\nLooking at the NC(=O)NCCC[S@](C)=O part. Let's see: the amino group (N) is connected to a carbonyl (C=O), then another N, then CCC, then a sulfur atom. The sulfur has a chiral center (@) and is connected to a methyl group (C) and an oxygen (=O).

Since the sulfur is part of this group and there's only one such S in the molecule, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The molecule has [S@](C)=O. So the sulfur is connected to a methyl (C), an oxygen (as =O), and the rest of the chain. The sulfinyl group is -S(=O)-, and when attached to a methyl, that's exactly the fragment. So in the molecule, there's one occurrence of this fragment. Therefore, the count is 1.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to count how many times the isocyanate fragment (-N=C=O) appears in the input molecule O=C=NC(c1ccccc1)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize both the input molecule and the fragment. The fragment isocyanate is a group where a nitrogen is double-bonded to a carbon, which is then double-bonded to an oxygen. The SMILES for the fragment is -N=C=O, which means it's connected to the rest of the molecule through the nitrogen.\n\nNow, looking at the input molecule's SMILES: O=C=NC(c1ccccc1)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1. Let's parse this. Starting from the left, we have O=C=N. The O is double-bonded to C, which is double-bonded to N. Then the N is connected to a central carbon atom (C), which has three benzene rings attached (each c1ccccc1 represents a benzene ring). So the structure is O=C=N-C(Ph)(Ph)Ph, where Ph stands for phenyl groups.\n\nThe key part here is the O=C=N- group attached to the central carbon. The fragment we're looking for is -N=C=O. Wait, the fragment's SMILES is written as -N=C=O, which implies that the nitrogen is connected to the rest of the molecule. But in the input molecule, the sequence is O=C=N-C. So the order here is O=C=N-... So the N is connected to the central carbon. But the fragment is -N=C=O, which would be N connected to the rest of the molecule (R-N=C=O). But in the input molecule, the order is O=C=N-R. So that's O double-bonded to C, which is double-bonded to N, which is connected to R. So the actual group here is O=C=N-R, which is an isocyanate group (the correct structure for isocyanate is R-N=C=O). Wait a second, that seems reversed. Isocyanate is usually R-N=C=O, where the nitrogen is attached to the R group, followed by C=O. But in the input molecule, the arrangement is O=C=N-R. That would be a different group, perhaps an isocyanate isomer? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the structure here. Let me check.\n\nIsocyanate has the structure R\u2013N=C=O. So the nitrogen is connected to the R group, then a carbon double-bonded to both the nitrogen and an oxygen. In the input molecule's SMILES, the sequence is O=C=N-C. So oxygen is double-bonded to carbon, which is double-bonded to nitrogen, which is connected to the central carbon. That would be O=C=N\u2013C. But that's not the same as the isocyanate fragment. Because in the input molecule, the order is O=C=N\u2013R, whereas the isocyanate fragment is R\u2013N=C=O. The order of atoms in the SMILES matters here. SMILES is directional, so the way the atoms are connected affects the actual structure. So in the input molecule, the group is O=C=N-R, which is not the same as R-N=C=O. Therefore, the isocyanate fragment (-N=C=O) is not present in the input molecule. Instead, the molecule has a cyanate group (O=C=N-R) or maybe an iso-cyanate but with the wrong connectivity. Wait, cyanate is OCN-, isocyanate is NCO-. So the correct SMILES for isocyanate would be N=C=O attached to R via the nitrogen. But in the input molecule, the SMILES is O=C=NC(...), which would be O=C=N-C. So that's O=C=N connected to the central carbon. Therefore, the nitrogen is between the two carbons: O=C=N-C. But the fragment is -N=C=O. So if we look at the input molecule, the group is O=C=N-C. That's a different connectivity. The fragment would require the nitrogen to be connected to another part of the molecule (R-N=C=O), but here the nitrogen is connected to the central carbon. So the sequence in the input is O=C=N-C, which is not the same as the fragment -N=C=O. Therefore, the count should be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding. Let's draw the structures. The input molecule's relevant part is O=C=N-C. The fragment is -N=C=O. If the fragment is written as -N=C=O, then the nitrogen is attached to the rest of the molecule. So in the input, the nitrogen is attached to the central carbon. So in that case, the group would be C-N=C=O. Wait, but the input's SMILES is O=C=NC(...). So the sequence is O=C=N-C. That would be O=C=N-C, meaning the central carbon is attached to the N, which is double-bonded to C, which is double-bonded to O. So the group is O=C=N-C. That would be an isocyanate group if the connectivity were N=C=O-R, but here it's O=C=N-R. That's a different arrangement, which is actually a cyanate group. Wait, maybe I got the direction wrong. Let me clarify. The isocyanate group is R-N=C=O. The cyanate group is R-O-C\u2261N. But here, the structure is O=C=N-R. That would be a different functional group. Wait, perhaps it's an iso-cyanate? No, because the iso-cyanate is N=C=O-R. Wait, maybe the SMILES notation allows for different directions. In SMILES, the order of atoms matters. So if the SMILES is O=C=N-C, that's O connected to C via double bond, C connected to N via double bond, N connected to C via single bond. So the structure is O=C=N-C. The fragment we're looking for is -N=C=O. So if the fragment is -N=C=O, then in the input molecule, is there a nitrogen connected via a double bond to a carbon, which is double-bonded to an oxygen, and that nitrogen is connected to another part of the molecule? In the input molecule, the nitrogen is connected to the central carbon and to the C=O. Wait, O=C=N-C. So the nitrogen is between the C=O and the central carbon. So that's O=C=N-C. That's a nitrile oxide group, perhaps? Not the same as isocyanate. Therefore, the fragment -N=C=O is not present in the input molecule. Hence, the count is zero.",

The user wants to know how many times the fragment \"-SO3CH3\" (methyl ester sulfonyl) appears in the input molecule \"COS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c2ccccc12\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of both the input molecule and the fragment. The input molecule's SMILES is COS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c2ccccc12. Let me break that down. The \"CO\" part is a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Then there's S(=O)(=O), which is a sulfonyl group (SO2). So the beginning part is COS(=O)(=O), which is a methyl sulfonate group. The rest of the molecule is a bicyclic aromatic system with a chlorine substituent.\n\nNow, the fragment we're looking for is -SO3CH3, which is the methyl ester of sulfonic acid. The SMILES for that would be CS(=O)(=O)O-. Wait, no. Let me think. The sulfonic acid is SO3H, so the methyl ester would replace the H with a methyl group. So the correct SMILES should be COS(=O)(=O)-. Wait, the fragment SMILES given is \"-SO3CH3\", which might be written as CS(=O)(=O)O-. But SMILES notation usually starts from the central atom. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is O=S(=O)(OCH3). Let me confirm. The methyl ester sulfonyl group would have the structure where the sulfonyl (SO2) is connected to an oxygen that's attached to a methyl group. So the sulfonic acid is SO3H, and the ester would be SO3CH3. So the SMILES for the fragment would be O=S(=O)(OC) . But the given fragment SMILES is \"-SO3CH3\", which can be interpreted as the sulfonate group (S(=O)(=O)-O-CH3). So the SMILES would be COS(=O)(=O)-. Wait, the fragment is -SO3CH3, so the sulfur is connected to three oxygens (two double bonds, one single bond) and a methyl group. So the structure is S(=O)(=O)-O-CH3. Wait, no, the ester would be O-SO2-OCH3? Or is the methyl directly attached to the sulfur? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify: Sulfonic acid is R-SO3H. The ester would replace the -OH with -OCH3, so R-SO3-OCH3. But in SMILES notation, that would be written as R-S(=O)(=O)OCH3. So the fragment here is the -SO3CH3 group, which is S(=O)(=O)(OCH3). Therefore, the SMILES would be O=S(=O)(OC) . But the given fragment SMILES is \"-SO3CH3\", which could be written as [O-]S(=O)(=O)C. Wait, no. Let me parse \"-SO3CH3\". The SMILES for the fragment is written as -SO3CH3. The hyphen indicates the point of attachment. So the fragment is a sulfonate group where the sulfur is connected to three oxygens and a methyl group. But sulfur can have up to six bonds. Wait, sulfonate is typically SO3^-, but in the ester, it's SO3-O-CH3. Wait, maybe the correct structure is S(=O)(=O)(OCH3). So the SMILES would be O=S(=O)(OCH3). But the fragment SMILES given is \"-SO3CH3\", which would be written as S(=O)(=O)(OCH3)-, with the hyphen indicating the attachment point. So the actual group is S(=O)(=O)(OCH3), connected to the rest of the molecule via the sulfur? Wait, no. In sulfonate esters, the sulfur is connected to two oxygen atoms via double bonds, one oxygen connected to the methyl group, and the fourth bond is to the rest of the molecule. So the structure is R-O-SO2-OCH3? No, wait. Sulfonate ester is R-SO2-O-R'. So the sulfonyl group (SO2) is connected to an oxygen, which is then connected to the methyl group. So the correct structure would be R-S(=O)(=O)-O-CH3. Therefore, the SMILES for the fragment would be O=S(=O)(OCH3). But the fragment SMILES provided is \"-SO3CH3\", which may be written as S(=O)(=O)(OCH3)-, with the attachment point on the sulfur. Wait, but in the input molecule, the structure is COS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c2ccccc12. Let's parse that: CO-S(=O)(=O)-c1ccc(Cl)c2ccccc12. So the oxygen from the CO is connected to the sulfur, which has two double bonds to oxygen atoms (S(=O)(=O)), and then connected to the aromatic ring. So the structure is methyl (CH3-O-) attached to sulfur, which is sulfonyl (S(=O)(=O)), then connected to the aromatic ring. So the group here is CH3-O-SO2-aryl. Which is a methyl sulfonate ester. So the fragment in the input molecule is exactly the methyl ester sulfonyl group (SO3CH3). \n\nTherefore, the fragment we're looking for is present once in the input molecule. The entire molecule has that group attached once. There's only one occurrence of the methyl sulfonate group (COS(=O)(=O)-). So the count should be 1.",

The input molecule's SMILES is CCOc1cc(NC(=O)c2ccccc2)c(OCC)cc1[N+]#N.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let's break down the SMILES. The main part seems to be a benzene ring (the part starting with c1cc...cc1). The substituents on the ring are OCC (ethoxy group), NC(=O)c2ccccc2 (which is an amide group attached to another benzene ring), OCC (another ethoxy), and [N+]#N. Wait, the [N+]#N part is interesting. The diazo fragment is -N#N, but here it's written as [N+]#N. Does the charge affect whether this counts as the fragment?\n\nThe fragment SMILES given is -N#N, which is a neutral diazo group. But in the input molecule, the diazo is written with a positive charge on the first nitrogen: [N+]#N. So the actual group here is a diazonium ion, which is different from the neutral diazo. Since the fragment specified is -N#N (without the charge), the presence of a charge might mean it's not a match. However, sometimes in SMILES notation, charges can be part of the structure. Let me check if the charge is part of the actual group or just a notation artifact.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES: ...cc1[N+]#N. The [N+] indicates a positively charged nitrogen atom connected via a triple bond to another nitrogen. The diazo fragment as specified is the neutral -N#N. The charge here would mean that the group in the molecule is a diazonium ion, which is a different chemical entity. Therefore, this would not match the fragment specified. But wait, maybe the charge was a typo, or perhaps the user intended to have the diazo group regardless of charge. However, the fragment SMILES is explicitly -N#N, so the charge would make it different. So in this case, the input molecule has [N+]#N, which is a diazonium group, not the neutral diazo. Therefore, the count should be zero.\n\nWait, but maybe the user is considering the diazo group even if it's charged. Let me think again. The fragment is defined as -N#N. The SMILES for the fragment doesn't include a charge. The molecule has [N+]#N. Since the SMILES matching is exact, unless the charge is ignored. But in SMILES notation, charges are part of the atom's definition. So the [N+] would not match an N without the charge. Therefore, the count is zero.

The input molecule is O=S(=O)([O-])c1ccc(Cl)c2cccnc12, and the fragment we're looking for is -SO3H with the name sulfonic acid.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. The SMILES notation given is O=S(=O)([O-])c1ccc(Cl)c2cccnc12. Let me break that down. The core seems to be a sulfur atom connected to two oxygen atoms via double bonds (S(=O)(=O)), but then there's an [O-] attached as well. Wait, the sulfonic acid group is typically -SO3H. In the molecule, the sulfur is bonded to three oxygens, but here one of them is a negatively charged oxygen ([O-]). That suggests that the sulfonic acid might be deprotonated, forming a sulfonate group (-SO3^-).\n\nThe fragment we're looking for is -SO3H, which is the protonated form. However, in the input molecule, the sulfur is connected to an oxygen with a negative charge. That means the sulfonic acid has lost a proton, so it's a sulfonate ion.

If the molecule is in a solution where the proton is lost (like a salt), then the count would be zero. \n\nLooking at the SMILES again: O=S(=O)([O-])... The sulfur has two double-bonded oxygens and one singly bonded oxygen with a negative charge. So that's three oxygen atoms attached to sulfur, but one is negatively charged. In sulfonic acid, all three oxygens are either double-bonded or have an -OH group. Here, instead of an -OH, there's an -O^- which implies deprotonation.

The input molecule's SMILES is O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2)[C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the SMILES of the input molecule. Breaking it down: There's a sulfur atom (S) connected to an oxygen (=O) in a ring structure (indicated by the 1). Then there's a carbon chain with some substituents. The part that catches my eye is the S(=O)(=O)[O-] group. Wait, the fragment is -SO3H, which is sulfonic acid. But in the molecule, the group is S(=O)(=O)O- (sulfonate), which is the deprotonated form, so maybe that's considered as the sulfonic acid group in its conjugate base form?\n\nThe user specified the fragment as -SO3H. The SMILES for sulfonic acid would typically be -S(=O)(=O)OH, but sometimes written as -SO3H. In the input molecule, the group is S(=O)(=O)[O-], which is the sulfonate ion, not the protonated sulfonic acid. But maybe in this context, they're considering the sulfonate as part of the count? Or perhaps the user made a typo and the fragment should be -SO3- ?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has two sulfonic acid groups that are deprotonated. Let me look again. The input molecule has two sulfur atoms: the first one is part of O=S1(=O)... and the second one is S(=O)(=O)[O-]. Wait, the first S is in a ring. Let me count the substituents. The first S is double-bonded to O, and another O is attached (as part of the ring). Then, the second S is connected to two =O groups and an O- (as well as another oxygen from the ring maybe?). Hmm, maybe I need to draw this structure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the SMILES: O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2)[C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1. The first S is part of a ring: S1. The ring is 6-membered? Let's break it down:\n\n- The S1 is connected to O (double bond), then another O (from =O), then a CC group. The next part is [C@@H](Nc2ccccc2), which is a chiral carbon connected to an NH group attached to a benzene ring. Then another [C@@H] which is connected to S(=O)(=O)[O-], and then back to C1 to close the ring.\n\nSo the two sulfur atoms are in the ring: the first S is at position 1, and then there's another S in the side chain? Wait, no. Wait, the SMILES is O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](...) [C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1. So the ring is S1-C-C-...-C1. The first S is part of the ring. Then, in the side chain, there's another S in the S(=O)(=O)[O-] group. So that's two sulfur atoms. The first one is part of a sulfoxide (O=S1(=O)) but that might be a sulfone? Wait, O=S1(=O) would be a sulfone group if there are two double-bonded oxygens. Wait, the notation here might be O=S(=O)(...), which would make it a sulfonic acid group. Wait, no. Let me parse the SMILES correctly.\n\nThe SMILES starts with O=S1(=O). That's a sulfur atom with two double bonds to oxygen (O=S(=O)) and then part of a ring (the 1). Then the ring continues: C, then [C@@H](N...), then [C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-]), and back to C1. So the ring is S1-C-C-C-C1? Wait, let's count the atoms in the ring. The first part is O=S1(=O)C... which suggests that the S is connected to a C, then another C, then a chiral C, then another chiral C, then back to C1. So the ring has four atoms? S1, C, C, C, and back to S1? Wait, that would be a 4-membered ring? That seems unlikely. Maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is S1-C-C-C-C1, making a five-membered ring? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES is written as O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2)[C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1. So the ring is S1 connected to C, then C (from the first C), then the two chiral carbons, then the last C1. So S1-C-C-C-C-C1? That would make a six-membered ring. Wait, let's see:\n\nS1 is connected to O (double bond), then another O (from the =O), then the next atom is C (from C[C@@H...). Then that C is connected to another C (the first C in the chain), then the chiral center, then another chiral center, then the next C (from the second [C@@H]), then the C1 at the end. So the ring is S1-C-C-C-C-C1? That's six atoms in the ring: S, C, C, C, C, C? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to parse step by step:\n\nThe SMILES is O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2)[C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first atom is O, connected to S1 with a double bond (O=S1).\n- S1 has another double bond to O (=O), so S1 is double-bonded to two O's? Wait, no. The notation O=S1(=O) means that the S1 has an O double-bonded (the O= part) and another =O group. So S1 has two double bonds to O atoms. That would be a sulfone group (SO2), but here it's part of a ring.\n\nThen S1 is connected to C (from the C that follows), which is part of a chain: C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2). The C is connected to another C (the first C in the chain), which is connected to a chiral center [C@@H] with substituents N (attached to a benzene ring via c2ccccc2).\n\nThen there's another chiral center [C@@H] connected to S(=O)(=O)[O-], and finally the C1 closes the ring. So the ring is S1 connected to C, then to the two chiral carbons, then to another C (from C1), making a five-membered ring? Or perhaps S1 is connected to the first C, then the next C, then two chiral Cs, then back to S1? That would be a five-membered ring: S1-C-C-C-C-S1? No, that's five atoms. Wait, but the last part is C1, which refers back to S1. So the ring is S1-C-C-C-C1? That would make a five-membered ring: S1, C, C, C, C1 (which is another C?), but I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to focus on the sulfur atoms.\n\nThe molecule has two sulfur atoms: S1 and the S in the S(=O)(=O)[O-] group. The first S (S1) is part of a sulfone group (O=S(=O)) in a ring. The second S is in a sulfonate group (S(=O)(=O)[O-]). The fragment we're looking for is -SO3H. The sulfonate group is the deprotonated form (SO3-), so if the fragment is the protonated form (SO3H), does that count? Or does the fragment include the deprotonated version?\n\nThe user specified the fragment as -SO3H with SMILES. The SMILES for -SO3H is -S(=O)(=O)OH. The SMILES in the molecule is S(=O)(=O)[O-], which is the conjugate base. If the user is looking for the sulfonic acid group, which is -SO3H, then the deprotonated form (sulfonate) wouldn't count. But sometimes, in practice, people might refer to the sulfonate as part of the sulfonic acid group in a different form. However, strictly speaking, -SO3H is the protonated form. Therefore, the sulfonate group (O-) would not be considered as -SO3H.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, the second S is part of S(=O)(=O)[O-], which is a sulfonate group. So that's one occurrence if we count the deprotonated form as part of the fragment. But according to the fragment definition, it's -SO3H. Therefore, that group is not present as such. However, maybe the first S in the ring is part of a sulfonic acid group?\n\nThe first S is in O=S1(=O)... So S1 has two double bonds to O atoms and is connected to a carbon. Wait, sulfonic acid groups are typically -SO3H, where the sulfur is connected to three oxygen atoms (two double bonds and one -OH group). In this case, the first S has two double bonds to O and is connected to a carbon and another O (from the ring?), but I'm not sure. Let me re-examine the SMILES.\n\nThe SMILES starts with O=S1(=O)C... So S1 is connected via double bonds to two O atoms (O=S1(=O)). Then it's connected to a carbon (C). So the sulfur here has two double-bonded oxygens and a single bond to carbon. That would make it a sulfone group (R-SO2-R'), but in this case, since it's part of a ring, maybe it's a cyclic sulfone. However, a sulfonic acid group requires three oxygen atoms attached to sulfur: two double bonds and one -OH. Here, the first S has two double bonds and two single bonds (to C and another O?), perhaps? Wait, the SMILES is O=S1(=O)C... So S1 has two double bonds (O= and =O) and a single bond to C. That's three substituents. Sulfur can have expanded valence, so maybe it's possible. But in this case, that would be a sulfone (SO2) group with an additional oxygen? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the SMILES notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first S is part of a sulfonic acid group. If S has three oxygen atoms: two double bonds and one -O- (as part of the ring), then that would be a sulfonate ester or similar. But the fragment is sulfonic acid (-SO3H), which has a hydroxyl group. In this molecule, the first S has two O double bonds and is connected to a C and another O (from the ring?), but I don't see a hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to it. The second S has two double bonds to O, one O- (deprotonated), and a single bond to another O (from the ring?), but again, no -OH.\n\nTherefore, in the input molecule, the sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is not present. Instead, there's a sulfonate group (SO3-). But the user might be considering the sulfonate as the fragment, even though the SMILES given is -SO3H. That could be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to count the sulfonate groups as sulfonic acid in their deprotonated form. If that's the case, then the molecule has two such groups?\n\nWait, looking again, the input molecule has two sulfur atoms. The first one is part of the ring with two double bonds to O (O=S1(=O)), and the second is S(=O)(=O)[O-]. So the first S is in a sulfone group (SO2), and the second is in a sulfonate group (SO3-). The sulfonic acid group is SO3H. Therefore, the sulfonate (SO3-) is the conjugate base of sulfonic acid. If the fragment is sulfonic acid (protonated), then the sulfonate would not count. Therefore, the count would be zero. But that seems unlikely. Maybe the user made a mistake in the fragment SMILES, intending sulfonate instead. Alternatively, perhaps there's a protonated sulfonic acid group elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the entire molecule, are there any -SO3H groups? The only S groups are the two mentioned. The first S is part of a sulfone (SO2), which is different from sulfonic acid (SO3H). The second S is part of a sulfonate (SO3-), which is the deprotonated form. Therefore, neither is a sulfonic acid group. But this seems counterintuitive. Maybe the user is considering the sulfonate as a sulfonic acid group in the context of the molecule. For example, if the molecule is in a salt form, the sulfonic acid might be deprotonated. But the fragment name is \"sulfonic acid\", which implies the protonated form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is considering the sulfonate group as part of the count, even though the SMILES is -SO3H. In that case, the count would be 1, since there's one sulfonate group. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the first S is part of a sulfonic acid group. Let me check again. The first S is O=S1(=O)C... So, the S has two double bonds to O and a single bond to C. That would be a sulfone (SO2), not sulfonic acid (SO3H). Sulfonic acid would have S connected to three O atoms: two double bonds and one -OH. So unless there's a hydroxyl group attached to the first S, it's not a sulfonic acid.\n\nIn the input molecule, the first S is connected to two O via double bonds and a C and another O (from the ring?), but no hydroxyl group. The second S has two double bonds to O, one O- (deprotonated), and a single bond to another O (from the ring?), but again no -OH. Therefore, there are no sulfonic acid (-SO3H) groups in the molecule, only a sulfonate (SO3-) and a sulfone (SO2).\n\nBut this seems conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake in parsing the SMILES. Let me check the SMILES again. The input molecule's SMILES is: O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2)[C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1.\n\nBreaking it into parts:\n\n- The ring is S1-C-C-C-C-C1? Or S1-C-C-C-C1? Let's see:\n\nStarting at S1: O=S1(=O) means S1 is double-bonded to O and has another =O group. Then connected to C. Then C (from the C in C[C@@H...), then the [C@@H](Nc2ccccc2) which is a chiral carbon attached to an amino group (N) connected to a benzene ring. Then another [C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-]) which is another chiral carbon attached to the sulfonate group. Then C1, which closes the ring back to S1.\n\nSo the ring is S1 connected to C, then to C (from C[C@@H...), then to the two chiral carbons, then to C1. Wait, that's S1-C-C-C-C1. So a five-membered ring: S1, C, C, C, C1 (which is the last C connected back to S1). Wait, but S1 is connected to the first C, then the next C is part of the chain, then the two chiral Cs, then the last C1. So the ring is S1-C-C-C-C-C1? That would be six members? No, because the last C is C1, which connects back to S1, making the ring S1-C-C-C-C-C1? That would be six atoms. But I'm not sure. However, regardless of the ring size, the key is the sulfur groups.\n\nThe first S (S1) has two double bonds to O and is connected to a C. That's a sulfone group (SO2). The second S is in the substituent: S(=O)(=O)[O-], which is a sulfonate group (SO3-). Since the fragment is sulfonic acid (SO3H), the count should be zero. But this might be incorrect because the user might expect the sulfonate to be counted as a sulfonic acid group, perhaps in a different context. However, chemically, sulfonate is the conjugate base, and sulfonic acid is the protonated form. So if the molecule is in a solution where the sulfonate is protonated, it would be sulfonic acid. But in the given SMILES, it's written as O- (deprotonated). Therefore, the count should be zero.\n\nBut wait, the input molecule's SMILES has two sulfur atoms. One is a sulfone (SO2), and the other is a sulfonate (SO3-). Therefore, the answer should be zero if strictly following the fragment definition. However, maybe the user intended the sulfonate group to be considered as a sulfonic acid group. In that case, the count would be 1. But according to the given fragment SMILES (-SO3H), the correct count should be zero. Unless there's a protonated -SO3H somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first S is part of a sulfonic acid group. Let me check. The first S is O=S1(=O)C... So, the S has two double bonds to O and a single bond to C. That's three substituents. Sulfur can have up to six bonds, but in this case, it's possible that there's a fourth bond to another atom. Wait, the ring structure might include another connection. For example, S1 is part of a ring where it's connected to two O's via double bonds and two carbons (from the ring). So S1 would have four bonds: two double bonds to O and two single bonds to C. That would make it a sulfolane-like structure (sulfone in a ring). Still, that's a sulfone, not a sulfonic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct count of -SO3H groups in the input molecule is zero. But the second S has a sulfonate group, which is close but not the same. However, if the user intended to count sulfonate groups as sulfonic acid (perhaps in a different form), the count would be 1. But according to the given fragment SMILES, the answer should be zero. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the input molecule's SMILES: the sulfonate group is written as S(=O)(=O)[O-]. That's three oxygen atoms attached to sulfur: two double bonds and one single bond to O-. So that's SO3-, which is the conjugate base of sulfonic acid. Therefore, if the fragment is the protonated form (-SO3H), then the count is zero. But if the fragment is -SO3-, then it's present once.\n\nBut the user specified the fragment as -SO3H. Therefore, the count should be zero. However, I'm not sure if there's another -SO3H group that I'm missing. Let me check the entire SMILES again.\n\nThe input molecule: O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2)[C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is O=S1(=O), which is the sulfone group in the ring.\n- Then C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2): a carbon connected to a chiral center with an NH group attached to a benzene ring.\n- Then [C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-]): another chiral center connected to the sulfonate group.\n- Finally, C1 closes the ring.\n\nNo other sulfur atoms are present. So only the sulfonate group (SO3-) and the sulfone (SO2). Therefore, no sulfonic acid (SO3H) groups. Hence, the count is zero. But this seems counterintuitive because the user might have intended the sulfonate to be counted. However, the fragment SMILES explicitly is -SO3H. Therefore, the answer should be zero. But I'm not sure. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is considered as part of the sulfonic acid in the molecule. For example, if the molecule is a sodium salt of a sulfonic acid, then the sulfonate would correspond to the sulfonic acid in its deprotonated form. But the fragment is named \"sulfonic acid\", which would imply the protonated form. Therefore, the count should be zero.\n\nBut wait, the input molecule's SMILES has a sulfonate group (S(=O)(=O)[O-]), which is -SO3-. If the fragment were -SO3-, then the count would be 1. But the user specified the fragment as -SO3H. Therefore, the count is zero. However, the user might have made a mistake in the fragment SMILES. But according to the given information, the correct answer should be zero.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Maybe there's another perspective. Let's consider that sulfonic acid groups can lose a proton to become sulfonate, but in the SMILES, if the group is present as sulfonate, it's because it's deprotonated. But the fragment is the acid form. So in the molecule, the sulfonic acid group is not present. Therefore, count is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers the presence of the sulfonate as equivalent to sulfonic acid in the context of counting, even if it's deprotonated. In that case, the count would be 1. But according to strict SMILES matching, it's different. For example, the sulfonate is -SO3- and the sulfonic acid is -SO3H. They are different SMILES strings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be zero. But I'm not sure. Another angle: the fragment SMILES is -SO3H. Let's write that as -S(=O)(=O)OH. Comparing to the input molecule's S(=O)(=O)[O-]. The only difference is the -OH vs. -O-. Therefore, they are different. Hence, the count is zero.\n\nBut perhaps the user intended the fragment to be any sulfonic acid group, whether protonated or not. But given the SMILES provided, it's -SO3H. So the answer should be zero. However, I'm concerned that this might not be the case. Let me look for any other sulfonic acid groups. The first S is part of a sulfone (SO2), not sulfonic acid. The second S is sulfonate (SO3-). No other S atoms. So count is zero.",

The SMILES notation can sometimes be a bit tricky, so let's break it down. The molecule starts with N#[N+], which is a diazonium group\u2014nitrogen triple-bonded to a positively charged nitrogen. Then there's a benzene ring attached via a carbon (c1). The rest of the structure includes various substituents, like another aromatic ring (-c3ccccc3), and some more nitrogens in rings.\n\nThe fragment we're looking for is -N#N (diazo). But wait, the input molecule starts with N#[N+], which is a diazonium ion. The fragment specified is diazo, which typically refers to a neutral -N=N- group, but here the SMILES given for the fragment is -N#N, which is actually an azide group. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check: diazo usually refers to a structure with two adjacent nitrogen atoms, like -N=N-, but the SMILES given here is a triple bond. So perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is intended to be an azide group, which is N#N, but the name says diazo. That's conflicting.\n\nBut regardless, I have to follow the given fragment SMILES. The fragment SMILES is -N#N. So I need to look for that specific group in the input molecule. Let's look at the input molecule's SMILES again: N#[N+]c1[nH]nc2nnc(...)... The first part is N#[N+], which is a triple bond between two nitrogens, one of which is positively charged. The fragment we're looking for is -N#N (without a charge). So the input molecule has N#N+, which is not exactly the same as the fragment. The fragment is neutral, while in the molecule, one of the nitrogens has a positive charge. So does that count?\n\nWait, the fragment SMILES is -N#N. The input molecule has N#[N+], so the fragment here has a charge. SMILES matching usually requires exact matches, including charges. Since the fragment is specified as -N#N (neutral), the charged version in the molecule wouldn't match. Therefore, there might be zero occurrences of the fragment in the molecule.\n\nBut wait, let me check the entire molecule. Let's parse the SMILES step by step. The full SMILES is: N#[N+]c1[nH]nc2nnc(-c3ccccc3)c(-c3ccccc3)c12.\n\nBreaking it down: the main structure is a bicyclic system. The first part is N#[N+] connected to a carbon (c1), which is part of a ring. The ring has [nH] (a NH group), then another nitrogen (nc2...). Then there's another ring with nnc... etc. Are there any other N#N groups in the molecule?\n\nLooking at the other parts: after the first ring (c1), there's nc2nnc... The 'nnc' part would be two nitrogens in a row? Let's see: the 'nnc' is part of the second ring (c2). So positions around the second ring include two nitrogens (nn), then a carbon (c), etc. But those are single bonds. The only triple bond is the initial N#[N+]. So the rest of the molecule doesn't have any N#N groups. The only occurrence is the first two nitrogens with a triple bond and a charge.\n\nSince the fragment is -N#N (neutral), and the molecule has N#[N+], which is charged, they don't match.

The SMILES -SO3CH3 suggests a sulfonic acid methyl ester group. That would be a sulfur atom connected to three oxygen atoms (two double bonds, maybe?) and a methyl group. Wait, the SMILES notation here: SO3CH3. In SMILES, that might be written as S(=O)(=O)OCH3?

That would be a methyl group (C-O-) attached to a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)). Wait, but the fragment is -SO3CH3, which would be a sulfonate ester. So in the input molecule, the sulfonyl group is connected to a methyl ester. Let me check: COS(=O)(=O)... So O-S(=O)(=O)-... So that's O-SO2-O-C... Wait, the structure here is O-S(=O)(=O)-[C@@H]1... So the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a carbon (the CO- part). So that's a methyl ester sulfonyl group. The methyl ester would be OCH3, but here it's O-C connected to the rest. Wait, the input molecule starts with COS... So C-O-S. So the methyl group (C) is attached to the oxygen, which is attached to sulfur. Then the sulfur has two double bonds to oxygen (=O)(=O). So the group is O-S(=O)(=O)-... So that's a methyl sulfonate group: CH3-O-SO2-. That matches the fragment SMILES -SO3CH3. Because the fragment is the sulfonyl (SO3) connected to a methyl ester (OCH3).

Hmm, maybe I should draw this mentally.\n\nThe part after the ring is S(=O)(=O)Cl. That's the sulfonyl chloride group: sulfur connected to two oxygen atoms (double bonds) and a chlorine. The SMILES for the fragment is -SO2Cl, which would be a sulfonyl chloride group attached to something else. So in the input molecule, the S is part of the ring? Wait, let me check:\n\nThe SMILES is Cc1nn(C(C)C)cc1S(=O)(=O)Cl. The ring is formed by the atoms starting at the first C (methyl), then two Ns, then two Cs (cc1), and then the S is connected to the ring via the closure (the '1' at the end of cc1). Wait, no. The '1' in the SMILES notation refers to the ring closure. So the ring is: position 1 is the C with methyl (Cc1), then n (N), n (N) with a branch (C(C)C), then c (C), c (C) connected back to position 1 (cc1). So the ring is a 5-membered ring: C-N-N-C-C, connected back to the first C. Then after the ring closure (cc1), there's an S attached. So the S is outside the ring? Or is the S part of the ring? Wait, the SMILES is Cc1nn(C(C)C)cc1S(=O)(=O)Cl. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nThe SMILES starts with C (methyl group) attached to atom 1 of a ring. Then atom 1 is connected to n (N), which is connected to another n (N) with a branch (C(C)C, which is isopropyl). Then we have two c (carbon) atoms, which connect back to atom 1 (cc1), closing the ring. So the ring is: C1 (methyl) connected to N2, which is connected to N3 (with isopropyl), then C4 and C5, which connect back to C1. So a five-membered ring: C1-N2-N3-C4-C5-C1. Then after the ring closure, there's an S atom attached to C1 (since the ring closure is cc1, meaning C5 connects back to C1). Wait, no. The 'cc1' would be the two carbons (positions 4 and 5) connected to each other and then back to position 1. So the S is attached to the ring at position 5? Or maybe the S is attached to C1. Let me think again.\n\nThe SMILES notation is Cc1nn(C(C)C)cc1S(=O)(=O)Cl.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- C (methyl) is connected to atom 1 (c1).\n- Atom 1 is connected to n (N), then another n (N) which has a branch (C(C)C).\n- Then two c atoms (cc1), which close the ring back to atom 1.\n- After the ring closure (cc1), the S(=O)(=O)Cl is attached.\n\nWait, the ring closure is at cc1, so the two c atoms (positions 4 and 5) are connected back to atom 1. So the ring is C1 (methyl) connected to N2, N3 (with isopropyl), C4, C5, and back to C1. Then after that, the S is attached to C5? Or is the S part of the ring? No, because after the ring closure (cc1), the S is written outside. So the S is attached to the ring's C5. So the structure is: the five-membered ring with methyl on C1, two nitrogens (one with isopropyl), two carbons, and then the S is attached to C5. The S has two double-bonded oxygens and a Cl. So the group S(=O)(=O)Cl is the sulfonyl chloride, and it's attached to the ring. Therefore, the molecule has one sulfonyl chloride group. So the count should be 1.",

The input molecule's SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)NCC1CCCc2cc(S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3)ccc21.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES of the input molecule. Let me break it down. The molecule starts with NS(=O)(=O)N, which looks like a sulfonamide group because there's a sulfur connected to two oxygens (as S(=O)(=O)) and then a nitrogen. Then there's a chain: NCC1CCC... which might be part of a cyclohexane ring or similar structure. The next part is c2cc(S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3)ccc21, which includes another sulfonamide group attached to a benzene ring. \n\nThe fragment we're looking for is -SO2NH2. The SMILES for the fragment is -SO2NH2. Wait, in SMILES notation, the sulfonamide group would be written as S(=O)(=O)N. But the primary sulfonamide specifically means that the nitrogen is directly attached to the sulfonyl group and has two hydrogens (i.e., -NH2). So the correct group would be S(=O)(=O)NH2. However, in the input molecule, the sulfonamide groups might be part of a larger structure. Let me check the input SMILES again.\n\nLooking at the input: The first part is NS(=O)(=O)N... So here, the nitrogen is connected to the sulfur (as S(=O)(=O)) and then another N. Wait, that would be N-SO2-N... So that's a secondary amine, not a primary sulfonamide. Because the NH2 group would require the nitrogen to have two hydrogens. But in the input molecule's first part, the structure is NS(=O)(=O)N... So the nitrogen after the sulfonyl is connected to another carbon (NCC1...), meaning that it's actually a sulfonamide where the nitrogen is part of an amine group that's connected to a carbon chain. So that would be a secondary amine, not primary. \n\nThen, the second part is S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3. Here, the sulfonyl group is attached to a benzene ring (c3cccc(F)c3). The sulfur is connected to the benzene (c) and two oxygens. But where's the nitrogen here? Wait, the SMILES here is S(=O)(=O)c3... So that's a sulfone group (SO2) attached to the benzene. But there's no nitrogen attached to the sulfur here. So this part is a sulfone (SO2) but not a sulfonamide. \n\nWait, but the fragment is a sulfonamide, which is a sulfur connected to two oxygens (as SO2), a nitrogen, and that nitrogen must have two hydrogens (primary amine). So the correct structure would be S(=O)(=O)NH2. So in the input molecule, do we have any such groups?\n\nLooking at the input SMILES again: The very first part is NS(=O)(=O)N... So the first N is connected to the SO2 group and then another N. Wait, maybe the structure is N-S(=O)(=O)-N-C... That would be a sulfonamide where the nitrogen after the SO2 is connected to another N, which is part of a chain. So the structure would be NH-SO2-N-CH2... But in that case, the nitrogen after SO2 is bonded to another N, making it a secondary amine. Therefore, that's a secondary sulfonamide, not primary. \n\nThen, the other SO2 group is in the benzene ring part: S(=O)(=O)c3... So here, the sulfur is connected to two oxygens and a benzene ring. There's no nitrogen attached to the sulfur here. That's a sulfone, not a sulfonamide. \n\nTherefore, in the input molecule, are there any primary sulfonamide groups (SO2NH2)? Let me check again. The first part is NS(=O)(=O)N... So that's N attached to SO2, then another N. So that's N-SO2-N... The nitrogen in the middle (attached to SO2) would have two substituents: the SO2 group and the other N. Therefore, that nitrogen would have two substituents (SO2 and N), making it a secondary amine, not primary. So that's a secondary sulfonamide. \n\nTherefore, the input molecule has two sulfonamide groups, but both are secondary, not primary. Wait, but the fragment given is primary sulfonamide. Therefore, the count should be zero. Wait, but let me double-check. \n\nWait, the input molecule's SMILES starts with NS(=O)(=O)N... So the first atom is N (nitrogen), then S(=O)(=O), then another N. So the structure is N-SO2-N. But wait, the valence here: the sulfur is in the center, connected to two oxygens (double bonds), then to the nitrogen, and also to another nitrogen? Wait, no. Wait, the SMILES notation is NS(=O)(=O)N. Let's parse that step by step. The first N is connected to S. The S has two double bonds to O (=O), and another single bond to another O? Wait, no. The S is connected to two O atoms via double bonds (as indicated by =O), and then connected to another N. So the structure is N-S(=O)(=O)-N. So the sulfur is connected to two O (double bonds) and two N atoms. Wait, but sulfur can have up to six bonds. In sulfonamide, the sulfur is connected to two O (double bonds), one N, and another two substituents (maybe another O or a carbon). Wait, no, in sulfonamide, the sulfur is part of the sulfonyl group (SO2) connected to an amine. So the correct structure would be R-SO2-NR'R''. So in the case of primary sulfonamide, R' and R'' are hydrogens. So SO2NH2.\n\nBut in the input molecule, the first part is NS(=O)(=O)N. So the first N is attached to the sulfur, which is then attached to another N. So that would make the sulfur connected to two O (double bonds), one N (from the first part), and another N (from the second part). Wait, that might not be possible. Let me draw it mentally. The first N is connected to S. The S has two double bonds to O. Then, the S is also connected to another N. So the structure is N-S(=O)(=O)-N. That would imply that the sulfur is bonded to two O (as double bonds) and two N atoms. Sulfur can have an expanded octet, so that's possible. So the group here is a sulfonamide where the sulfur is connected to two O and two N atoms. The first N is probably part of an amine group. Wait, but how is the connectivity here? Let's see the full SMILES: NS(=O)(=O)NCC1CCCc2cc(S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3)ccc21.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is N connected to S. The S has two =O groups and another connection to N. So S is connected to N (from the first N), two O via double bonds, and another N. Then that N is connected to CC1... So the structure is: N-S(=O)(=O)-N-CH2-CH2-C... etc. So the sulfonamide here is the S connected to two O, one N (from the first part), and another N that is part of an amine group (N connected to CH2...). Therefore, the sulfonamide group here is -SO2-NH-CH2...? Wait, no. The N after the S is connected to the S and then to the C. So that N has two bonds: one to S and one to C. So that N would have a valence of 3. So maybe it's NH connected to S and then to C. Wait, the SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)NCC1... So the sequence is N-S(=O)(=O)-N-C-C... So the N after the S is connected to the S and then to two C atoms (since NCC1 would be N connected to C, which is connected to another C and the ring). Wait, maybe the N after S is part of an amine group. So the structure is: H2N-SO2-N-CH2-CH2... But that would require the N after the S to have another hydrogen. However, in SMILES notation, unless specified, the valence is filled with hydrogens. So if the N is connected to S and two C's (NCC...), then it would have three bonds: S, C, C. Which would make it a tertiary amine. Wait, no. Wait, the SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)NCC1... So the first N is connected to S. The S is connected to two O (double bonds) and another N. That N is connected to C. The C is connected to another C and then the ring. So the N after the S is connected to S and one C. Therefore, that N has two bonds (S and C), which would require two hydrogens to fill the valence (since N typically has three bonds). So that would be NH2-SO2-N-CH2... Wait, but the SMILES notation here is NS(=O)(=O)NCC1... So the first N (the one connected to S) would have the structure: H2N-SO2-N-CH2... But the N after the SO2 is connected to S and C. So that N has two bonds (S and C), so it must have one hydrogen. So the structure would be H2N-SO2-NH-CH2...? But I'm getting a bit confused here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first N is part of a primary sulfonamide. Let's see: the first part is NS(=O)(=O)N. If the first N is connected to S, and the S is connected to another N, but the first N has two hydrogens (making it NH2-SO2-N...). Wait, but in SMILES notation, the order matters. The NS(=O)(=O)N would be N connected to S, which is connected to O, O, and another N. So the first N is connected only to S. Therefore, that N would have two hydrogens (since it's a primary amine), making it NH2. So the group would be NH2-SO2-N... But then the next N is connected to the S and to the C (from CC1...). So the structure is NH2-SO2-N-CH2-CH2... But that would make the N in the middle (connected to SO2 and CH2) have three bonds: S, C, and maybe another bond. Wait, but the N after the SO2 is connected to S and C. If that N has only those two bonds, then it would have two hydrogens, making it NH2. But in the SMILES, it's written as NS(=O)(=O)NCC1... So the N after the S is connected to S and C. So in SMILES, unless branches are specified, the connections are in order. So the first N is connected to S. The S is connected to two O (double bonds) and another N. That N is connected to C. So the structure is N-S(=O)(=O)-N-C. Therefore, the N after the S is connected to S and C. Since nitrogen typically has three bonds, that N would have one hydrogen. So the structure would be HN-SO2-NH-C...? No, wait. Let me think again. The first N is connected to S. The S is connected to two O and another N. The second N is connected to C. So the first N (N1) has bonds: S and two Hs (NH2). The S has bonds: N1, two O (double bonds), and N2. N2 has bonds: S and C, and one H (so NH). Therefore, the sulfonamide group here is NH-SO2-NH-C... which would be a secondary sulfonamide, not primary. Because the nitrogen attached to the SO2 has one hydrogen (since it's connected to S and C and has one H). Therefore, it's a secondary amine, so the sulfonamide is secondary, not primary. \n\nThe primary sulfonamide would require the nitrogen attached to the SO2 group to have two hydrogens. That would be the case if the nitrogen is only connected to the SO2 group and one other atom (like a hydrogen or a terminal group). For example, NH2-SO2-... But in the input molecule, the nitrogen after the SO2 is connected to a carbon chain (NCC1...). Therefore, that's a secondary sulfonamide. \n\nLooking at the other SO2 group in the molecule: S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3. This is a sulfone group (SO2) attached to a benzene ring. There's no nitrogen attached to the sulfur here, so it's not a sulfonamide at all. \n\nTherefore, the input molecule has two sulfur-containing groups: one is a secondary sulfonamide (the first NS(=O)(=O)N part) and one is a sulfone (the S(=O)(=O)c3... part). \n\nBut the fragment we're looking for is the primary sulfonamide (-SO2NH2). In the input molecule, there are no instances where the sulfonamide nitrogen has two hydrogens. The only sulfonamide present is secondary. Therefore, the count should be 0.",

Starting from the left, O=C1 indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a ring. The next part is c2ccccc2, which is a benzene ring. Then there's another C(=O) group, so another carbonyl.

The input molecule's SMILES is COc1c(N2CCCC(N)C2)c(F)c(N)c2c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C3CC3)c12. The fragment SMILES is -cPropyl, which refers to a cyclopropyl group attached via a carbon atom.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let's break down the SMILES notation. The molecule has several rings and substituents. Let's start by identifying the rings. The main structure includes a benzene ring (denoted by the lowercase 'c' atoms in the SMILES). There are also several nitrogen atoms and oxygen-containing groups.\n\nLooking at the SMILES, I notice two instances of \"C3CC3\". The first is in the part \"n(C3CC3)\", which is a nitrogen atom connected to a cyclopropyl group (C3CC3 forms a three-membered ring, cyclopropane). The second occurrence is in \"N2CCCC(N)C2\", which is a piperazine-like ring (six-membered ring with two nitrogens), but that's a six-membered ring, not cyclopropyl. So the cyclopropyl groups are the C3CC3 parts.\n\nWait, the SMILES has \"C3CC3\" in two places: once after the 'n' (nitrogen) as \"n(C3CC3)\" and once in the main ring structure? Let me check again. The SMILES is COc1c(N2CCCC(N)C2)c(F)c(N)c2c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C3CC3)c12. Breaking it down:\n\n- The main ring is a fused bicyclic system. The 'c12' at the end indicates that atoms 1 and 2 are part of a fused ring. The substituents on the benzene ring include a methoxy group (COc1...), fluorine (F), amino groups (N), a ketone (=O), a carboxylic acid (C(=O)O), and a nitrogen with a cyclopropyl group (C3CC3).\n\nLooking specifically for cyclopropyl groups: the \"C3CC3\" in the SMILES represents a cyclopropane ring. Each time this pattern appears as a substituent, that's a cyclopropyl group. Let's look for all occurrences.\n\nIn the SMILES, there's \"n(C3CC3)\", which means a nitrogen atom connected to a cyclopropyl group. That's one instance. Are there any others? Let's check the rest of the structure.\n\nThe other part is \"N2CCCC(N)C2\". This forms a six-membered ring (since the index is 2, and the sequence is N connected to four carbons and another N, then closing the ring with C2). So that's a piperazine ring, not a cyclopropyl.\n\nAnother part is \"C3CC3\" connected to the nitrogen in \"n(C3CC3)\". That's the cyclopropyl group. Is there another occurrence? Let's see. The main benzene ring has various substituents, but no other C3CC3 groups. The rest are carbonyl groups, fluorine, etc.\n\nSo the total number of cyclopropyl groups in the molecule is 1. Wait, but wait, let me check again. The SMILES is COc1c(N2CCCC(N)C2)c(F)c(N)c2c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C3CC3)c12. The part \"C3CC3\" appears once here. So the cyclopropyl group is attached to the nitrogen in the \"n(C3CC3)\" part. Therefore, there's only one cyclopropyl group in the molecule.\n\nBut the fragment name is cyclopropyl, and the SMILES is -cPropyl. The SMILES for cyclopropyl as a substituent would be a cyclopropane ring attached via a single bond. In the given molecule, the cyclopropyl is connected via a nitrogen. The SMILES \"-cPropyl\" might indicate a cyclopropyl group attached via a carbon, but in the molecule, it's attached via a nitrogen. Wait, does that matter?\n\nWait, the fragment SMILES is \"-cPropyl\". The hyphen indicates the point of attachment. So \"-cPropyl\" would be a cyclopropyl group where the attachment is through a carbon in the cyclopropane ring. Let's visualize: cyclopropane has three carbons. The substituent is attached to one of them. So \"-cPropyl\" would look like C1CC1- where the hyphen is the attachment point. So in the molecule, if the cyclopropyl is attached via a carbon, then it's a match. But in the given SMILES, the cyclopropyl is attached to a nitrogen: \"n(C3CC3)\". The nitrogen is connected to the cyclopropyl's carbon. Wait, in SMILES notation, when you have C3CC3, the three carbons form a ring. The nitrogen in \"n(C3CC3)\" is connected to one of the carbons in the cyclopropane ring. So the cyclopropyl group here is indeed attached via a carbon (since the nitrogen is bonded to a carbon of the cyclopropane). Therefore, this matches the \"-cPropyl\" fragment.\n\nSo in this molecule, there's one occurrence of the cyclopropyl group attached via a carbon, which is the \"C3CC3\" group connected to the nitrogen. Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed another occurrence. Let me check the entire SMILES again. The input molecule's SMILES is COc1c(N2CCCC(N)C2)c(F)c(N)c2c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C3CC3)c12. Breaking it into parts:\n\n- COc1... : Methoxy group attached to position 1 of the benzene ring.\n- N2CCCC(N)C2: A six-membered ring with two nitrogens (positions 2 and the one after four carbons).\n- c(F): Fluorine attached.\n- c(N): Amino group.\n- c2c(=O): Carbonyl group.\n- c(C(=O)O): Carboxylic acid group.\n- cn(C3CC3)c12: The nitrogen (n) is connected to a cyclopropyl group (C3CC3), and the ring is closed between positions 1 and 2.\n\nSo the only cyclopropyl group is the one attached to the nitrogen. Therefore, the count is 1.",

The molecule starts with COc1ccccc1, which is a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring. The benzene ring is connected via a single bond (the hyphen) to another benzene ring: -c1ccc(...)cc1.\n\nLooking at the second part: c1ccc(CC(...))cc1.

The user wants to count how many times the fragment SMILES =N-O (which is an oxime group) appears in the input molecule.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the input molecule's structure. The SMILES given is O=C(CCCCCCc1ccccc1)c1ncc(-c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2)o1. Let me parse that step by step.\n\nStarting from the left: O=C is a carbonyl group. Then there's a chain of six CH2 groups (CCCCCC), followed by a benzene ring (c1ccccc1). So that's a hexyl chain attached to a benzene ring, connected to the carbonyl.\n\nThen there's another part: c1ncc(...)o1. This looks like a heterocyclic ring, maybe an oxazole or similar. The \"n\" would be a nitrogen, \"cc\" are two carbons, then an oxygen. The substituent on the third carbon (the -c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2 part) is a pyridine ring (since it's c2cc...ccn2) with a nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) attached.\n\nNow, looking for the fragment =N-O. The SMILES for the fragment is =N-O, which corresponds to an oxime group. Oximes have the structure R1R2C=N-O-R3, but in this case, the fragment is just =N-O. Wait, but in SMILES notation, the double bond would be part of the nitrogen's environment. So I need to look for any nitrogen connected via a double bond and then an oxygen.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES, let's check all nitrogen atoms. The first part is O=C... then later in the heterocyclic ring: c1ncc(...)o1. The 'n' here is part of the ring. Let's see the substituent on the third carbon (the -c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2 part). In this substituent, there's [N+](=O)[O-], which is a nitro group (NO2). The nitro group is O-N-O, but here it's written as [N+](=O)[O-], which is correct for nitro. So the nitro group has a nitrogen double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to another oxygen with a negative charge, and the nitrogen has a positive charge. That's the nitro group, not an oxime.\n\nThe oxime fragment is =N-O. So in the input molecule, are there any nitrogens that are double-bonded to an oxygen? Wait, no, the nitro group has N double-bonded to O, but in the nitro group, the structure is O=N+(O-). But the fragment we're looking for is =N-O, which would be like a nitrosyl group or an oxime. Wait, oximes are typically R2C=N-OH. So the structure would be a nitrogen double-bonded to a carbon and single-bonded to an oxygen (which is part of a hydroxyl group or another substituent).\n\nLooking back at the input molecule's SMILES, I don't see any such groups. The nitro group is present, but that's different. The heterocyclic ring has an 'n' (nitrogen) in the ring. Let me check the substituent again: -c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2. The nitro group here is attached to the benzene ring. The other part of the molecule is the oxazole-like ring: c1ncc(...)o1. The 'n' here is part of the ring. Are there any other nitrogens?\n\nWait, the substituent on the oxazole ring is -c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2. The 'n' in the substituent is part of a pyridine ring (since the substituent is a benzene-like ring with a nitrogen at position 2, perhaps). The nitro group is on that pyridine ring.\n\nSo in the entire molecule, the only nitrogens are in the nitro group, the pyridine ring, and the oxazole ring. The oxazole ring's nitrogen is part of the ring structure. None of these have the =N-O structure. The nitro group has N with double bond to O but not in the arrangement of an oxime.\n\nTherefore, the count of the fragment =N-O (oxime) in the input molecule should be zero.",

The input molecule's SMILES is Nc1cnc(-c2ccc(C3CCC3)c(OCC(O)CNc3cc(N)ncn3)c2F)cn1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES and identify all the nitrogen atoms that are part of primary amines. A primary amine has the structure -NH2, where the nitrogen is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom. In SMILES notation, this would typically be represented as NH2 or N with two implicit hydrogens.\n\nLooking at the SMILES string:\n\nNc1cnc(...)cn1\n\nBreaking it down:\n- The first part is \"Nc1cnc...\". The initial 'N' here is likely a primary amine. The 'c' following it suggests that the nitrogen is attached to a carbon (aromatic, lowercase c). So the first 'N' is part of an aromatic ring? Wait, no. Let's see: the SMILES starts with Nc1... So the nitrogen is connected to a carbon atom which is part of a ring (denoted by the numbers). Let me parse the structure step by step.\n\nThe entire molecule is Nc1cnc(-c2ccc(C3CCC3)c(OCC(O)CNc3cc(N)ncn3)c2F)cn1.\n\nBreaking down the main ring: the first part is a pyrimidine ring? Let's see: Nc1cnc(...)cn1. The numbering starts at the first N (position 1), then c (position 2), n (position 3), c (position 4), then the substituent, and then c (position 5), n (position 6), back to 1. So it's a six-membered ring with nitrogens at positions 1, 3, 6? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main ring is a benzene-like ring with nitrogens. Let's consider each nitrogen in the structure.\n\nLooking for all Ns in the SMILES:\n\n1. The first character is N (Nc1...). This N is connected to a carbon in the ring (c1). Since it's written as Nc..., this N is attached to the carbon. Now, in aromatic SMILES, the valence is important. If the ring is aromatic (lowercase c and n), then the bonding is aromatic. So the first N is part of an aromatic ring. In aromatic rings, nitrogens can have different valencies. For example, in pyridine, the N is part of the ring with two single bonds and one double bond. But in an aromatic amine like aniline, the NH2 is outside the ring. Wait, but in the SMILES given, the first N is directly attached to the aromatic carbon (c1). So maybe it's an aromatic amine? But aromatic amines typically have the NH2 group attached to the aromatic ring. However, in SMILES notation, if the N is part of the aromatic ring (like in pyridine), it's written as 'n'. So lowercase 'n' is aromatic, uppercase 'N' is not. Wait, no: in SMILES, lowercase letters indicate aromatic atoms, but nitrogen is usually uppercase. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in SMILES notation, atoms in aromatic rings are lowercase (c, n, o, etc.), but when specifying an atom with aromatic bonds, the atom type can be uppercase or lowercase. Wait, no, that's not right. The lowercase letters denote aromatic atoms. So 'c' is an aromatic carbon, 'n' is an aromatic nitrogen. So if an atom is part of an aromatic ring, it's lowercase. So the first N in the SMILES is uppercase, meaning it's not part of an aromatic ring. Therefore, the first N is a substituent attached to an aromatic carbon (c1). So this N would be NH attached to the ring. Wait, but the SMILES starts with Nc1... So the N is connected to the c1, which is part of a ring. Let me parse the entire structure.\n\nThe main ring is Nc1cnc(...)cn1. So the ring is six-membered: positions 1 (N), 2 (c), 3 (n), 4 (c), 5 (c), 6 (n), and back to 1. So positions 1,3,6 are nitrogens? Wait, position 1 is N, position 3 is n (aromatic nitrogen), position 6 is n (aromatic nitrogen). So the main ring has three nitrogens: one at position 1 (uppercase N, so not aromatic?), positions 3 and 6 are lowercase 'n', so aromatic. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to better understand the SMILES notation.\n\nIn SMILES, aromaticity is determined by lowercase letters. So 'c' is aromatic carbon, 'n' is aromatic nitrogen. Uppercase N is aliphatic nitrogen. So in the main ring: the first atom is N (aliphatic), then c (aromatic carbon), then n (aromatic nitrogen), then c (aromatic carbon), etc. But how can a ring have both aliphatic and aromatic atoms? That might not form a proper aromatic ring. Perhaps the main ring isn't fully aromatic. Alternatively, maybe the N at position 1 is part of a non-aromatic ring. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try to count the primary amines.\n\nA primary amine is -NH2. So any nitrogen that has exactly two hydrogens and one single bond to a carbon. But in SMILES, explicit Hs are not always shown. So how can we identify them?\n\nIn SMILES, if a nitrogen is written as N, it's NH3 (but that's a quaternary ammonium, which is not primary). Wait, no. The valence of nitrogen in SMILES is determined by the bonds. For example:\n\n- NH3 would be N (with three single bonds to H, but in SMILES, unless specified, it's implicit. So N with no branches is NH3 (like in ammonia). But when attached to other atoms, the number of Hs depends on the valence.\n\nWait, the rules for implicit hydrogens in SMILES: For nitrogen, the default valence is 3. So if a nitrogen has one bond (like in -NH2), it would have two implicit hydrogens. If it has two bonds (like in a secondary amine, -NH-), it has one implicit hydrogen. If it has three bonds (tertiary amine), no hydrogens. So, for a primary amine (-NH2), the nitrogen should have one bond (to a carbon) and two hydrogens. So in SMILES, this would be written as N (with one bond) or NH2 (explicitly). But in the given fragment SMILES, it's -N, which probably represents the primary amine group.\n\nSo in the input molecule, we need to find all nitrogen atoms that have exactly one bond (to a carbon) and two hydrogens (i.e., primary amines).\n\nLet's look at all the nitrogen atoms in the input SMILES:\n\n1. The first N: Nc1... This N is connected to the c1. Since it's written as N (uppercase), it's an aliphatic nitrogen. Let's check its bonds. The N is connected to c1 (aromatic carbon). If this is the only bond, then the nitrogen would have two hydrogens (primary amine). But wait, could there be other bonds?\n\nLooking at the SMILES structure: Nc1cnc(...)cn1. The main ring is Nc1cnc(...)cn1. So the first N is connected to c1, which is part of the ring. The ring is six-membered: positions 1 (N), 2 (c), 3 (n), 4 (c), 5 (c), 6 (n), and back to 1. Wait, but position 1 is N, then c1 is the second atom in the ring? Or is the first atom N, and then c1 is part of the ring? I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the ring structure.\n\nThe SMILES starts with Nc1cnc(...)cn1. The numbers after the atoms indicate the ring closures. So the 'c1' starts the ring, and the 'n1' at the end closes it. Wait, no. The numbers in SMILES indicate the positions where the ring is closed. For example, 'C1CCCC1' is cyclopentane. So in the given SMILES, the first ring closure is '1', which appears at the beginning and the end. Let's parse it step by step:\n\n- The first atom is N (aliphatic nitrogen).\n- Next is c1 (aromatic carbon, part of ring 1).\n- Then comes n (aromatic nitrogen).\n- Then c (aromatic carbon).\n- Then a branch starts with -c2ccc(...) which is a substituent at position 4 of the main ring.\n- After the substituent, the main ring continues with c (aromatic carbon) and n1 (aromatic nitrogen closing ring 1).\n\nWait, this is getting too complex. Maybe focusing on the nitrogen atoms and their bonds would be better.\n\nLet's list all the Ns in the SMILES:\n\n1. The first N: Nc1...\n2. The third atom in the main ring: n (aromatic nitrogen).\n3. In the substituent: C3CCC3 (a cyclopropane?), then OCC(O)CNc3cc(N)ncn3.\n   - Here, there's an O, then CC(O)..., then C connected to N: CNc3...\n   - The N here is part of a chain: CNc3cc(N)ncn3.\n   - So this N (CNc3...) is connected to a carbon, then to another c3 (ring 3?).\n   - In the part cc(N)ncn3: there's an N in cc(N), which is another nitrogen.\n   - Then n (aromatic nitrogen), c, n (aromatic nitrogen), and back to c3.\n\nSo let's count all the Ns:\n\n1. First N: Nc1...\n2. In the main ring: n (position 3) and n (position 6).\n3. In the substituent's chain: CNc3... (the N here).\n4. In the substituent's substituent: cc(N)... (another N here).\n5. Then n and n in the ring part of the substituent's substituent.\n\nNow, we need to check which of these Ns are primary amines.\n\nPrimary amines are -NH2. So the nitrogen must have one bond to a carbon and two hydrogens.\n\nStarting with the first N: Nc1... This N is connected to c1 (aromatic carbon). If this is the only bond, then it's NH2 (primary amine). But is there another bond? Since it's part of a ring? Wait, the N is part of the main ring. Wait, the main ring is Nc1cnc(...)cn1. The N is the first atom in the ring. So the ring is formed by N, c1, n, c, ..., and back to N. Wait, no. The ring closure is at the end: cn1. So the main ring is atoms 1 (N), 2 (c1), 3 (n), 4 (c), 5 (c), 6 (n), and then back to 1. So the N is connected to c1 (atom 2) and n (atom 6). Wait, that would make a six-membered ring where the N is connected to two carbons (c1 and n). Wait, no, because in SMILES, the numbers indicate the closure points. So the first 'c1' starts the ring, and the 'n1' at the end closes it. So the first N is outside the ring, connected to c1, which is part of the ring. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should use a SMILES parser, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the analysis.\n\nIf the first N is connected to c1 (part of the ring) and has no other bonds, then it's a primary amine (-NH2). But if it's part of the ring, then it's bonded to two atoms (the ring carbons), making it a secondary amine. Wait, but in a ring, each atom is bonded to two adjacent atoms. So if the N is part of the ring, it would have two bonds to the ring carbons. Then, the valence of N would be three. So two bonds to the ring and one hydrogen, making it a secondary amine (-NH-). But the first N is written as uppercase N, which is aliphatic, so maybe it's not part of the aromatic ring. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main ring is non-aromatic. For example, if the ring is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, but including an aliphatic N. But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated. Let's move to another approach.\n\nLooking for explicit NH2 groups in the SMILES. The fragment SMILES is -N, which represents a primary amine. So in the input molecule, any N that is connected to one carbon and has two hydrogens (i.e., primary amine) should be counted.\n\nLet's check each N:\n\n1. First N: Nc1... If this N is connected only to c1 (the aromatic carbon), then it's -NH2. But if it's part of a ring, then it would have two bonds. For example, if it's part of a ring, like in pyrrole, the N is part of the ring and has two bonds. But pyrrole's N is aromatic (lowercase n). Here, the first N is uppercase, so not aromatic. So if it's part of a ring, it's a saturated nitrogen. For example, in piperidine, the N is part of the ring and has two bonds. Then, it would have one hydrogen, making it a secondary amine. But if the N is not part of a ring and is just a substituent, then it's a primary amine.\n\nSo the first N is connected to c1 (which is part of the ring). Is the N part of the ring? The SMILES starts with Nc1... which suggests that the N is connected to the first carbon of the ring (c1), but not part of the ring itself. Because the ring closure is at the end with cn1. So the main ring is c1cnc(...)cn1, and the N is a substituent attached to c1. So the N here is -NH2, a primary amine. So count 1.\n\nNext, in the substituent part: OCC(O)CNc3cc(N)ncn3. The chain here is O-C-C(O)-C-N-c3... So the N here is part of a chain: connected to C (from OCC(O)CN) and to c3 (aromatic carbon in another ring). So this N is connected to two carbons (the C from the chain and the c3 from the ring). Therefore, it's a secondary amine (two bonds, one hydrogen). So not a primary amine.\n\nIn the substituent's substituent: cc(N)... This N is attached to an aromatic carbon (c). If this N is written as uppercase N, then it's -NH2 (since it's connected to one carbon and has two hydrogens). But in the SMILES, it's written as cc(N), which means the N is connected to the aromatic carbon. If the N here is part of an aromatic ring, it would be lowercase n. But it's uppercase N, so aliphatic. So this N is attached to the aromatic carbon and has two hydrogens (primary amine). So count increases to 2.\n\nThen, in the same substituent's ring: ncn3. These are lowercase n's, which are aromatic nitrogens. They are part of the ring and have two bonds, so they would have one hydrogen each (secondary amines), but since they're aromatic, their hydrogen count might vary. Aromatic nitrogens in rings like pyridine have no hydrogens. But in pyrrole, they have one hydrogen. So depending on the ring's structure. But since these are lowercase n's, they're part of an aromatic system and likely have one hydrogen (secondary amine) or none. Either way, they are not primary amines.\n\nSo far, the primary amines are the first N (count 1) and the N in cc(N) (count 2). Are there any others?\n\nLooking back at the main ring: the other Ns are lowercase n's (aromatic). So they are part of the aromatic rings and likely have one hydrogen (secondary amines) or none. Not primary.\n\nIn the substituent's cyclopropane: C3CCC3. No Ns there.\n\nSo total count is 2.\n\nWait, but let's re-examine the substituent part: OCC(O)CNc3cc(N)ncn3. The N here is connected to a carbon chain (OCC(O)C-) and to a ring (c3...). So that's two bonds, making it a secondary amine. So no count here.\n\nThe N in cc(N) is connected to one aromatic carbon. So if that's the only bond, then it's -NH2 (primary amine). So that's another count. So total of 2.\n\nAre there any other Ns? Let's check:\n\nOriginal SMILES: Nc1cnc(-c2ccc(C3CCC3)c(OCC(O)CNc3cc(N)ncn3)c2F)cn1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main part is Nc1cnc(...)cn1.\n- The substituent at position 4 (?) is -c2ccc(C3CCC3)c(...)c2F.\n- The substituent on that c(...) is OCC(O)CNc3cc(N)ncn3.\n\nIn the substituent OCC(O)CNc3cc(N)ncn3:\n\n- O-C-C(O)-C-N-c3cc(N)ncn3.\n- The N here is connected to C (from the chain) and c3 (start of a new ring).\n- The c3 is part of a ring: c3cc(N)ncn3. So ring closure at c3 and n3?\n- So the ring here is c3, c, c(N), n, c, n3, back to c3. So a six-membered ring with two nitrogens (n and n3). The N in cc(N) is attached to the aromatic carbon. So that's another primary amine.\n\nSo the two primary amines are:\n\n1. The first N (Nc1...)\n2. The N in cc(N) in the substituent's ring.\n\nTherefore, the count is 2.",

So right there, that's one cyano group. Let me check the rest of the structure to see if there are any others.\n\nLooking at the main chain: after the initial N#C, there's CC1, then a ring structure. The ring has substituents like n2cc(C(N)=O)c... which includes a carbonyl group (C=O) and an amine (N...), but not a cyano. Then there's another part: CCC(NCc2ccc(O)cc2)CC1. The NC here is a secondary amine (N connected to a carbon), but again, no cyano group.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The main chain starts with N#C-C-C-... so that's definitely one cyano.

The c3ccnc(F)c3 part is a pyridine ring with fluorine. The 'n' here is a nitrogen in the ring. The 'c' is aromatic carbon. So in this part, there's a nitrogen in the ring, but not a cyano group.

In SMILES notation, this would be something like OC(=O)O-R, but since the exact connectivity can vary, I should look for the ester functional group: a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to an oxygen connected to another carbon chain.\n\nLooking at the input SMILES, let's break it down. Starting from the left: CCCC is a four-carbon chain. Then we have OC(=O), which is the ester part (the carbonyl with an oxygen attached). So that's one occurrence of the ester group here: CCCCOC(=O)...\n\nNext, there's a benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1). Attached to the benzene is an NC(=O) group. Wait, that's an amide (CONR2), not an ester. So that's not counted. Then there's a C2(c3cccs3)CCOCC2 part. Let's parse that. The C2 indicates a ring. The substituents on C2 are a c3cccs3 (which is a thiophene ring, since it's c3cccS3), and a CCOCC chain. Wait, CCOCC is an ethylene glycol chain, like -OCC- but in a ring? The CCOCC2 suggests a five-membered ring maybe? Let me draw this out mentally.\n\nThe part after the amide is C2(c3cccs3)CCOCC2. So the C2 is part of a ring. The substituents on C2 are a thiophene (c3cccs3) and a CCOCC chain. Wait, CCOCC in a ring? If C2 is connected via CCOCC, that would form a ring. Let's see: C2 connected to C, then C-O-C-C, forming a five-membered ring? So the structure would be a ring where one of the carbons is connected to the thiophene. Now, in that part, is there an ester group?\n\nLooking at the substituents: CCOCC in the ring. There's an oxygen, but that's part of an ether (C-O-C), not an ester. So no ester there. The only ester group in the molecule is the first OC(=O) attached to the four-carbon chain (butyl group). Wait, but wait, the SMILES is CCCCOC(=O)... So that's O-C(=O)- connected to the butyl (CCCC), which would be the ester group. The ester is usually R-O-C(=O)-R', so in this case, the oxygen is connected to the butyl (R=butyl) and the carbonyl is connected to the benzene ring (R'=aryl). So that's one ester group.\n\nBut wait, let me check the entire structure again. The input molecule is CCCCOC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)C2(c3cccs3)CCOCC2)cc1. Let's parse this step by step:\n\n- The main chain starts with CCCC (butyl), then O, then C(=O) (carbonyl). That's the ester group: butyl-O-C(=O)- attached to the benzene ring. So that's one ester.\n\nThen, the benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1) has a substituent at position para (since the numbering would be c1ccc(X)cc1, so X is at position 4). The substituent is NC(=O)... which is an amide group. So the NC(=O) is part of an amide, not an ester. Then, attached to that carbonyl is C2(c3cccs3)CCOCC2. Let's see: C2 is part of a ring. The ring is formed by C2 connected to C, C, O, C, C. Wait, CCOCC2 would form a five-membered ring where C2 is connected to a C-O-C-C chain. That part is an ether (O connecting two carbons), not an ester. So no ester groups here.\n\nTherefore, the only ester group in the molecule is the initial one: CCCCOC(=O)-. So the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014could there be another ester group somewhere else? Let me check again. The entire SMILES string is CCCCOC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)C2(c3cccs3)CCOCC2)cc1. Breaking it down:\n\n- The main chain: CCCCOC(=O) connected to benzene.\n\n- Benzene has a substituent at another position (probably para) which is NC(=O) connected to a ring (C2...). The NC(=O) is an amide, so not an ester. The ring structure after that (C2(c3cccs3)CCOCC2) doesn't have any carbonyl groups. The CCOCC part is an ether in a ring. So no esters there.\n\nSo the count is 1. Therefore, the answer should be {\"count\": 1}.",

The rest of the structure includes a benzene ring with some substituents.\n\nThe fragment given is -C(=O)N. So I'm looking for a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a nitrogen. In the input molecule, there's an NC(=O) group. Wait, the fragment is -C(=O)N, which would imply the carbonyl is connected to the nitrogen. But in the molecule, it's N-C(=O), right? Let me check the order. The SMILES is written as NC(=O), so the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl carbon. The fragment is written as -C(=O)N, which would be carbonyl connected to N. But in the molecule, the order is N-C(=O), which is the same as the fragment. Because in SMILES, the order of atoms matters. So NC(=O) is equivalent to C(=O)N when considering connectivity, but the direction matters here. Wait, no. Let me think again. The fragment is -C(=O)N. So the carbonyl is part of the fragment, and the nitrogen is attached to it. In the molecule, there's an NC(=O) group. So the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl carbon. So that would match the fragment. Because the fragment is C(=O)N, but in the SMILES, it's N-C(=O). Wait, SMILES is directional, but the actual structure is the same. So the fragment is C(=O)N, which would be the same as N-C(=O) in terms of structure. So in the molecule, the NC(=O) is part of the amide group. So that would be one occurrence of the fragment.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other parts of the molecule where this fragment appears. Let me look at the entire structure. The main chain is COCCCNC(=O)... So after the three Cs (COCCC), there's an N connected to C(=O). Then there's a benzene ring (c1...) with substituents. The substituents on the benzene include a methyl group (C), a nitro group (nn-), which might be part of a ring? Wait, the benzene ring (c1) has substituents: C(C)nn(-c2ccc(F)cc2). Hmm, perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent that's another ring? The -n1cccc1 at the end is a pyrrole ring or similar. \n\nLooking through all the parts, the only occurrence of the fragment -C(=O)N is in the NC(=O) part. Let me confirm. The fragment is specifically -C(=O)N, meaning the carbonyl is directly connected to the nitrogen. In the molecule, the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So that's exactly the fragment. There doesn't seem to be any other place where a carbonyl is attached to a nitrogen. The rest of the molecule has other groups like fluorine-substituted benzene rings, methyl groups, and another aromatic ring, but no other amide groups. \n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.",

The input molecule is C=CCN1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)C(C(=O)Oc2c(OC)cccc2OC)C1, and the fragment SMILES is =O, which represents aldehydes or ketones in the side chain.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's SMILES and identify all the oxygen atoms connected by double bonds, which would indicate carbonyl groups. The fragment is =O, so each occurrence of a carbonyl group (like ketone, aldehyde, amide, ester, etc.) should be counted. But wait, the fragment name specifically mentions side-chain aldehydes or ketones. That might exclude carbonyl groups in other contexts, like esters or amides. Let me look at the structure.\n\nThe input molecule's SMILES is a bit complex. Let's break it down. Starting from the left: C=CCN1CCN... So there's a double bond (C=C) at the beginning. Then a cyclohexane-like ring (the 1CCN...C1 part). Let me parse the entire structure step by step.\n\nThe SMILES string is C=CCN1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)C(C(=O)Oc2c(OC)cccc2OC)C1. Let's expand this:\n\n- The main chain starts with C=C-C-N1-C-C-N(...). The N1 indicates a ring. The ring is formed by N1 connected to C-C-N(...)-C(...) and back to N1. \n\nLooking at the substituents on the ring: there's a Cc2ccccc2 group attached to the N, which is a benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2 is a benzene ring attached via a CH2 group). Then there's another substituent on the ring: C(C(=O)Oc2c(OC)cccc2OC). Breaking this down:\n\n- The C is attached to a carbonyl group (C(=O)), which is then connected to an oxygen atom (O) that's part of an ether or ester group. The O is connected to a benzene ring: Oc2c(OC)cccc2OC. Wait, the benzene ring here is o-substituted with two OCH3 groups? Let me parse that part: O-c2c(OC)-c-c-c-c2-OC. So the benzene ring (c2ccccc2) has two methoxy groups (OC) at positions adjacent to the oxygen connecting to the carbonyl.\n\nSo, the carbonyl group here is part of an ester: the structure is C(=O)O-aryl. That would make this a carbonyl in an ester group. But the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\". Aldehydes are RCHO, ketones are RC(O)R. Esters (RCOOR') have carbonyls but are not aldehydes or ketones. Similarly, amides, acids, etc., have carbonyls but are different functional groups.\n\nSo, in the input molecule, where are the aldehydes or ketones? Let's check again. The only carbonyl group I see is the C(=O) in the ester part. Wait, the ester would be the O-C(=O)-O-... So that carbonyl is part of an ester, not a ketone or aldehyde. Therefore, there are no ketones or aldehydes in the molecule. Unless there's another carbonyl I'm missing.\n\nLooking again: The SMILES is C=CCN1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)C(C(=O)Oc2c(OC)cccc2OC)C1. The only =O is in the C(=O)O part. That's an ester. So, no aldehydes or ketones here. The fragment count should be zero. But wait, maybe the user considers the ester's carbonyl as part of the count?

Then there's a benzene ring (c2ccc...) with a substituent S(=O)(=O) which is a sulfonyl group. The sulfonyl group is attached to another nitrogen (N3) that's part of a cyclohexane-like ring (CCC...CC3). Inside that cyclohexane ring, there's a carbonyl group (C(=O)) attached to another nitrogen (Nc4...). The c4 part is another aromatic ring, probably a pyridine-like ring since it's ncccc4C. Then back to the main structure with CC1C at the end.\n\nNow, looking for the fragment -C(=O)H, which is a terminal aldehyde. The SMILES for that would be C(=O)H. But wait, in SMILES notation, aldehydes are usually written as CHO. So maybe the fragment is equivalent to CHO. However, the user provided the SMILES as -C(=O)H, which would imply that the carbonyl is connected to a hydrogen. But in reality, aldehydes have the structure R-C(=O)-H, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. So the aldehyde group is a carbonyl with a hydrogen attached, and that carbonyl is at the end of a chain (terminal).\n\nLooking at the input molecule, I need to check all carbonyl groups (C=O) and see if any of them have a hydrogen directly attached. Let's go through each part:\n\n1. The first part is CC(=O)N1... That's an acetyl group (CO) attached to N. The carbonyl here is part of an amide (since it's attached to N). So the structure is R-C(=O)-N. The carbonyl here is part of an amide, not an aldehyde. So this one doesn't count.\n\n2. Next is S(=O)(=O)... That's a sulfonyl group (two double-bonded oxygens), not a carbonyl relevant here.\n\n3. Then in the cyclohexane ring: CCC(C(=O)Nc4...)CC3. The C(=O) here is part of another amide group, because it's connected to N (Nc4...). So again, this is a carbonyl in an amide, not an aldehyde. So no terminal aldehyde here either.\n\n4. The pyridine ring part: c4ncccc4C. No carbonyl groups here.\n\nAre there any other carbonyl groups in the molecule? Let me check again. The input molecule is CC(=O)N1c2ccc(S(=O)(=O)N3CCC(C(=O)Nc4ncccc4C)CC3)cc2CC1C. The other parts are the sulfonyl (which is S=O, but those are sulfone groups), and the two amide groups (C(=O)N...). There's another C(=O) in the cyclohexane ring: C(=O)Nc4... Again, that's an amide.\n\nWait, any other carbonyls? Let's check the end of the molecule: CC1C. That's a cyclopropane ring? Or maybe a cyclohexane? Not sure, but there's no carbonyl there.\n\nSo all the carbonyl groups in the molecule are part of either amides (C(=O)N) or sulfonyl groups (S(=O)(=O)), but none of them are aldehydes (C(=O)H). The aldehyde fragment requires that the carbonyl is bonded directly to a hydrogen, which would make it R-C(=O)-H. In the given molecule, the carbonyls are either in amides (bonded to N) or in the acetyl group (bonded to O and another C). The acetyl group is CH3-C(=O)-N..., so the carbonyl is part of an acetamide.

In SMILES notation, a primary amine would typically be represented as -NH2, but since SMILES often omits explicit hydrogens unless necessary, it might appear as -N with certain bonding.\n\nLooking at the input SMILES, let's break it down step by step. The molecule has several parts:\n\n1. Cc1cc(O)cc(C)c1: This is a substituted benzene ring. The 'O' here is an hydroxyl group (-OH), and there are methyl groups (C) attached. No amines here.\n\nNext part: CC(N)C(=O)N1Cc2ccccc2CC1. Let's parse this. The CC(N) indicates a carbon chain where a carbon is connected to another carbon and an NH2 group. The (N) here would be -NH2, which is a primary amine. Then there's a carbonyl group (C(=O)), followed by N1Cc2ccccc2CC1. The N1 here is part of a ring formation. The nitrogen is connected to a carbon (from the Cc2...) and part of a ring (CC1). Since the nitrogen is connected to two carbons (from the ring and the adjacent C), that's a secondary amine, not primary. So the N in CC(N) is a primary amine.\n\nThen the last part: C(=O)Nc1nn[nH]n1. The N here is attached to the carbonyl group (C=O) and a carbon from the ring (c1...). Wait, the SMILES here is Nc1nn[nH]n1. The nitrogen (N) is connected to the aromatic ring (c1...). The aromatic ring here is a tetrazole ring (nn[nH]n1). The N in Nc1... is connected to the tetrazole and another carbon (from the C(=O)). So, the valence here: the nitrogen has two bonds (one to the carbonyl carbon and one to the tetrazole ring). Wait, but nitrogen typically has three bonds. So maybe the N here is part of an amine. Let me check again. The group is C(=O)Nc1nn[nH]n1. The N after the C=O is connected to the carbonyl carbon and the tetrazole ring. If it's NH, then it's a secondary amine. If it's just N with two bonds, that might not be possible. Wait, maybe the N has another hydrogen. So in SMILES, unless specified, hydrogens are implicit. So the N in C(=O)N... would have two adjacent atoms (the carbonyl C and the tetrazole's C). So that's two bonds. Nitrogen usually has three bonds, so there's an implicit hydrogen here. So the structure would be NH connected to the carbonyl and the ring. That makes it a secondary amine (two carbons attached, one hydrogen), so not primary. So that N would not count as a primary amine.\n\nSo the only primary amine is the one in the CC(N) part. Let me check again the SMILES string:\n\nInput Molecule: Cc1cc(O)cc(C)c1CC(N)C(=O)N1Cc2ccccc2CC1C(=O)Nc1nn[nH]n1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The part CC(N) is where the primary amine is. The (N) indicates a branch, so that's a NH2 group attached to the central carbon. So that's one primary amine.\n\nAre there any other -N groups that are primary amines? Let's check all N atoms in the structure.\n\n1. In CC(N): N here is NH2, primary.\n2. In C(=O)N1Cc2...: N1 is part of a ring. The N is connected to the carbonyl oxygen's carbon and the adjacent C (from the ring). So, that's two carbons, making it a secondary amine.\n3. In C(=O)Nc1nn[nH]n1: The N here is connected to the carbonyl carbon and the tetrazole ring's carbon. As discussed, this is a secondary amine.\n4. The tetrazole ring has an [nH], which is a hydrogen attached to a nitrogen. That's part of the ring's structure but not a primary amine.\n\nSo total count of primary amines (-NH2 groups) is 1.",

The input molecule's SMILES is CCCCCCNc1ncc2cc(-c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)c(=O)n(C)c2n1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let me break down the SMILES. Starting from the left: CCCCCCN is a hexylamine group attached to a nitrogen. Then there's a ring structure. The main ring is c1ncc2cc(...), which seems to be a bicyclic system. The part inside the parentheses is -c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl. So, that's a benzene ring (c3cccccc3) with two chlorine atoms attached. Specifically, the c3 starts with a Cl substituent, then after a few carbons, another Cl. Wait, the SMILES is c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl. Let me draw that. The benzene ring has two Cl atoms: one at position 1 (since the first carbon after c3 is c(Cl)) and another at position 4 (since after three carbons, there's Cl). Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So positions 1 and 4 would be para to each other. But let me count: c3 is the first carbon, then c(Cl) is the second, then c, c, c, Cl. Wait, the SMILES is c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl. Let's number them. The ring is c3 connected to Cl (position 2?), then three more carbons, then Cl at position 6? Hmm, maybe I should draw it out mentally. The ring is c3 (1) connected to another carbon (2) with Cl, then three more carbons (3,4,5), and then Cl on carbon 6. Wait, but SMILES notation builds the ring as written. So the sequence is c3 (1) followed by c(Cl) (2), then c (3), c (4), c (5), c (6) with Cl, closing the ring back to c3. So in this benzene ring, the Cl atoms are at positions 2 and 6. But in aromatic rings, numbering can be tricky. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta arrangement. Regardless, the key point is that there are two Cl atoms in that benzene ring substituent.\n\nSo the entire molecule has two Cl atoms in the -c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl group. Are there any other halogens in the molecule? Let's check the rest of the SMILES. The main part after the hexylamine is the bicyclic system. The substituent on the ring is -c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl, which as discussed has two Cls. The rest of the molecule includes a carbonyl group (c(=O)), an N-methyl group (n(C)), but no other halogens. So total Cl atoms are two.\n\nThe fragment is defined as -X, where X is a halogen. Since the molecule has two Cl atoms, each attached as substituents, the count should be 2. Therefore, the answer is 2.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let me try to figure out how many ethoxy groups are in the input molecule. The fragment SMILES given is -OEt, which I know stands for an ethoxy group attached via the oxygen. The ethoxy group is -OCH2CH3.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES: CCOCn1oc(=O)c(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c1-c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the beginning: CCOC... So the first part is C-C-O-C, which is an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) attached to something. Then there's an oxygen connected to a cyclic structure. Let me break down the SMILES more carefully.\n\nThe molecule starts with CCOCn1oc(=O)... So the first four atoms are C-C-O-C (ethyl-O- connected to a carbon which is part of a ring, indicated by n1). Then there's an oxygen (o) in the ring, followed by a carbonyl group (c(=O)).\n\nNext, there's a branch: c(-c2ccc(F)cc2). That's a carbon attached to another benzene ring (c2ccc(F)cc2) which has a fluorine substituent. Then back to the ring with c1-... which connects to another part.\n\nThe next part is -c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1. This seems like another ring. Breaking it down: c1 connects to a chain of carbons. The part here is O-c2ccccc2O, which is a benzene ring with two oxygen substituents. Wait, the SMILES here is Oc2ccccc2O, so that's a benzene ring with two oxygens, probably as ethers or hydroxyls. But looking at the context, in the main molecule, the structure is O-c2ccccc2O. So that would be a benzene ring with two ether linkages? Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene with two oxygen-containing groups.\n\nBut focusing on the ethoxy groups (-OEt), which is -OCH2CH3. Let's look for parts of the molecule where an oxygen is connected to a CH2CH3 group.\n\nStarting from the beginning: CCOC... The first three atoms are C-C-O (ethyl group attached to oxygen), then connected to another carbon (C) which is part of a ring. So that C is the one attached to the oxygen. So that would be O-C connected to the ring. Wait, but the ethoxy group is O-CH2CH3. In the SMILES, the sequence is C-C-O-C (so the oxygen is between the two carbons?), but that might not be correct. Wait, SMILES notation builds the structure, so \"CCOC\" would be CH2CH2-O-C... Wait, no. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe SMILES starts with CCOCn1... So breaking it down:\n\n- The first 'C' is a carbon, connected to another 'C' (so a chain of two carbons: CH2CH2?), but that's not right. Wait, SMILES notation: each 'C' is a carbon atom. So the first part is C-C-O-C. The first two Cs would be a chain: C-C (ethyl group?), then O connected to the second C, then another C. So the first part is CH2CH2-O-C? Wait, that would be an ethyl group (CH2CH3) attached to an oxygen, which is then attached to another carbon. So that's OCH2CH2-C...? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is C-C-O-C, which would be: the first C is connected to the second C (single bond), the second C is connected to O (single bond), and O is connected to the next C (single bond). So that would be CH2-CH2-O-C... But ethyl group is CH2CH3. So O connected to CH2CH3 would be ethoxy. So if the SMILES has CCOC..., that would be CH2CH2-O-C..., but that would require that the first two Cs are connected in a chain. Wait, perhaps the first part is CCOC: the first C is connected to the second C (so CH3-CH2-), then O connected to the second C (so CH2-O-), then another C connected to the O. So that's CH2CH2-O-C... Wait, but that's actually O connected to CH2CH2-C... which would be OCH2CH2C..., but that's not ethoxy. Ethoxy is OCH2CH3. So maybe that's not an ethoxy group here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for the -O-CH2CH3 group in the molecule. The fragment is -OEt, which is -OCH2CH3. So in SMILES notation, that would be OCC. So any occurrence of O followed by CC (but not more carbons attached to the O). Let's scan the input SMILES for O connected to two carbons in a row.\n\nLooking at the input: CCOCn1oc(=O)c(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c1-c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is C C O C. So O is between the second and third C. That would be O connected to a CH2CH3 group? Let's see: the first two Cs are C-C, so that's CH2CH2? Wait, no. Each C in SMILES is a carbon with as many bonds as needed. So the first C is connected to the second C (single bond), the second C is connected to the O (single bond), and the O is connected to the third C (single bond). So the structure here is CH2CH2-O-C... but that would imply that the second C has two bonds: one to the first C, one to O. So that's CH3-CH2-O-C... So the O is connected to an ethyl group (CH2CH3), making it an ethoxy group. So the first part, CCOC, would be ethyl-O-C (OCH2CH3 attached to the next carbon). So that's one ethoxy group.\n\nThen, later in the SMILES, there's another part: Oc2ccccc2O. That's a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) with two O groups attached. One O is part of the OEt fragment? Wait, the Oc2ccccc2O part is in the context of O-c2ccccc2O. Let me see where that is. The SMILES has ...n1oc(=O)c(...)c1-c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1. So the part after the hyphen is -c1ccnc(...)n1. The ... inside is Oc2ccccc2O. So that's an oxygen connected to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2), and another O at the end. Wait, the SMILES is Oc2ccccc2O, which would mean the benzene ring has two oxygen substituents. The first O is connected to the benzene ring, and the second O is also connected? Wait, SMILES notation for benzene rings: each 'c' is a carbon in the ring. So Oc2ccccc2O would be O-C6H4-O. But how are they connected? The first O is attached to position 1 of the benzene, and the second O is attached to position 4 or something. But regardless, each O is part of an ether or hydroxyl group. However, the fragment we're looking for is -OEt (ethoxy), which is O connected to CH2CH3. \n\nIn the Oc2ccccc2O part, the O's are attached to the benzene ring, not to ethyl groups. So those are likely phenolic O's or ethers to other parts. For example, the O in Oc2... is connected to the benzene and maybe another part of the molecule. Wait, the full part is O-c2ccccc2O. So each O is a substituent on the benzene. Let me check the context where this appears. The full SMILES has ...nc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1. So the nitrogen in the ring (n) is connected to a carbon (c), which is connected to an oxygen (O), which is connected to the benzene ring (c2ccccc2O). Then, the benzene has another O. But those O's are part of ether linkages or hydroxyl groups. But they are not attached to ethyl groups. So those O's are not ethoxy.\n\nAnother place to check is the beginning: CCOCn1... So the first three atoms are C-C-O-C. The O here is between the second C and the third C. So the second C is CH2 connected to O, which is connected to the third C. So the structure is CH2CH2-O-C..., but that's actually O connected to a CH2CH2 group? Wait, that would be OCH2CH2-, but that's ethylene glycol or something else. Wait, no. Let's draw it:\n\nThe first C is connected to the second C (so CH3-CH2-), then the second C is connected to O (so CH2-O-), then the O is connected to the third C (O-C). So the group is CH2CH2-O-C... which would be O connected to an ethyl group (CH2CH3) if the third C is part of another structure. Wait, if the third C is part of a ring (as indicated by n1), then the O is attached to the ethyl group (CH2CH3) and the ring. So the OCH2CH3 is the ethoxy group. Therefore, the first part (CCOC) is an ethoxy group attached to a ring. That's one ethoxy.\n\nAre there any other ethoxy groups in the molecule? Let's check the rest of the SMILES. After the first part, there's oc(=O)c(...) which is an oxygen in the ring (o, which is lowercase, so possibly aromatic?), followed by a carbonyl group. Then there's a branch with -c(...), which is a carbon attached to another benzene ring. Then the main ring continues, leading to another part: -c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1. The oxygen here is part of Oc2ccccc2O, which as discussed earlier, is a benzene ring with two O groups. Those O's are connected to the benzene and possibly other parts, but not to ethyl groups.\n\nSo the only occurrence of an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) is at the very beginning: CCOC... which is O connected to CH2CH3. Therefore, the count should be 1.",

The \"Me\" here is a methyl group, so the fragment is a carbonyl (C=O) connected to an oxygen-methyl group (OCH3).

So that's one occurrence. Then there's a benzene ring (c1ccc...). The substituents on the benzene are at positions indicated by the numbers. The main chain after the first ester is c1ccc(-c2ccc(...)o2)c(O)c1.\n\nLooking at the substituent -c2ccc(C=C3SC(=O)NC3=O)o2: Here, there's another carbonyl group in the part SC(=O)NC3=O. Wait, let's parse that. The C3 is part of a ring: C=C3SC(=O)NC3=O. So the C3 is connected to a sulfur atom, which is connected to a carbonyl (C=O) and an NC3=O. Wait, maybe that's a ring structure. Let me draw it mentally. The C=C3 suggests a double bond between C and C3, then S attached to C3, then C(=O)NC3=O. Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic structure where C3 is part of a ring with S, N, and another carbonyl. In that part, there's a C(=O) group (the SC(=O)...), but that's part of a thiazine or similar ring. But does that carbonyl have an OMe group attached? No, because the substituent here is part of the ring and doesn't have an OCH3. The only OCH3 is in the first part, COC(=O), which is the methyl ester. Then, later in the benzene ring substituents, there's a c(O), which is a hydroxyl group (-OH), not an ester. So the only occurrence of the -C(=O)OMe group is the initial COC(=O). Wait, but let me check again. The input molecule is COC(=O)c1ccc(-c2ccc(C=C3SC(=O)NC3=O)o2)c(O)c1. The main chain starts with COC(=O), which is methyl ester. Then attached to the benzene ring (c1ccc...) is another substituent: -c2ccc(C=C3SC(=O)NC3=O)o2. Let's parse that substituent. The substituent is a benzene ring (c2ccc...) connected via a single bond. The benzene ring has a substituent C=C3SC(=O)NC3=O. Breaking this down: C=C3 suggests a double bond between two carbons, one of which is C3. Then, SC(=O)NC3=O. So C3 is connected to S, which is connected to C(=O), then N, then C3=O. This forms a ring: C3 is connected to S, which is connected to C(=O)-N-C3=O. So the ring would be S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C3, but the exact structure might be a five-membered ring? Let me see: C3 is part of a ring where it's connected via double bond to another C (C=C3), then S, then C(=O), N, and back to C3 with an oxygen. So the ring would be C3-S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C3? That might form a cyclic structure, perhaps a thiadiazole or similar. In any case, within this ring, there's a C(=O) group (from SC(=O)), but that's part of the ring and not connected to an OMe group. The other C(=O) in NC3=O is a carbonyl connected to an oxygen, but again, no OMe here. So the only occurrence of the fragment is the initial COC(=O) group. Therefore, the count should be 1. Wait, but wait. The fragment is -C(=O)OMe. In the input molecule, the first part is COC(=O)... which is OMe (OCH3) connected to the carbonyl. So that's one. Is there another one? Let me check again. The input molecule's SMILES is COC(=O)c1ccc(-c2ccc(C=C3SC(=O)NC3=O)o2)c(O)c1. The main chain after COC(=O) is a benzene ring (c1ccc...). The substituent on the benzene is -c2ccc(...)o2. In that substituent's part, there's a C=C3SC(=O)NC3=O. The SC(=O) is a sulfur connected to a carbonyl. That carbonyl is part of the ring structure, but there's no OMe attached to it. The other part is NC3=O, which is a carbonyl connected to an amine, but again, no OMe. The only OMe is in the initial COC(=O). Therefore, the count is 1.",

So the structure is N-C(=O)-CH3.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, the first part is CC(=O)N... So the acetyl is connected to the nitrogen. The next part is C(C)C..., so the nitrogen is connected to a central carbon that's connected to two other carbons (maybe a CH(CH3) group?).\n\nWait, the input molecule's SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)Cc1ccc(...)cc1. Breaking it down:\n\n- CC(=O): Acetyl group (CH3-C=O)\n- N: Connected to the carbonyl carbon\n- C(C)C: The nitrogen is connected to a carbon that has two methyl groups? Wait, C(C)C would be CH2C(CH3)? No, wait, SMILES notation is about connectivity. Let's parse it step by step.\n\nThe sequence is CC(=O)NC(C)C... So after the N, the next atom is a C, which is connected to another C (as in C(C)). So the nitrogen is connected to a carbon that has a single branch (C(C)), meaning that carbon has two substituents: one is another carbon (maybe a methyl group?), and the rest is connected to the next part (the Cc1ccc...).\n\nWait, perhaps the structure after the N is C(C)C. So the nitrogen is attached to a central carbon (let's call it C1), which is connected to two other carbons: one is a methyl group (C), and the other is another carbon (C) that is part of the chain leading to the benzene ring (c1ccc...). So the nitrogen is connected to a CH(CH3) group (since C(C) would be a carbon with two substituents: a methyl and another carbon). So the structure around the N is N-C(CH3)-CH2... leading to the benzene ring.\n\nBut the fragment we are looking for is -NC(=O)CH3. In the input molecule, the N is part of an amide group: the N is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) from the acetyl group (CC(=O)N...). So the N has two substituents: the acetyl group (COCH3) and the C(C)C group. Wait, in amides, the nitrogen is usually connected to two carbonyl groups or one carbonyl and another substituent. Here, the N is connected to the carbonyl (from the acetyl) and the C(C)C chain. So the amide group here is the NC(=O)CH3 part. Let me confirm.\n\nThe fragment SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. So the nitrogen is directly connected to the carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is then connected to a methyl group (CH3). In the input molecule, the beginning is CC(=O)N... So the acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-N...). So the N here is attached to the carbonyl. The question is, does this acetyl group attached to the nitrogen constitute the fragment -NC(=O)CH3? Because the fragment is written as -NC(=O)CH3, meaning the N is part of the fragment. But in the input molecule, the N is part of the amide linkage. Let me see: the acetyl group is CH3-C(=O)-N... So the N is connected to the carbonyl. The fragment is -N-C(=O)-CH3. So in the input molecule, the N is connected to the carbonyl (from the acetyl) and then to the C(C)C group. So the fragment as written would be present once here, because the N is attached to the carbonyl and the CH3 from the acetyl. But wait, the acetyl is CH3-C(=O)-, so the N is attached to the carbonyl, and the other side of the N is connected to the C(C)C. So the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 would be present once, because the N is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and the CH3 from the acetyl. But the N is also connected to the C(C)C. So does that matter? The fragment is -NC(=O)CH3, which implies that the N has two substituents: the carbonyl and the methyl. But in the input molecule, the N has three substituents? Wait, in amides, the nitrogen is typically bonded to two carbons and a hydrogen (if secondary) or three carbons (tertiary). Wait, let's clarify. The acetyl group is CH3-C(=O)-N. The N in an amide is usually part of a CONR2 group. So if the input is CC(=O)NC(C)C..., the N is connected to the carbonyl, then to two other groups: the C(C) and the C... So the N would have three bonds: one to the carbonyl, one to the C(C) (which is a CH(CH3)), and one to the next carbon (the C that is part of the chain leading to the benzene ring). Wait, that can't be right. Let me parse the SMILES correctly.\n\nThe SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)Cc1ccc(...)cc1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CC(=O): That's CH3-C(=O)-\n- N: Connected to the carbonyl carbon.\n- C(C)C: The N is connected to a carbon (let's call this C1) which is connected to another carbon (C2) and another carbon (C3). Wait, SMILES is written in a linear fashion. So after the N comes C(C)C. So the N is connected to a central carbon (C1), which is connected to a carbon (C2) and another carbon (C3). Then C3 is connected to the rest (c1ccc...). So the structure would be N-C(C)-C... So C1 is connected to N, C2 (which is a methyl group, since it's C(C)), and C3 (which is part of the chain). Wait, maybe C(C) is a branch. So the N is connected to a carbon that has a methyl group (from the C(C)) and another carbon (the next C in the sequence). So the structure is N-C(CH3)-CH2... leading to the benzene ring. Therefore, the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl, a CH(CH3) group, and a CH2 group. So the nitrogen here has three substituents: the carbonyl, a CH(CH3), and a CH2 group. But the fragment we are looking for is -NC(=O)CH3, where the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl and a methyl group. In the input molecule, the nitrogen's substituents are carbonyl, CH(CH3), and CH2... So the methyl group (CH3) is part of the acetyl (from CC(=O)), but the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl and then the acetyl's methyl is attached to the carbonyl, not directly to the nitrogen. Wait, no. The acetyl group is CH3-C(=O)-N... So the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl carbon (which is connected to the methyl). So the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 would be the N connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and the methyl (CH3). But in the input molecule, the N is connected to the carbonyl (which is connected to CH3), and then the N is also connected to the C(C)C group. So the fragment as defined is present once, because the N is attached to the carbonyl and the methyl via the carbonyl. Wait, but the fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. That would imply that the N is directly bonded to the C=O and the CH3. However, in the input molecule, the N is bonded to the C=O (which is part of the acetyl group), and the CH3 is attached to the C=O, not directly to the N. Wait, no. The acetyl group is CH3-C(=O)-N. So the N is bonded to the C=O, which is bonded to CH3. So the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 would be exactly that: N-C(=O)-CH3. So in the input molecule, that exact group is present once. The rest of the substituents on the N (the C(C)C part) don't affect whether the fragment is present, because the fragment is just the N connected to the carbonyl and the methyl. Even though the N has other substituents, the fragment is a substructure. Wait, but the fragment is written as -NC(=O)CH3. If the N in the input molecule has more substituents, does that mean the fragment is still present? For example, if the N is part of a larger group, does that count as the fragment being present?\n\nIn SMILES substructure matching, unless specified otherwise, the presence of additional substituents doesn't negate the match. For example, if the fragment is NC(=O)CH3, and the actual structure has N(C)(C(=O)CH3), then the fragment would still be present as a substructure. But wait, the fragment here is written as -NC(=O)CH3. The hyphen at the start indicates that the N is connected to something else (like a part of a larger molecule). So in the input molecule, the N is connected to the C(=O)CH3 (the acetyl) and also to the C(C)C group. So the N has three bonds: one to the carbonyl, one to the C(C)C, and one to the next group. Wait, nitrogen usually has three bonds. Wait, in the input molecule, the N is part of an amide group. Amides have the structure R-C(=O)-N-R1R2. The nitrogen in an amide is typically bonded to the carbonyl and two other groups. In the input molecule, the N is bonded to the carbonyl (from the acetyl), a CH(CH3) group (from the C(C)), and a CH2 group (from the Cc1...). So that's three substituents on the N. However, the fragment is -NC(=O)CH3, which implies that the N is bonded to the carbonyl and a methyl group. In the input molecule, the N is bonded to the carbonyl (which is connected to a methyl) and two other groups. So the fragment as written would require the N to be bonded to the carbonyl and directly to a methyl. But in the input molecule, the methyl is attached to the carbonyl, not directly to the N. Therefore, the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 would not be present. Wait, that's a critical point. The fragment's SMILES is NC(=O)CH3. The N is directly bonded to the C=O and the CH3. But in the input molecule, the N is bonded to the C=O (which is connected to a CH3), but the CH3 is not directly attached to the N. So the fragment is not present. Wait, no. Wait, the fragment is written as -NC(=O)CH3. The hyphen suggests that the N is connected to another part of the molecule. The fragment's structure is N-C(=O)-CH3. So in the input molecule, the N is connected to the C(=O), which is connected to the CH3. So the path is N-C(=O)-CH3. Therefore, the fragment is present once. The fact that the N has other substituents (the C(C)C part) doesn't affect whether the fragment exists as a substructure. Because in substructure matching, additional substituents are allowed unless specified otherwise. For example, if the fragment is NC=O, then any N connected to a carbonyl would match, even if the N has other groups attached. So in this case, the fragment NC(=O)CH3 would match any occurrence where the N is connected to a carbonyl that is connected to a CH3, regardless of other groups on the N. Therefore, in the input molecule, the N is part of NC(=O)CH3, even though it has other substituents, so the count would be 1. Therefore, the answer should be 1.",

That's the methyl ester group, right? The fragment we're looking for is -C(=O)OMe, which is exactly the OMe (methoxy) group attached to a carbonyl carbon. So the first part of the molecule, COC(=O), matches the fragment. That's one occurrence.\n\nNow, looking further into the SMILES string. After the first part, there's a benzene ring (c1cn...). Then there's a substituent attached via a nitrogen: Cc2ccc3c(...). Let's break down the branches. There's a -c4ccc(F)cc4 group, which is a fluorophenyl group. Then another part: cc(C(N)=O)nc3c2. Here, I see C(N)=O. That's a carbonyl group attached to an amine (NH2), which is a carboxamide group, not an ester. The ester requires an oxygen connected to a methyl group (OMe), but here it's NH2. So this part doesn't match the fragment.\n\nSo in the entire molecule, the only occurrence of the carbonyl methyl ester group (-C(=O)OMe) is at the very beginning: COC(=O). Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The input molecule's SMILES starts with COC(=O), which is OMe-O-C=O. Wait, the actual structure is OMe connected to the carbonyl carbon. The fragment is -C(=O)OMe, which would be OMe attached to the carbonyl. So yes, the first part is a match. Then, are there any other ester groups in the molecule? Let's look again. The rest of the structure includes C(N)=O (amide) and other rings. No other methoxy groups attached to carbonyls. So only one instance of the fragment. Therefore, the count is 1.",

The input molecule's SMILES is CC(=O)Nc1ncc2cc(-c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)c(=O)n(C)c2n1.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the structure of both the input molecule and the fragment. The fragment is an amide group where the nitrogen is attached to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a methyl group (CH3). The SMILES for the fragment is -NC(=O)CH3, which indicates that the nitrogen is connected to the rest of the molecule. The hyphen at the start means that the fragment is a substructure connected via the nitrogen.\n\nNow, looking at the input molecule. Let me parse its SMILES:\n\nCC(=O)Nc1ncc2cc(-c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)c(=O)n(C)c2n1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The molecule starts with CC(=O)N... which is an acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-N-...). This part is the methyl amide fragment. The acetyl is connected to a nitrogen, which is part of a larger ring structure.\n\nThe nitrogen (N) in the acetyl group is connected to a carbon ring (c1ncc2...). The ring structure seems complex, with another substituent (-c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl) attached, which is a dichlorophenyl group. There's also another carbonyl group (c(=O)) attached to a nitrogen with a methyl group (n(C)...).\n\nNow, the task is to find how many times the methyl amide fragment (-NC(=O)CH3) appears in this molecule. Let's look for all instances where a nitrogen atom is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a methyl group (CH3).\n\nIn the input SMILES, the first part is CC(=O)N..., which is exactly the methyl amide fragment. The nitrogen here is connected to the acetyl group (C(=O)CH3) and the rest of the molecule. So this is one occurrence.\n\nLooking further into the molecule, there's another part: ...c(=O)n(C)... This is another carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen. However, this nitrogen has a methyl group (C) attached (n(C)), so the group here is N(C)=O. But wait, the fragment we're looking for is NC(=O)CH3, where the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl and a methyl. In this part of the molecule, the nitrogen is part of a ring (as indicated by the lowercase 'n') and is connected to a carbonyl and a methyl group (n(C)). Wait, lowercase 'n' indicates an aromatic nitrogen. So this might be part of a ring, like in a pyridine or similar structure. The group here is N(C)=O, but the carbonyl is part of the ring? Let me clarify.\n\nThe SMILES string has \"c(=O)n(C)c2n1\". Here, the 'n' is aromatic, so it's in a ring. The 'n(C)' means that this aromatic nitrogen has a methyl substituent. The carbonyl (c(=O)) is adjacent to this aromatic nitrogen. However, the fragment we're looking for is a non-aromatic nitrogen connected to a carbonyl and a methyl. The aromatic nitrogen here is part of a ring, so even if it's connected to a carbonyl and a methyl, the structure is different. The fragment requires a single bond between N and C=O, not part of an aromatic ring. Therefore, this part (n(C)) with the carbonyl is not a match for the methyl amide fragment.\n\nSo, the only occurrence of the methyl amide fragment is the initial CC(=O)N... part.

The SMILES given is COc1cc2ncnc(Nc3cccc(Br)c3)c2cc1OCCC(=O)NO.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the SMILES structure. Let's break it down. The main structure is a benzene ring (the 'c1cc...' parts). The substituents on the ring are OCH3 (from COc...), then there's a more complex group with a ncnc ring attached. Then there's an OCCC(=O)NO group attached to the benzene.\n\nNow, the fragment is -O, which is a hydroxyl group. But wait, hydroxyls are -OH, right? But the SMILES here is -O. Hmm, maybe the user is referring to oxygen atoms in specific contexts. Wait, the fragment name is \"side-chain hydroxyls.\" Hydroxyls are -OH groups. So maybe I need to look for -OH groups in the side chains, not the ones in the main structure like ethers or esters.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, let's identify all the oxygen atoms first. The SMILES has several O's: COc..., then OCCC(=O)NO. Let's list them:\n\n1. The O in COc (methoxy group, OCH3) \u2013 that's an ether oxygen, not a hydroxyl.\n2. The O in OCCC... \u2013 this is part of the chain. Let's see: OCCC(=O)NO. Breaking that down: the first O is connected to the benzene ring via an oxygen (O), then a C-C-C chain. Then (=O) is a carbonyl group (ketone or ester?), then NO at the end. The NO would be a nitro group (O-N-O), but the structure here is OCCC(=O)NO. Wait, the SMILES is OCCC(=O)NO. So after the carbonyl (=O), there's an N connected to O. So the sequence is O-C-C-C(=O)-N-O. Wait, that might be O-C-C-C(=O)-N-O. Let me draw it:\n\nThe benzene ring has an O connected to a propyl chain (O-C-C-C), then a carbonyl group (C=O), then an N connected to an O. Wait, the SMILES is OCCC(=O)NO. So after the C(=O), it's N-O. So that would be a nitrooxy group? Like O-N-O, but attached to the C=O. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is O=N-O, but in this case, the connectivity is C(=O)-N-O. So the group is C(=O)-N-O. That would be a nitrate ester group: the O is connected to N, which is connected to the carbonyl. So the nitrate group is O-N-O, but here it's attached via the N to the carbonyl.\n\nIn any case, looking for hydroxyls (-OH) in the side chains. Hydroxyls are -OH groups. Let's check each oxygen in the molecule:\n\n1. COc... : methoxy (OCH3), not hydroxyl.\n2. The O in OCCC...: that's an ether oxygen (connected to the benzene and then to the propyl chain), so it's part of an ether group, not hydroxyl.\n3. The carbonyl O in (=O): that's a ketone or ester carbonyl oxygen, not hydroxyl.\n4. The O in NO: that's part of a nitro or nitrate group. Nitro is O=N-O, but here it's connected as C(=O)-N-O. So the O's here are part of the nitrooxy group, not hydroxyls.\n\nWait, but the SMILES ends with NO. Let me parse the SMILES again. The full SMILES is COc1cc2ncnc(Nc3cccc(Br)c3)c2cc1OCCC(=O)NO. The last part after the benzene is OCCC(=O)NO. So the chain is O-C-C-C(=O)-N-O. Wait, that would be O connected to C-C-C(=O)-N-O. The N here has two O's? Let me see. The NO at the end: the N is connected to the O from the carbonyl and another O. So the structure would be O-C-C-C(=O)-N-O. So the N is connected to two O atoms. That might be a nitrate group, where N is in the center with three O's, but here the SMILES is written as NO. Wait, perhaps it's O-N=O, but the SMILES notation might be different. Alternatively, the group could be a nitro group (O=N-O), but I'm not sure. In any case, these O's are part of a nitro or nitrate group, not hydroxyls.\n\nAre there any hydroxyl (-OH) groups in the molecule? Let's check. The SMILES has O's, but hydroxyls would be written as OH in SMILES. Let's look for OH groups. The input SMILES is COc1cc2ncnc(Nc3cccc(Br)c3)c2cc1OCCC(=O)NO. The only OH groups would be if there's an explicit OH. Let's check:\n\n- The benzene ring has OCH3 (methoxy), so no OH there.\n- The OCCC... part: the first O is connected to the benzene and then to the propyl chain. So it's an ether linkage, not a hydroxyl.\n- The carbonyl O is part of C=O.\n- The NO at the end: N connected to O. Are any of these O's hydroxyls? No, because they are part of a nitro or nitrate group. Hydroxyls would be -OH, but here the O's are connected to N, not H.\n\nWait, but wait. Is there any OH group in the molecule? Let me check again. The SMILES string: COc1cc2ncnc(Nc3cccc(Br)c3)c2cc1OCCC(=O)NO. I don't see any OH groups. All the O's are either in methoxy, ethers, carbonyl, or nitro groups. So if the fragment is -OH (hydroxyl), then the count would be zero. But the fragment SMILES given is -O. That's a bit confusing. The user says the fragment is \"-O\" and the name is \"side-chain hydroxyls.\" Maybe they meant oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups, but the SMILES is written as -O. Alternatively, maybe they are considering any oxygen in the side chain, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the fragment SMILES. Hydroxyl groups are -OH, not -O. But the user provided \"-O\" as the SMILES. Maybe it's a typo, and they meant -OH. Or maybe they are referring to ether oxygens, but the name says hydroxyls. Alternatively, maybe they are counting all oxygen atoms in the side chains, regardless of their bonding. Let's clarify.\n\nIf the fragment is -O (just an oxygen atom in the side chain), then we need to count all oxygen atoms in the side chains. Let's list all oxygen atoms in the molecule and see which are in the side chains.\n\nThe molecule has the following oxygen atoms:\n\n1. O in the methoxy group (COc...): part of a methoxy (OCH3) attached to the benzene ring. This is a side chain? Yes, methoxy is a substituent on the benzene, so part of a side chain. So count this O.\n\n2. O in OCCC...: this is the oxygen connecting the benzene to the ethyl chain (O-C-C-C...). This is part of the side chain. So count this O.\n\n3. O in the carbonyl group (=O): this is part of the side chain (the propyl chain leading to the carbonyl). So count this O.\n\n4. O in the NO group: the oxygen atoms attached to nitrogen. Are these part of the side chain? The side chain is O-C-C-C(=O)-N-O. So the N-O is part of the same side chain. So the O's here are part of the side chain. How many O's are in the NO part? The SMILES is NO, which is N connected to O. Wait, in SMILES notation, the order matters. The N is connected to the O, but what's the structure? Let's see: the part is OCCC(=O)NO. So the chain is O-C-C-C(=O)-N-O. The N is connected to the carbonyl C and to an O. So that O is part of the side chain. So that's one more O.\n\nWait, the NO at the end: the N is connected to O, but how? If the SMILES is written as NO, then the N is connected to the O with a single bond. But nitro groups are usually written as [N+](=O)[O-], but maybe in this case, it's a different structure. Regardless, the O is part of the side chain.\n\nSo total O's in side chains:\n\n1. Methoxy O: 1\n2. Ether O in OCCC: 1\n3. Carbonyl O: 1\n4. O in NO: 1 (or two if the nitro group has two O's?)\n\nWait, the SMILES for the fragment is -O. So each occurrence of an oxygen atom in the side chain would count as one. But the user specified \"side-chain hydroxyls,\" which are -OH groups. However, the fragment SMILES is -O, not -OH. This is conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nIf the fragment is hydroxyl (-OH), then the SMILES should be -O[H], but the user gave \"-O\". Maybe they intended to count all oxygen atoms in the side chains. But the name says \"hydroxyls\", which are -OH. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups (i.e., -OH), but the SMILES is written as -O. In that case, we need to look for -OH groups. But in the input molecule, there are no -OH groups. All oxygens are part of ethers, carbonyls, or nitro groups. Therefore, the count would be zero.\n\nBut that seems contradictory. Let me look again. The input molecule has OCCC(=O)NO. The last O in the NO part: is that an -OH? No, because it's connected to N, not H. So no hydroxyl groups here.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the fragment SMILES. If the fragment is hydroxyl (-OH), then the count is zero. If it's any oxygen in the side chain, then count all. But the user's instruction says \"side-chain hydroxyls\" which are -OH, but the SMILES is -O. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is considering oxygen atoms in alcohol groups (hydroxyls) but wrote the SMILES as -O. In that case, even though the SMILES is -O, we need to look for -OH groups. Since there are none, the count is zero.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in the input. Let me check the input molecule again. The SMILES is COc1cc2ncnc(Nc3cccc(Br)c3)c2cc1OCCC(=O)NO. Are there any OH groups? Let's check for explicit OH in the SMILES. The SMILES ends with NO. If there were an OH, it would be written as O[H] or OH. But I don't see any OH groups. All O's are part of other groups: methoxy, ether, carbonyl, nitro.\n\nTherefore, if the fragment is hydroxyl (-OH), the count is zero. But the user provided fragment SMILES as -O, which could mean any oxygen in the side chain. Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nCounting all oxygen atoms in the side chains:\n\n1. Methoxy O: 1\n2. Ether O in OCCC: 1\n3. Carbonyl O: 1\n4. Nitro O: 1 (assuming the NO has one O, but nitro groups usually have two O's. Wait, the SMILES is OCCC(=O)NO. The part after the carbonyl is N-O. So the N is connected to the O. But nitro groups are typically O=N-O. Maybe this is a nitroso group (N-O), but I'm not sure. In SMILES notation, the order matters. The N here is connected to the O, but how many O's? If it's written as NO, then it's N-O. But nitro groups have two O's. Maybe there's a typo in the SMILES. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitrate group, which would have O-N-O. But regardless, in the given SMILES, after the carbonyl, it's N-O. So that's one O attached to N.\n\nWait, but the actual structure might be O-N=O, but the SMILES would be written as O[N+](=O)[O-]. But in this case, the SMILES is written as NO, which is N-O. So maybe it's a nitroso group (N-O single bond). Regardless, the O in NO is part of the side chain. So that's one O.\n\nSo total O's in side chains: 1 (methoxy) +1 (ether O) +1 (carbonyl O) +1 (N-O) = 4.\n\nBut wait, the carbonyl O is part of the side chain. The carbonyl is in the side chain OCCC(=O)NO. Yes, so that's part of the side chain. So that's 4 O's.\n\nBut the user's fragment is \"-O\" (oxygen atom), and name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\". If they meant oxygen atoms in the side chain, regardless of their group, then the count is 4. But if they meant hydroxyl groups (-OH), then it's zero.\n\nThis is a conflict between the fragment name and SMILES. Since the user provided both name and SMILES, I need to resolve this. The name says \"side-chain hydroxyls\" which are -OH groups. The SMILES is -O. So this is conflicting. Which one to prioritize?\n\nPerhaps the user intended to count hydroxyl groups (-OH) but mistakenly wrote the SMILES as -O. Alternatively, they might have intended to count oxygen atoms in the side chain. But without further clarification, I have to make a judgment.\n\nIf I go by the SMILES fragment (-O), then count all oxygen atoms in the side chains. That would be 4.\n\nBut wait, the methoxy group is OCH3. Is that considered a side chain? Yes, it's a substituent on the benzene ring. So the O in the methoxy is part of a side chain. Similarly, the O in OCCC... is part of the ether linkage in the side chain. The carbonyl O is part of the side chain. The O in the NO group is also part of the side chain.\n\nThus, total 4 oxygen atoms in the side chains. But the name says \"hydroxyls\", which are -OH. If that's the case, the count is zero. But the SMILES is -O. So there's a contradiction.\n\nGiven that the user provided both name and SMILES, and there's a conflict, perhaps the correct approach is to follow the SMILES. Since the SMILES is -O, count all oxygen atoms in the side chains. But hydroxyls are -OH, so maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe in this context, \"side-chain hydroxyls\" refers to oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups, but the SMILES is written as -O.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring to oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups (i.e., -O- in an alcohol), but the SMILES is written as -O. In that case, the count is zero because there are no -OH groups.\n\nBut this is unclear. Given the input molecule, there are no -OH groups. All oxygens are in ethers, carbonyl, or nitro groups. Therefore, if the fragment is -OH, count is zero. If the fragment is -O (any oxygen in side chain), count is 4.\n\nThe user's fragment SMILES is -O, so perhaps they want the count of oxygen atoms in the side chains. But the name says hydroxyls. This is conflicting. However, since the user provided the SMILES, I should go by that. Therefore, the count of -O groups in the side chains.\n\nBut wait, in SMILES, each oxygen atom is part of a group. So for example, the methoxy group has one O, the ether OCCC has one O, the carbonyl has one O, and the NO has one O. So total 4 O atoms in side chains. So the answer would be 4. But if the user intended hydroxyls, it's zero. But since the SMILES is -O, the answer might be 4.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Let's recheck:\n\nInput Molecule: COc1cc2ncnc(Nc3cccc(Br)c3)c2cc1OCCC(=O)NO\n\nSide chains are the substituents attached to the main benzene ring. The main benzene ring has:\n\n- COc (methoxy)\n- a fused ring with ncnc (probably another aromatic ring)\n- Nc3cccc(Br)c3 (aniline group with Br)\n- OCCC(=O)NO (the long chain)\n\nThe side chains are the substituents attached to the benzene. So the methoxy (OCH3) is a side chain. The O in the methoxy is part of that side chain. The OCCC... is another side chain. The O in OCCC is part of that side chain. Then the chain continues to the carbonyl O and the NO group. All those O's are in the same side chain.\n\nSo in the OCCC(=O)NO side chain:\n\n- The first O (connected to benzene) is part of the side chain.\n- The carbonyl O is part of the side chain.\n- The O in the NO group is part of the side chain.\n\nSo in that one side chain, there are three O's: ether O, carbonyl O, and the O in NO.\n\nPlus the methoxy O: total 4.\n\nThus, if the fragment is -O in the side chain, count is 4. But if it's hydroxyl (-OH), count is zero.\n\nGiven the user's fragment SMILES is -O, but name is hydroxyls, which is conflicting. Since the user might have intended hydroxyl groups but mistakenly wrote -O, but the molecule has none, the count would be zero. But if we strictly follow the SMILES, it's 4.\n\nThis is a tough call. However, since the user provided the SMILES as -O, perhaps they intended to count all oxygen atoms in the side chains. Therefore, the count is 4.\n\nWait, but I should verify again. Let's list all O's:\n\n1. Methoxy O: 1\n2. Ether O in OCCC: 1\n3. Carbonyl O: 1\n4. O in NO: 1 (or is there another O in the NO group?)\n\nWait, the SMILES for the nitro part is NO. In SMILES, that would be N-O. But nitro groups are typically written with two O's. For example, nitro is [N+](=O)[O-]. So maybe the actual structure here is a nitro group, but the SMILES is written differently. However, the user's input SMILES is OCCC(=O)NO. So the N is connected to the O. If that's the case, perhaps there's only one O in that group. But that's unlikely; nitro groups have two O's. Maybe there's a typo in the SMILES. Alternatively, it's a nitroso group (N-O single bond), which has one O. So in this case, the NO part has one O. Therefore, total O's in side chains: 4.\n\nBut if the nitro group is actually written correctly as [N+](=O)[O-], then there would be two O's there. But the given SMILES is NO, which is N-O. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the SMILES, but we have to work with what's given.\n\nTherefore, based on the given SMILES, the NO part has one O. Thus, total O's in side chains: 4.\n\nSo the final answer is 4. But wait, the user's fragment name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\", which are -OH groups. However, the SMILES is -O. If the user intended hydroxyl groups, the count is zero. But if they meant oxygen atoms in the side chain, it's 4. This is a conflict.\n\nIn such cases, it's better to follow the SMILES since it's explicit. Therefore, the count is 4. But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user considers the oxygen in the methoxy group as part of the side chain hydroxyl. But methoxy is -OCH3, not a hydroxyl. Hydroxyl is -OH. So methoxy's O is not a hydroxyl.\n\nSimilarly, the O in the ether (OCCC) is part of an ether group, not hydroxyl.\n\nThe carbonyl O is part of a ketone or ester, not hydroxyl.\n\nThe O in NO is part of a nitro or nitroso group, not hydroxyl.\n\nTherefore, all O's in the side chains are not hydroxyls. Thus, even if the fragment name says hydroxyls, but the SMILES is -O, the count would be zero if we consider hydroxyls. But the SMILES is -O, which could be any oxygen. This is very confusing.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but since the user provided both name and SMILES, and there's a conflict, perhaps the correct approach is to go with the SMILES and count all O's in the side chains. But that would be 4. However, if the name is correct and the SMILES is wrong, then count zero. But I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user considers the oxygen in the nitrate group (if that's what NO is) as a hydroxyl, but that's not accurate.\n\nGiven the confusion, but based on the information provided, the correct answer is either 4 or 0. But which one is right? I need to make a decision.\n\nGiven the SMILES fragment is -O, and the name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\", but hydroxyls are -OH, I think there's a mistake. However, since the user is asking for the count based on the fragment SMILES, the answer is 4. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to count hydroxyl groups and made a mistake in the SMILES. If that's the case, the count is zero.\n\nBut without further clarification, I have to proceed. Given the strict instruction to use the fragment SMILES, the count is 4. However, another possibility is that the user intended the hydroxyl groups (which would be -OH), but wrote the SMILES as -O. In that case, the count is zero. This is a tricky situation.\n\nBut given the input molecule has no -OH groups, the count for hydroxyls is zero. So the correct answer should be zero. Therefore, despite the fragment SMILES being -O, the name says hydroxyls, which are -OH. Therefore, the count is zero.\n\nBut I'm torn. The user might have intended to count all O's in the side chain, but named it hydroxyls by mistake. But since the name and SMILES conflict, it's ambiguous. However, the correct chemical answer for hydroxyls (-OH) is zero. Therefore, the count should be zero.",

The input molecule's SMILES is N#Cc1ccc(Oc2ccc(NC(=O)CC(CC(=O)O)c3ccccc3)cc2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES of the input molecule. Let's break it down. Starting from the left: N#C is a nitrile group attached to a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1). The benzene ring has an oxygen connected to another benzene ring (Oc2ccc...cc2). The second benzene ring has an NC(=O) group, which is an amide. Then there's a CC(CC(=O)O) chain. Wait, let me visualize this part.\n\nThe chain after the amide (NC(=O)) is CC(CC(=O)O). So, starting from the amide: the carbonyl carbon (C=O) is connected to a CH2 group (the first C), which is connected to another CH2 group (the second C). That second CH2 has two branches: one is another CH2 connected to a carbonyl group (C(=O)O), and the other is the rest of the molecule. Wait, maybe I should draw this structure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for all occurrences of the fragment -C(=O)O. The SMILES for the fragment is -C(=O)O, which means a carboxylic acid group attached to something else. The carboxylic acid group is -C(=O)OH, but in the fragment SMILES here, it's written as -C(=O)O. Wait, the SMILES notation for a carboxylic acid would typically be -C(=O)OH. But in the fragment, it's written as -C(=O)O. Maybe the user is considering the deprotonated form or just the functional group without the hydrogen. However, in the input molecule, we need to check if there's a -C(=O)O- group as part of a larger structure.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES: let's parse it step by step. The main structure is a benzene ring (c1ccc(Oc2ccc(...)cc2)cc1) with a nitrile group (N#C) attached. The oxygen (O) connects to another benzene ring (c2ccc(...)cc2). On this second benzene ring, there's an NC(=O) group (amide), followed by CC(CC(=O)O). Let's break that down: after the amide (NC(=O)), there's a carbon chain: C connected to another C, which has two branches: one is another CC(=O)O, and the other is part of the rest of the molecule. Wait, maybe the structure is NC(=O)CC(CC(=O)O)c3ccccc3. So, the amide (NC(=O)) is connected to a CH2 (the first C), which is connected to a CH (the second C) that branches into another CH2 (the third C) leading to a C(=O)O group. So the branch here would be: the central CH has two CH2 groups, one leading to the benzene ring (c3ccccc3) and the other to the C(=O)O group.\n\nTherefore, in the input molecule, there's a single occurrence of the CC(=O)O group. But wait, let's check again. The part after the amide is CC(CC(=O)O). So the structure is:\n\nNC(=O)-C-CH2-C(=O)O\n\nWait, no. Let's parse the SMILES part NC(=O)CC(CC(=O)O)c3ccccc3. The amide group is NC(=O). Then there's CC(CC(=O)O). So the first C after the amide is connected to another C, which has two substituents: one is a CC(=O)O group and the other is the benzene ring (c3ccccc3). So the central carbon (the one after the first C) is connected to a CH2 group (the CC part) leading to C(=O)O. Therefore, that's one occurrence of the -C(=O)O group.\n\nIs there another occurrence? Let's look through the rest of the molecule. The main benzene ring has the nitrile group and the oxygen connecting to the second benzene ring. The second benzene ring has the amide group and the chain leading to the carboxylic acid group. Are there any other carbonyl groups? The amide has a C(=O), but that's part of an amide, not a carboxylic acid. The only C(=O)O group is in the CC(=O)O part. So the count should be 1.",

The input molecule's SMILES is CCCCOC(=O)CC1N=C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)c2cc(OC)ccc2-n2c(C)nnc21.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that the methoxy group is represented by the SMILES notation \"OC\" where the oxygen is connected to a methyl group. Wait, actually, methoxy is O-C, so the correct SMILES for methoxy (-OCH3) should be O-C, but sometimes written as OC when the methyl is implied. Hmm, but in SMILES notation, the order matters. So methoxy would be written as O-C-CH3? Or is it OCH3? Let me think. Methoxy is an oxygen connected to a methyl group. So the SMILES would be O-C, but since the methyl is CH3, maybe it's O-C. Wait, the fragment SMILES given here is \"-OMe\", which is a common shorthand. But in actual SMILES notation, methoxy is OCH3. So the SMILES for methoxy is OCH3, which would be written as OC in SMILES, because the methyl (CH3) is implied by the C connected to the O. Wait, no. Let me clarify: the methoxy group is -O-CH3. In SMILES, that would be written as O-C. But the C here would have three Hs, right? So the correct SMILES is O-C (but the C is part of the methyl group). However, in the given fragment SMILES, it's \"-OMe\". \"Me\" in SMILES stands for a methyl group, so \"-OMe\" would translate to -O-CH3. So the SMILES for the fragment is O-C. But how does that appear in the input molecule?\n\nLooking at the input SMILES: CCCCOC(=O)CC1N=C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)c2cc(OC)ccc2-n2c(C)nnc21.\n\nLet me parse this step by step. The main chain starts with CCCC (four carbons in a row), then O, then C(=O) which is a carbonyl group. Then CC1N=... etc. But let's look for OC groups. The part that says c2cc(OC)ccc2: here, the c2 is a benzene ring (since lowercase c denotes aromatic carbon). The cc(OC) part: so positions on the ring. The OC here is attached to one of the carbons in the ring. So that's an O connected to a CH3 (since OC would be O-C, but in aromatic context, maybe it's OCH3). Wait, in SMILES, OC in an aromatic context might be part of the ring? Wait, no. The OC here is in parentheses, so it's a substituent. The part c2cc(OC)ccc2: the third carbon in the ring (since it's c2cc(OC)) has an OC group attached. So that OC would be O-C, but since it's a substituent, the C here is a methyl group. So that's a methoxy group. So that's one occurrence.\n\nAre there any other OC groups in the molecule? Let's check the rest of the SMILES. The main chain after the carbonyl is CC1N=C(...). Then there's a part with c2ccc(Cl)cc2, which is another benzene ring with a Cl substituent. Then the part after that is c2cc(OC)ccc2, which we already considered. The last part is -n2c(C)nnc21. That's a ring with nitrogens. No OC there.\n\nSo in the entire SMILES, the only occurrence of OC as a substituent is in the c2cc(OC)ccc2 part. Wait, but wait: OC(=O) is part of the main chain. That's a carbonyl group (O=C-O), but that's an ester group, not a methoxy. So OC(=O) would be an ester group, where the O is connected to the carbonyl carbon, not a methyl group. So that's not a methoxy.\n\nSo the only OC substituent is in the benzene ring, which is one methoxy group. Therefore, the count should be 1. But wait, let me double-check. The fragment SMILES given is \"-OMe\", which is methoxy. The input molecule's SMILES has OC as a substituent in the aromatic ring. Since OC in SMILES (without any branching) would be O-C, but in the context of a substituent on an aromatic ring, that O is connected to a methyl group (CH3), making it a methoxy group. So that's one occurrence. Are there any others?\n\nLooking again: The input SMILES is CCCCOC(=O)CC1N=C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)c2cc(OC)ccc2-n2c(C)nnc21.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CCCCOC(=O)CC... : the O here is part of an ester group (OC(=O)), not methoxy.\n\nThen after CC, there's a ring structure: 1N=C(...). The part inside the ring includes c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (a benzene with Cl), then c2cc(OC)ccc2 (another benzene with OC substituent), and the rest.\n\nSo the only OC substituent is in the second benzene ring.

The \"c1\" indicates that this is part of a benzene-like ring.\n\nLooking at the structure, the main ring is a five-membered ring because the numbering goes up to [nH]1. Let me break down the structure:\n\n- The first part is CSc1nc(...)[nH]1.

The input molecule's SMILES is CCOC(=O)Nc1ncc(Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C)c(N)n1. The fragment SMILES for ethoxy is -OEt, which I think corresponds to an ethoxy group, meaning -OCH2CH3.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let's break down the SMILES:\n\nStarting with CCOC(=O)Nc1ncc(...)c(N)n1. The beginning part is CCOC(=O)N- which is ethyl carbamate (the CCO is ethyl, then O connected to carbonyl, then N). Then there's a ring structure: c1ncc(...)c(N)n1. The ring is a 5-membered ring with two nitrogens. \n\nLooking at the substituents on the ring: there's an O connected to another ring, which is Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C. Let me parse that. The O is part of a benzene ring (c2cc...cc2). The benzene ring has substituents: at position 2 (assuming numbering starts where O is attached), there's an iodine (I), then a methoxy group (OC, which is -OCH3), and a branch with C(C)C, which is a tert-butyl group (since it's C(C)C attached to another carbon in the ring). \n\nWait, but the fragment in question is ethoxy (-OEt), which is -OCH2CH3. Let me check where ethoxy groups might be present in the input molecule.\n\nLooking at the SMILES: the main chain starts with CCO, which is ethyl (CH2CH3), then O connected to carbonyl. So that part is O attached to ethyl, but that's part of the ethyl carbamate group (CCOC(=O)N...), so that's an ester group, not an ethoxy. Then, in the benzene ring part (Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C), there's an OC (methoxy) group. So OC here is -OCH3. But the fragment we're looking for is ethoxy (-OCH2CH3). \n\nSo, in the input SMILES, are there any ethoxy groups? Let's check all oxygen atoms connected to alkyl chains. The main chain has CCO (ethyl) attached to O, but that O is part of the carbonyl group (C(=O)), so that's an ester group. The O in the ester is part of the carbonyl, not a simple alkoxy. Then, in the benzene ring substituent, there's OC (O connected to CH3), which is methoxy. Then, the other substituents are I, tert-butyl. \n\nWait, the SMILES for the fragment is -OEt, which is -OCH2CH3. So looking for any O connected to ethyl groups. Let me check again. The input molecule's SMILES starts with CCOC(=O)... The CCO here is ethyl (CH2CH2), but the O is part of the carbonyl group. So the ethyl is connected to O, which is double-bonded to C. That's an ester group (ethyl ester), not an ethoxy. Ethoxy would be O connected to ethyl as a single bond, like -O-CH2CH3. \n\nLooking further into the molecule, after the carbamate group, there's the ring. The benzene ring substituent has Oc2... which is O connected to the benzene ring. The substituents on that benzene include OC (methoxy) and the tert-butyl. So the Oc2 part is an oxygen connected to the benzene and then to another carbon chain. Wait, the benzene ring is c2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C. Let me parse that again. The ring is c2 (start), then cc(I) means two carbons, one with I. Then c(OC) is a carbon connected to OC (methoxy). Then cc2C(C)C: the next two carbons in the ring, then a branch to C(C)C, which is a tert-butyl group. So the O in Oc2 is connected to the benzene ring and then to a carbon. Wait, no, Oc2 would mean that the oxygen is connected to the benzene ring (c2 is the benzene ring), so the structure is O-c2... So the O is directly attached to the benzene ring, making that part a phenoxy group. But what's attached to that O? Wait, in SMILES, Oc2 would mean O connected to the benzene ring (c2), but then the rest is the benzene's structure. So the O is part of the substituent on the main ring. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw this structure step by step.\n\nThe main molecule is CCOC(=O)Nc1ncc(Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C)c(N)n1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CCO: ethyl group (CH2CH3)\n- OC(=O): carbonyl oxygen, so the ethyl is attached to the carbonyl oxygen (ester group)\n- N: connected to the carbonyl\n- c1ncc(...)c(N)n1: this is a 5-membered ring (positions 1-5). The ring atoms are: position 1 is connected to N (from the carbamate), position 2 is n (nitrogen), positions 3 and 4 are c (carbon), position 5 is c connected to O (from the Oc2... part), then position 5 is connected back to position 1 via the ring closure. The substituents on the ring include O connected to the c2 benzene ring and a NH2 group (c(N) which is a carbon connected to N, which is probably NH2? Or maybe it's part of another group? Hmm.)\n\nNow, the Oc2 part: O connected to the benzene ring (c2). The benzene ring is c2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C. So the benzene ring has:\n\n- O attached at position 1 (since Oc2 starts the ring)\n- Then position 2 is c (carbon)\n- position 3 is c with I (iodine)\n- position 4 is c connected to OC (methoxy group)\n- positions 5 and 6 are c\n- position 2 (since the ring is closed with cc2C(C)C, perhaps?) Wait, SMILES can be a bit tricky. Let me parse the benzene ring part again: Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C.\n\nStarting with O connected to c2 (the benzene ring). Then, the sequence is c2 followed by cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C. So the benzene ring (c2) has the following substituents:\n\n- O at position where we start (position 1)\n- Then, moving around the ring:\n   - position 2: c (carbon)\n   - position 3: c (with I substituent)\n   - position 4: c connected to OC (methoxy)\n   - position 5: c\n   - position 6: c connected back to c2 (closing the ring)\n   - and there's a branch C(C)C attached to one of the carbons in the ring. Wait, the SMILES is cc2C(C)C. After the cc2, there's a branch C(C)C. So the benzene ring (c2) is connected to a C(C)C group (tert-butyl) at position 6 (since the ring closure is at cc2, which is positions 5 and 6?), but this is getting a bit unclear. \n\nBut the key point here is: in the benzene ring substituents, there is a methoxy group (OC), which is -OCH3. So that's not ethoxy. The other oxygen is the one attached to the benzene ring (Oc2...), which is a phenoxy group if it's part of another structure, but in this case, it's part of the larger molecule. \n\nSo the main question is: are there any ethoxy (-OCH2CH3) groups in the input molecule? The fragment is -OEt, which is ethoxy. Let's check all oxygen atoms in the input SMILES:\n\n1. The first O is in CCOC(=O)... which is part of the ester group (O connected to ethyl and carbonyl). So that's an ester O, not an ethoxy.\n2. The next O is in the carbamate group (=O), which is a carbonyl.\n3. Then there's the O in Oc2 (attached to the benzene ring). What's attached to that O? The SMILES is Oc2cc..., which means O is directly attached to the benzene ring. So that O is part of a phenoxy group (if the benzene were a separate fragment), but here it's part of the larger molecule. So that O is connected to the benzene ring, not to an ethyl group.\n4. The next O is in c(OC), which is a methoxy group (-OCH3).\n5. Any other O's? Let's see: the main chain after the carbamate is Nc1ncc(...), which includes O in the Oc2 part. \n\nLooking again, the only alkoxy groups are the methoxy (-OCH3) in the benzene ring substituent. The ethyl group (CCO) is part of an ester, not an ethoxy. So where else could there be an ethoxy?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look for any occurrence of O connected to CH2CH3. The ethyl group is present in the ester (CCO-), but that's connected via the ester oxygen (O-C(=O)), which is not an ethoxy. Ethoxy would be O-CH2CH3. So in the input molecule, is there any O connected directly to a CH2CH3 group?\n\nLooking at the SMILES:\n\n- The ester part is CCOC(=O)... so O is connected to C (from the carbonyl) and to the ethyl group (CC). So the structure is O-C(=O), with the ethyl attached to the oxygen. That's an ester group, which is indeed O-linked to ethyl, but in the context of an ester. The question is whether the fragment -OEt (ethoxy) is present as a substituent. \n\nIn the context of the problem, the fragment is given as -OEt, which is ethoxy. So the task is to count how many times the ethoxy group appears as a substituent in the molecule. \n\nIn the input molecule, the only O connected to ethyl is in the ester group (CCOC(=O)...). So is that considered an ethoxy group? Wait, ethoxy is -O-CH2CH3. The ester group has the structure R-O-C(=O)-R', which includes an oxygen connected to an ethyl group (in this case). But in the ester functional group, the oxygen is part of the carbonyl group. So in that case, the ethyl is attached to the oxygen, but the oxygen is also double-bonded to the carbonyl carbon. \n\nSo, is the ethyl-O in the ester considered an ethoxy group? The fragment definition here is -OEt, which is -O-CH2CH3. The ester's oxygen is connected to ethyl but also to the carbonyl. So the question is: does the fragment match any occurrence of -O-CH2CH3, regardless of the neighboring groups? Or does it only count if it's a free alkoxy group (i.e., not part of an ester or other functional group)?\n\nThis is a critical point. If the fragment is defined as any occurrence of -O-CH2CH3, then the ester's ethyl-O would count. But if the fragment is looking for alkoxy groups (substituents attached via oxygen to a parent structure), then the ester's ethyl-O is part of the ester functional group and not a simple alkoxy substituent.\n\nThe problem statement says \"Fragment name: ethoxy\". Ethoxy as a substituent is indeed -OCH2CH3. However, in the context of an ester, like ethyl ester, the structure is R-O-C(=O)-R', which includes the ethoxy group as part of the ester. So, depending on the context, the ethoxy might be considered present here.\n\nBut wait, in the ester group, the oxygen is connected to both the ethyl group and the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is O-C(=O), with the ethyl attached to the oxygen. So the ethyl-O is part of the ester, but it's still an ethoxy group attached to the carbonyl. Therefore, in this case, the ester does contain an ethoxy group (-OEt) as part of its structure.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in the context of an ester, the ethoxy is part of the ester functional group and not a separate substituent. But according to the SMILES definition, the fragment is -OEt, which is simply -O-CH2CH3. So if the molecule contains that exact group, regardless of neighboring atoms, it should count.\n\nSo in the input molecule, the ester part is CCOC(=O)... which is ethyl-O-C(=O)-... So the O is connected to ethyl (CH2CH3) and to the carbonyl. Therefore, this O is part of an ethoxy group attached to the carbonyl. So, this would count as one occurrence of -OEt.\n\nBut wait, the fragment SMILES is given as \"-OEt\". The hyphen indicates that it's a substituent attached to something else. So the fragment is looking for instances where -OEt is attached to the rest of the molecule. In the ester group, the O is attached to both the ethyl and the carbonyl. So in terms of connectivity, the O is bonded to the ethyl and to the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, the ethyl-O- is indeed present as a substituent on the carbonyl carbon. So this would be one ethoxy group.\n\nAdditionally, are there any other ethoxy groups in the molecule? Let's check the rest of the SMILES. The other oxygen atoms are part of the carbamate (O in the carbonyl), the phenoxy group (O attached to benzene), and the methoxy group (OCH3). The methoxy is OCH3, not OCH2CH3. The phenoxy is O attached to benzene, not to ethyl. So the only occurrence of OCH2CH3 is in the ester group.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.\n\nBut wait, the user provided Fragment SMILES as \"-OEt\". In SMILES notation, the hyphen represents a single bond to the rest of the molecule. So the fragment is -O-CH2CH3. In the input molecule, the ester group has the structure O-C(=O)-, where the O is connected to ethyl. So the ethyl-O is connected to the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, the O is bonded to ethyl and to the carbonyl carbon. Hence, the ethyl-O- is present as a substituent on the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, this would match the fragment -OEt, because the fragment is looking for OEt as a substituent, regardless of what it's attached to. \n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.",
