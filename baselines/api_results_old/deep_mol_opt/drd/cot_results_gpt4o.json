            "Structural Analysis of Source Molecule": "The source molecule contains a trifluoromethyl group attached to a nitrogen in a morpholine ring and an acetyl group linked to a benzyl moiety. It also includes a benzoxazole ring that is substituted with a trifluoromethyl group on a pyridinyl ring.",
            "Property Analysis": "The molecule targets the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), important for neurological processes like behavior and mood. Its efficacy can be influenced by its binding affinity, overall hydrophobic interactions, and electronic distribution.",
            "Limitation in Source Molecule for Property": "The trifluoromethyl group increases lipophilicity and may restrict interactions with the DRD2 receptor due to potential sterics or electronic effects. This may impact the molecule's affinity and selectivity towards the receptor.",
            "Optimization for Source Molecule": "To optimize dopamine D2 receptor activity, consider replacing one trifluoromethyl group with a smaller, electron-donating group such as methoxy or methyl to potentially enhance receptor binding by improving electronic interaction and reducing steric hindrance.",
