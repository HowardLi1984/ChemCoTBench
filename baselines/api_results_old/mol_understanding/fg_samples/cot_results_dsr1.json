        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to count the number of side-chain hydroxyls (-O) in the given molecule. The input molecule's SMILES is CCC(CO)Oc1cc(NCc2ccccc2)c2ncn(C(C)C)c2c1, and the fragment SMILES is -O, named side-chain hydroxyls.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let me break down the SMILES. Starting from the left: CCC(CO)O... So there's a propyl chain (CCC) with a branch. The branch is (CO)O. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me draw it out mentally. The propyl group (CCC) is connected to a carbon that has two oxygen-containing groups: one is CO (which is a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH), and the other is O... Wait, the SMILES is CCC(CO)Oc1cc..., so the central carbon has three substituents: two from the CCC (so the central carbon is connected to two CH2 groups?), no, wait, the SMILES notation is CCC(CO)Oc1... So the structure is:\n\nThe main chain starts with CCC. The third C (from the left) has a branch. The branch is (CO)Oc1... So the third carbon in the CCC chain is connected to another carbon (from the CO group) and an oxygen. Let me visualize:\n\nThe third carbon (let's call it C3) is connected to:\n\n- The second carbon (C2) of the propyl chain (CCC)\n- A CO group: so C3 is connected to a CH2OH group (since CO would be -O-? Wait, no. CO in SMILES is C-O, so if it's (CO), that would be a hydroxymethyl group. So the structure here is C3 connected to a CH2OH group and an oxygen (O) that is connected to a c1... (which is an aromatic ring). So the oxygen here is part of an ether linkage: O connected to the aromatic ring (c1...).\n\nSo the molecule has a propyl chain (CCC), where the middle carbon (C3) has a hydroxymethyl group (CO, which is -CH2OH) and an ether oxygen connected to a aromatic ring system. Then the aromatic ring (c1cc...) has various substituents, including a NCc2ccccc2 group (a benzylamine group attached via NH), and a c2ncn(C(C)C)c2 group, which is a pyrimidine or similar ring with substituents.\n\nNow, the fragment in question is -O, which is a hydroxyl group (-OH) as a side chain. But wait, the fragment SMILES given is \"-O\". Wait, SMILES notation for hydroxyl is -OH. If the fragment is \"-O\", that might represent an ether oxygen, but the name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\". So perhaps the user made a mistake, or maybe the fragment is intended to be hydroxyl groups (-OH). Alternatively, maybe it's looking for oxygen atoms in specific contexts.\n\nBut the Fragment Name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\", which suggests hydroxyl groups (-OH) that are part of side chains. So we need to look for -OH groups in the molecule that are not part of the main backbone or rings.\n\nLooking back at the input molecule's SMILES: The CO group in CCC(CO)O... would be a -CH2OH group. That's one hydroxyl. Then, the O in the ether linkage (Oc1...) is part of an ether, not a hydroxyl. The rest of the molecule includes an aromatic ring with substituents. Let's check the other parts:\n\nAfter the ether oxygen (Oc1...), the aromatic ring (c1) has substitutions: a NH group connected to a benzyl (NCC6H5), and another part with a c2ncn(C(C)C)c2. The C(C)C group is an isopropyl group attached to a nitrogen in the ring. No hydroxyls there.\n\nSo the only hydroxyl group would be in the CO part: the -CH2OH. Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but the fragment SMILES is \"-O\". If that's the case, maybe the user is looking for oxygen atoms in certain positions. But the name is hydroxyls, which are -OH groups. So perhaps there's a discrepancy. If the fragment is \"-O\", then ether oxygens would count, but that's not hydroxyls. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the hydroxyl oxygen. But the correct SMILES for hydroxyl is -OH. So maybe the user made a typo, but based on the name, it's hydroxyls.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to count the number of -OH groups in the molecule. Looking at the SMILES, the only -OH is in the CO group, which is -CH2OH. So count is 1.",

The molecule given is COc1cccc(Cl)c1-c1ccc(COC2COc3nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the SMILES of the input molecule. Starting from the left: COc... That's a methoxy group (OCH3), so the oxygen there is part of a methoxy, not a hydroxyl. Then there's Cl attached to a benzene ring. The main chain connects two benzene rings via a single bond. The right benzene ring has a substituent: COC2COc3... Let's break that down.\n\nLooking at COC2COc3... The COC part is a chain. The C2 indicates a ring. So maybe it's a cyclic ether or something. Let's write out the structure. The part after the first COC is C2COc3. So the oxygen in COC is part of an ether (O connected to two carbons). Then there's another O in COc3, which is another methoxy group. Then the c3 is part of a pyridine or similar ring with nitro groups. Wait, the SMILES continues: nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2. So the ring has a nitro group (N+O2-) attached. The oxygen here is part of the nitro group, not a hydroxyl.\n\nLooking for hydroxyls (-OH). The fragment SMILES is \"-O\", but in SMILES notation, hydroxyl is -O-H, right? The fragment name is side-chain hydroxyls. So maybe the oxygen is part of an alcohol group. But in the input molecule, are there any -OH groups?\n\nLooking again at the input molecule's SMILES: COc... which is OCH3 (methoxy, not hydroxyl). Then the substituent on the right benzene ring: COC2COc3... The COC part here is C-O-C, so another ether. Then there's COc3, which is another methoxy. The nitro group has [O-] and O in the nitro, but those are part of the nitro group, not hydroxyls. The only possible hydroxyl might be in the COC2COc3 part. Wait, let's parse that again. The substituent is COC2COc3... Breaking it down:\n\nCOC2COc3:\n\n- C (connected to O)\n- O (connected to C and another C, which is part of ring 2)\n- C2 (ring 2 starts here)\n- C (part of ring 2) connected to O\n- O connected to c3 (another ring, ring 3)\n\nSo the structure here is a cyclic ether (like a dioxane ring? Or maybe a five-membered ring). Wait, the exact structure might be a bit tricky, but the key point is looking for -OH groups. The fragment is \"-O\", but in SMILES, hydroxyls are -O-. Wait, no. A hydroxyl group is -OH. So if the fragment is just \"-O\", maybe it's looking for oxygen atoms in a certain context. But the fragment name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\", which implies -OH groups attached to the main chain.\n\nBut in the given molecule, are there any -OH groups? Let's check all oxygen atoms:\n\n1. The first O in COc: methoxy (OCH3) \u2013 not hydroxyl.\n2. The O in COC (from COC2COc3): part of an ether (O connected to two carbons) \u2013 not hydroxyl.\n3. The O in COc3: another methoxy group (OCH3) \u2013 not hydroxyl.\n4. The nitro group has two O atoms: part of nitro, not hydroxyl.\n5. The [O-] in the nitro group: that's an oxygen with a negative charge, part of the nitro group.\n\nWait, maybe there's a hydroxyl somewhere else. Let's check the entire structure again. The input molecule is:\n\nCOc1cccc(Cl)c1-c1ccc(COC2COc3nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2)cc1\n\nBreaking it into parts:\n\n- The left benzene ring: COc1cccc(Cl)c1. Substituents are OCH3 and Cl.\n- The middle is a single bond connecting to another benzene ring: -c1ccc(...)cc1.\n- The substituent on the right benzene ring is: COC2COc3nc([N+](=O)[O-])cn3C2.\n\nLooking at the substituent on the right benzene ring:\n\nStart with COC: that's -C-O-C- (maybe a chain). Then C2 starts a ring. So the structure here is a ring (probably 5- or 6-membered) where one of the atoms is O. Let's imagine the ring: C2 is connected to O, then another C, etc. The exact structure might be a dioxolane or similar. But the key is whether there's an -OH group.\n\nWait, in the substituent part: COC2COc3... So after the first COC, the next part is C2COc3. So the ring (C2) includes a C connected to O, which is part of the CO group. Wait, maybe the ring is O-C-C-O? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ring is C-O-C. But regardless, in the substituent, the O atoms are part of ethers (C-O-C) or methoxy groups (OCH3). There's also the nitro group's O atoms. No hydroxyl groups are present in the SMILES notation. Hydroxyl groups would be represented as -O-H, but in the given SMILES, all O atoms are either in methoxy, ether, nitro, or as part of the nitro's charge. So the count would be zero? But the fragment name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\". Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the substituent has a hydroxyl that's not obvious. Let's look at COC2COc3. The part after COC is C2COc3. If the ring (C2) is a three-membered ring, maybe there's an oxygen, but I think the SMILES would represent that with O in the ring. Alternatively, maybe there's a hydroxyl attached to a carbon in the side chain. Wait, the substituent is COC2COc3... Let's parse it step by step.\n\nThe substituent starts with C connected to O (from COC). Then C2 is the start of a ring. The ring atoms are C, O, etc. So perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an oxygen? For example, if the ring is C-C-O-C-C-C, but that's a guess. Alternatively, the ring might be a five-membered ring with an oxygen. Let's try to draw it mentally.\n\nThe substituent is COC2COc3. So:\n\n- The first C is connected to O (from COC).\n- Then C2 starts the ring. The next part is C O c3. So the ring (C2) includes a C connected to O, which is connected to c3 (another ring).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent is a chain like C-O-C-(ring), where the ring includes an O. But regardless, the O in COC would be an ether (if connected to two carbons), and the O in COc3 is a methoxy. So there are no -OH groups here. Therefore, the count of side-chain hydroxyls is zero.",

The input molecule is COc1ccc(OCC(=O)Nc2ccc3c(c2)nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2)n3C)cc1, and the fragment is =O, which refers to aldehydes or ketones.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES of the input molecule. Let me break it down. The molecule has several parts. Starting with COc1ccc(...)cc1, which is a methoxy-substituted benzene ring. The oxygen in the methoxy group (O) is part of an ether, not a ketone or aldehyde, so that's not our fragment.\n\nLooking at OCC(=O)Nc2ccc3c(c2)... There's a chain here: O connected to C connected to C(=O). The =O here is a carbonyl group. Since it's attached to a carbon that's connected to another carbon (C-C(=O)), this is a ketone group. So that's one instance of the fragment.\n\nNext, there's Nc2ccc3c(c2)nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2)n3C. Following the chain from the nitrogen: CCNC(=O). The C(=O) here is another carbonyl. The carbon adjacent is connected to a nitrogen (from the CCN group). This setup suggests an amide group, but wait, the fragment is looking for aldehydes or ketones. In amides, the carbonyl is part of the amide functional group (N-C=O), but the question is whether that counts as a ketone. Wait, aldehydes have the carbonyl at the end (RCHO), ketones are RCOR. In the amide, the carbonyl is adjacent to the nitrogen, so that's an amide, not a ketone. However, the fragment SMILES is simply =O, which would match any carbonyl group. But the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\". So maybe the user is specifically looking for carbonyl groups in side chains that are aldehydes or ketones, excluding those in amides or esters.\n\nWait, the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\". So aldehydes (RCHO) and ketones (RCOR) in the side chains. The SMILES given is =O, which is any carbonyl. But the name specifies aldehydes or ketones, so we have to distinguish those from other carbonyl groups like amides, esters, etc.\n\nSo in the input molecule, let's look for all =O groups and determine if they are part of aldehydes or ketones.\n\nLooking at the SMILES again:\n\nFirst part: OCC(=O)N... The C(=O) here is part of an ester group? Let's see: OCC(=O)N. The structure is O-C-C(=O)-N. So that's an ester if the O is connected to another carbon, but here it's O connected to C-C(=O)-N. Wait, maybe that's a carbamate? O-C-C(=O)-N would be a carbamate group. So the carbonyl here is part of a carbamate, which is an ester of carbamic acid. In that case, the carbonyl is part of an ester group, not a ketone or aldehyde. So that might not count.\n\nNext part: CCNC(=O)c2ccco2. The C(=O) here is part of a urea group? Let's see: CCN-C(=O)-... Wait, the structure is C-C-N-C(=O)-..., which is an amide. The carbonyl here is part of an amide (N-C=O). So that's an amide group. So the carbonyl here is part of an amide, not a ketone or aldehyde. So that wouldn't count either.\n\nWait, but the fragment SMILES is just =O. However, the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\". So the user is probably looking for carbonyl groups that are in aldehydes or ketones, not in other functional groups like amides, esters, etc.\n\nSo, in the input molecule, how many aldehydes or ketones are there?\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe molecule is COc1ccc(OCC(=O)Nc2ccc3c(c2)nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2)n3C)cc1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main benzene ring has a methoxy group (COc1...), which is an ether, not relevant here.\n\n- The substituent on the benzene is OCC(=O)N... So the oxygen is connected to a CH2 group, then a carbonyl (C=O), then an NH group connected to another benzene ring. The C=O here is part of a carbonyl in a carbamate or ester-like structure. Since the O is part of an ether (from the benzene's oxygen), the structure O-C-C(=O)-N is a carbamate. Therefore, the carbonyl here is part of a carbamate group, which is an ester-type functional group, not a ketone. So this C=O doesn't count.\n\nNext part: CCNC(=O)c2ccco2. This is part of the side chain. The structure is C-C-N-C(=O)-c2ccco2. The C=O here is attached to an NH group (amide), so this is an amide. Therefore, the C=O is part of an amide, not a ketone or aldehyde. So this also doesn't count.\n\nWait, are there any other C=O groups in the molecule? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the entire SMILES:\n\nCOc1ccc(OCC(=O)Nc2ccc3c(c2)nc(CCNC(=O)c2ccco2)n3C)cc1\n\nThe two C(=O) groups are:\n\n1. OCC(=O)Nc2...\n2. CCNC(=O)c2ccco2\n\nAre there any others? I don't see any. Both of these are in amide or carbamate groups. Therefore, there are no aldehydes (CHO) or ketones (RCOR) in the molecule. The carbonyl groups are part of other functional groups.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check again.\n\nThe first C(=O) is in OCC(=O)N. The oxygen before the C is part of the benzene ring's substituent. So O-C-C(=O)-N. The nitrogen is part of an aniline group (Nc2...). So that would be a structure where the carbonyl is connected to an oxygen and a nitrogen. That's a carbamate group (O-C(=O)-N), which is an ester of carbamic acid. So the carbonyl here is part of an ester, not a ketone.\n\nThe second C(=O) is in CCNC(=O)c2ccco2. The structure is C-C-N-C(=O)-..., which is an amide. So the carbonyl is part of an amide.\n\nTherefore, there are no ketones or aldehydes in this molecule. The carbonyl groups are part of other functional groups. Therefore, the count should be 0.\n\nWait, but the fragment SMILES is =O, which would match any carbonyl group. However, the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\", so perhaps the user wants to count all carbonyl groups that are part of aldehydes or ketones. If that's the case, then the count would be the number of ketones and aldehydes, not other carbonyls.\n\nIn this molecule, there are two carbonyl groups, but both are in amides or carbamates. Therefore, the count is 0.",

The user wants to know how many times the fragment SMILES \"=O\" (which represents aldehydes or ketones) appears in the input molecule.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's SMILES: CCN1CCN(C2=C(NC(=O)c3ccccc3)C(=O)c3ccccc3C2=O)CC1. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, the molecule has a central ring or cyclic structure. The SMILES notation can be a bit tricky, but let's look for the =O groups. Each occurrence of \"=O\" is a carbonyl group, which is either a ketone or an aldehyde. Since aldehydes have the structure RCHO and ketones are RCOR', here the \"=O\" would be part of either.\n\nNow, let's count the number of \"=O\" in the SMILES. Scanning through the input:\n\n1. There's NC(=O)c3ccccc3: here, the (=O) is attached to a carbon connected to an amine (N). That's a carbonyl group, likely an amide, but the fragment is just looking for =O, regardless of context. So this counts as one.\n\n2. Then there's C(=O)c3ccccc3: another (=O) attached to a carbon. This is part of another carbonyl group. That's the second one.\n\n3. Then C2=O: this is another carbonyl group. That's the third.\n\nSo in total, three instances of =O. The fragment name mentions aldehydes or ketones. The first two =O groups are in amide and ketone contexts, but the fragment SMILES is just =O, so all three would be counted. Wait, but aldehydes have the structure RCHO. Are any of these aldehydes?\n\nLooking again: the =O in the input molecule. The first two are in NC(=O)... and C(=O)... which are amide and ketone groups. The third is C2=O, which is part of a ring? Let me visualize the structure. The C2 is connected to a benzene ring (c3ccccc3) and another group. If it's C2=O, that would form a ketone if there are two R groups attached, or an aldehyde if one is a hydrogen. But in this structure, C2 is part of a ring (probably a quinone structure), so the =O here is a ketone-like group in a cyclic structure. So all three =O groups are ketones or part of amides. However, the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\". Amides have carbonyl groups but are not aldehydes or ketones. So perhaps the count should exclude the amide carbonyl.\n\nWait, the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\". So the user is interested in carbonyl groups that are aldehydes (RCHO) or ketones (RCOR') in the side chains, not in amides or other functional groups. So need to distinguish which =O groups are part of aldehydes/ketones versus amides or esters, etc.\n\nLooking back at the input molecule:\n\n- The first =O is in NC(=O)c3ccccc3. That's an amide group (N-C(=O)-Ar), so the =O here is part of an amide, not a ketone or aldehyde. So this one shouldn't count.\n\n- The second =O is in C(=O)c3ccccc3. This is a carbonyl attached to a benzene ring. The structure would be Ar-C(=O)-..., which is a ketone (since the carbonyl is between two carbons). So this counts as a ketone.\n\n- The third =O is C2=O. Let's see: the C2 is connected to another benzene ring (c3ccccc3) and possibly part of a ring structure. If C2 is part of a ring, then the =O would be part of a cyclic ketone. For example, in a quinone structure, which has two ketone groups in a ring. So that would count as ketones.\n\nSo in this case, the second and third =O groups are ketones, so the count would be 2. The first =O is part of an amide, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct count is 2.\n\nBut wait, the input SMILES is a bit complicated. Let me parse it again carefully.\n\nThe input molecule SMILES: CCN1CCN(C2=C(NC(=O)c3ccccc3)C(=O)c3ccccc3C2=O)CC1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main structure is a piperazine ring: CCN1CCN(...)CC1. The substituent on the N is a group starting with C2=... Let's look at the substituent: C2=C(NC(=O)c3ccccc3)C(=O)c3ccccc3C2=O.\n\nWait, that substituent seems to be a cyclic structure. The C2 is part of a ring. Let me try to parse that substituent:\n\nThe substituent is C2=C(...)C(=O)c3ccccc3C2=O. So the C2 is connected via a double bond (C2=C(...)), then there's a C(=O) attached, then a benzene ring (c3ccccc3), and then back to C2 with =O. So perhaps it's a bicyclic structure where C2 is part of a ring with a ketone (C=O) and another ketone (C2=O). Wait, maybe it's a structure like:\n\nC2 is double-bonded to something, then there's a carbonyl group (C(=O)), then a benzene ring, and then the C2 is also connected to another =O. That might form a ring where C2 is connected to two oxygen atoms via double bonds? That's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a bicyclic quinone-like structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. For example, if C2 is part of a ring where there are two ketone groups. Let me draw it mentally:\n\nThe substituent group starts with C2=C(...). Then there's NC(=O)c3ccccc3 (which is an amide group attached to the C2). Then C(=O)c3ccccc3 (another carbonyl attached to a benzene ring). Then C2=O. So the C2 is part of a ring where it has a double bond, an amide substituent, a ketone substituent, and another ketone (=O). This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe the substituent is a fused ring system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is a structure like:\n\nC2=C(NC(=O)Ph)-C(=O)Ph-C(=O)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Regardless, focusing on the =O groups:\n\n1. NC(=O)c3ccccc3: amide carbonyl. Not a ketone or aldehyde.\n\n2. C(=O)c3ccccc3: ketone carbonyl. Counts as a ketone.\n\n3. C2=O: if this is part of a ring, like a quinone, then it's a ketone in a cyclic structure. Quinones have ketone groups, so this would count.\n\nTherefore, the total count should be 2. The first =O is in an amide, the next two are ketones. So the answer is 2.",

The fragment is -C(=O)N-, which in the molecule would be the part where the carbonyl is connected to a nitrogen. Let me check the SMILES again: CC(=O)Nc2ccc(F)cc2. The N here is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and then to a benzene ring with fluorine substituents (c2ccc(F)cc2). So the N in the amide is part of a secondary amide because it's connected to two carbons: one from the carbonyl (C(=O)) and one from the benzene ring (c2...). \n\nNow, the task is to count how many times the fragment -C(=O)N- appears in the molecule. The fragment is the amide group. In the input molecule, the group is present as CC(=O)N. Since the SMILES is written as CC(=O)Nc2..., the N is connected to the carbonyl and then to the benzene ring. This indicates a single amide group. The rest of the molecule has other parts like the methylthio group, the other benzene rings, but no other instances of the -C(=O)N- fragment. \n\nSo, the count should be 1. I need to make sure there's no other occurrence. Let me scan the entire SMILES again. The main chain is CSc1c(...)n(...). The part in the first ring is CC(=O)Nc2..., which is the amide. The rest of the substituents are the n(Cc2ccccc2), which is a nitrogen attached to a benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2), but that's an amine, not an amide. There's also the fluorine-substituted benzene. No other carbonyl groups connected to a nitrogen. So only one instance of the fragment.",

The user wants me to count how many times the fragment \"-C(=O)N\" (which is an amide group) appears in the input molecule's structure.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's SMILES: COc1cc2nc(N3CCN(C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4)CC3)nc(N)c2cc1OC. Let me break this down. The molecule has a central aromatic ring (the 'c1cc...cc1' part), with various substituents. There are two methoxy groups (OC) attached to the benzene ring. Then there's a more complex side chain involving a nitrogen atom connected to a cyclohexane ring (the N3CCN... part). \n\nLooking at the fragment SMILES: -C(=O)N. This represents an amide group where the carbonyl (C=O) is connected to a nitrogen. The hyphen at the start indicates that the fragment is part of a larger structure; the amide is connected to another atom on the left side (the carbon in the carbonyl is attached to something else). So I need to look for instances where a carbonyl group is bonded to a nitrogen in the molecule.\n\nNow, examining the input molecule's structure, I see \"C(=O)\" in the substituent part: specifically, in \"C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4\". Wait, that part is part of the group attached to the nitrogen in the N3CCN(...)CC3 ring. The exact sequence here is N(C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4). Let me parse that. The nitrogen has a substituent which is a carbonyl group (C=O), followed by a carbon attached to fluorine (C(F)), then a double bond (C=C) connected to another benzene ring (c4ccccc4). \n\nSo in that part, there's a C(=O) connected to the nitrogen. The fragment is -C(=O)N, meaning the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl carbon. In the molecule, the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl carbon here: N(C(=O)...). So that's one occurrence. \n\nAre there any other C(=O)N groups in the molecule? Let's check the rest. The SMILES string is COc1cc2nc(N3CCN(C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4)CC3)nc(N)c2cc1OC. The other parts include another nc(N) which is a nitrile or amine group, but not an amide. The main substituents are methoxy groups, the cyclohexane ring with the amide group, and another amine group. \n\nSo I think there's only one occurrence of the -C(=O)N fragment. Wait, the fragment is written as -C(=O)N, which implies that the carbonyl is connected to another atom (the hyphen on the left). So in the molecule, the C(=O) is attached to the N in the N(C(=O)...) group. That's one instance. Any others? Let me check again. The entire structure doesn't have another carbonyl group connected directly to a nitrogen. The other nitrogens are in the aromatic rings (nc...) or as NH groups (nc(N)), which are amines or part of the ring structure, not amides. \n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.",

The fragment SMILES given is -OMe, which corresponds to a methoxy group, OCH3.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let's break down the SMILES. Starting from the left: C-O-C-C-N-C1-C-C-C... Wait, the beginning is COCCNC... So the first part is maybe a chain like OCH2CH2N... Wait, SMILES notation can sometimes be tricky.

Then an N, so maybe a chain like OCH2CH2N... Then there's a cyclohexane ring (C1CCC...CC1). The rest is a more complex structure with aromatic rings and substituents.\n\nLooking for methoxy groups, which are -OCH3. In SMILES, methoxy is typically written as OMe or O-C-CH3. The fragment here is -OMe, which in SMILES would be OC (if it's O connected to a methyl group). Wait, but the SMILES for methoxy is O-C.

Hmm, maybe I need to check how the fragment is represented.\n\nWait, the fragment is named methoxy, which is -OCH3. So in SMILES, that would be O-C. But in the input molecule, any occurrence of O connected to a CH3 group would count as a methoxy fragment. Let's look for all O atoms that are connected to a methyl group.\n\nLooking at the input SMILES: starting with COC. The first part is C-O-C. The first O is attached to a C (the first C), which is part of a chain. Let's see: the first three atoms are C-O-C. The first C is the methyl group (since it's connected to O), so that's a methoxy group (OCH3). Then the next part is C connected to another C, then N, etc. So that's one methoxy group.\n\nIs there another O connected to a methyl group elsewhere in the molecule? Let's check the rest. After the cyclohexane ring (C1CCC...CC1), there's an N connected to a benzene ring (c2cc...cn2). Then there's a substituent on the benzene ring: -c3nc(...)ccc3Cl. The Cl is attached to the benzene ring. Then there's another substituent: -c3nc(NCC4CCOCC4)ccc3Cl. Wait, in that part, there's a NCC4CCOCC4. Let's look at that. The CCOCC part is a ring? Wait, C4CCOCC4 would form a ring. Let me parse that: C4 connected to C-C-O-C-C, making a 6-membered ring? Wait, the SMILES is NCC4CCOCC4. So the 4 is a ring closure. So the group is N-C-C4-C-C-O-C-C4. That would form a morpholine ring (O in a six-membered ring with two carbons on each side). So that part is a morpholine substituent. The oxygen there is part of the ring, not a methoxy group. So no methoxy there.\n\nLooking further in the SMILES, any other O atoms? The input SMILES is COCCNC1CCC(Nc2cc(-c3nc(NCC4CCOCC4)ccc3Cl)c(Cl)cn2)CC1. The O's are in the initial COC, then in the morpholine ring (CCOCC4), and that's it. So the only methoxy group is the first one, COC. So the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but wait. The first part is COCCNC... The first three atoms are C-O-C. So the O is connected to a CH3 (the first C) and then another C. So that's OCH2CH2... Wait, no, the first C is a methyl group attached to O. Wait, SMILES is read as atoms in sequence. So COC would be C-O-C. The first C is a methyl group (since it's connected to O), so OCH3, then the next C is connected to that O. So that's a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a CH2 group? Wait, no. Let me clarify: The SMILES starts with C-O-C. The first C is connected to O, and since it's a single bond, the first C would have three other bonds. Assuming it's a methyl group (CH3), then O is connected to that CH3 and then to another C. So the first part is CH3-O-CH2... So the methoxy group is the OCH3 here. Then the next C is connected to the O and to another C and maybe the N. So that's one methoxy group. Are there any others? The morpholine ring has an O, but that's part of a six-membered ring (O connected to two CH2 groups), so that's not a methoxy. Any other O atoms? Let me check again. The input SMILES: COCCNC1CCC(Nc2cc(-c3nc(NCC4CCOCC4)ccc3Cl)c(Cl)cn2)CC1. The O's are in COCC and in CCOCC4. So only the first O is part of a methoxy group. Therefore, the count is 1.",

The input molecule's SMILES is NC(=O)c1cccc2c(NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3)ncnc12.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a primary amine is. A primary amine has a nitrogen atom connected to exactly one carbon atom. So, in SMILES notation, that would be a nitrogen with only one adjacent carbon. However, I should also consider the context\u2014like if the nitrogen is part of an aromatic ring or other structures where it might have different bonding.\n\nLooking at the SMILES string: NC(=O)c1cccc2c(NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3)ncnc12.\n\nLet's break it down step by step. Starting from the beginning:\n\n1. The first part is \"N\", which is NC(=O)... So that's an amino group attached to a carbonyl. The nitrogen here is connected to the carbonyl carbon (C=O). Since this nitrogen is only bonded to one carbon (the carbonyl carbon), that's a primary amine. But wait, wait\u2014if the nitrogen is part of an amide group, does that affect its classification? In an amide, the nitrogen is usually connected to two carbons (the carbonyl and another R group), but in this case, the SMILES is NC(=O)... which suggests the nitrogen is attached directly to the carbonyl. So that would be NH2-C(=O)-... which is a primary amide. So the nitrogen here has two substituents: one from the carbonyl and another hydrogen. Wait, primary amines are -NH2 groups. But in the amide, the nitrogen is bonded to the carbonyl and has two Hs? Or maybe one H? Let me think. In an amide, the structure is RCONHR', where R and R' could be hydrogens or other groups. If it's NC(=O), then the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl and has two hydrogens. So that would be a primary amine, but in the context of an amide. Wait, but amides are not considered primary amines because the lone pair on the nitrogen is delocalized into the carbonyl. However, the question is about the fragment being \"-N\" as primary amines. Maybe the fragment SMILES is just \"-N\" which might represent a primary amine group. But perhaps I need to check exactly how the fragment is defined.\n\nThe fragment SMILES given is \"-N\". Wait, but SMILES notation usually uses explicit hydrogens. A primary amine would be NH2 group. But if the fragment is written as \"-N\", maybe it's indicating a nitrogen with two hydrogens and one bond to the rest of the molecule. However, in SMILES, \"N\" can represent NH2 if it's a terminal group. For example, methylamine is CN, where the N has two Hs. So, in the input molecule, the first N is part of NC(=O)... which is an amide group. But is that a primary amine?\n\nHmm. The primary amine is when the nitrogen is attached to only one carbon and has two hydrogens. So in the amide group, the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl carbon and has two hydrogens (assuming it's NH2). But in reality, in an amide, the nitrogen is usually deprotonated because of resonance with the carbonyl. However, the question is about counting the fragment, not the actual protonation state. So structurally, if the nitrogen is bonded to one carbon and has two hydrogens, it's a primary amine.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES again:\n\n- The first part is NC(=O)... So N connected to C(=O). That N is attached to one carbon (the carbonyl C). So that would be a primary amine group. But wait, in the SMILES notation, that N would have two hydrogens. So that's one occurrence.\n\nThen, looking further: there's another part, NCC3... So that's N connected to a C (which is part of another chain). The N here is part of a NC group. Wait, the SMILES is NCc3... So the nitrogen here is connected to a carbon (C), which is then connected to another carbon (c3...). So the nitrogen in NC is attached to one carbon (the adjacent C), making it a primary amine? Wait, if the structure is -NH-CH2-..., then the NH would have two Hs, making it a primary amine. But wait, the SMILES notation here is NCc3..., which would imply that the nitrogen is bonded to a carbon (C), which is then connected to another carbon (c3, which is aromatic). So the N here is bonded to one carbon (the C in NCc3), so that's another primary amine.\n\nThen, further down, there's another N in (Nc4nccs4). The SMILES here is Nc4nccs4. The c4 indicates that it's part of an aromatic ring. So the nitrogen here is part of an aromatic ring? Wait, aromatic nitrogens can have different bonding. For example, in pyridine, the nitrogen has two lone electrons and is part of the aromatic ring. But in pyrrole, the nitrogen contributes two electrons. But in the SMILES notation, aromatic nitrogens are denoted with lowercase 'n'. So here, the 'Nc4' part: the 'N' is uppercase, meaning it's probably in a non-aromatic context. Wait, the 'c4' is part of an aromatic ring (since 'c' is lowercase), so the N connected to c4 would be part of an aromatic ring? Wait, no. The 'Nc4nccs4' part: the 'c4' is an aromatic carbon in a ring. The 'N' here is connected to that aromatic carbon. So the structure is N attached to an aromatic carbon. If the nitrogen is part of an aromatic ring, like in aniline, then it's a primary amine. But aromatic amines are still primary if the nitrogen is only attached to one carbon (the benzene ring's carbon). But in aniline, the NH2 is attached to the benzene, which is a primary amine. However, if the nitrogen is part of the aromatic ring (like in pyrrole), then it's not a primary amine. So in this case, the 'Nc4' would be an NH group attached to the aromatic ring (since 'c4' is aromatic). Wait, but SMILES notation: if it's 'Nc4', that suggests a single bond between N and the aromatic carbon. So the nitrogen here would have two hydrogens, making it a primary amine. But wait, if the nitrogen is attached to an aromatic ring (like in aniline), that's a primary amine. So in this case, the N connected to c4 (aromatic) would be a primary amine. So that's another occurrence.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. The first N in NC(=O) is a primary amine (NH2 attached to carbonyl).\n2. The N in NCc3... is a primary amine (NH2 attached to CH2...? Wait, the SMILES is NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3. So the structure is N-C-C3..., meaning the N is attached to a CH2 group (the C in NCc3 is a CH2?), so the N here would have two Hs, making it a primary amine.\n3. The N in Nc4nccs4 is attached to an aromatic ring (c4), so that's another primary amine.\n\nWait, but let's check each occurrence:\n\nLooking at the SMILES:\n\nNC(=O)c1cccc2c(NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3)ncnc12\n\nParsing the SMILES:\n\n- Start with NC(=O): that's the amide group. The N here is connected to the carbonyl C. So structure is NH2-C(=O)-...\n- Then c1cccc2...: this is an aromatic ring (benzene-like) with substituents.\n- The 2c(...)ncnc12 part: perhaps a fused ring system.\n- Then there's NCc3...: so N connected to C connected to c3 (aromatic carbon). So that's a -NH-CH2- group attached to an aromatic ring? If that's the case, the NH would have two Hs, making it a primary amine.\n- Then within c3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3: the c3 ring has a substituent Nc4... So N attached to c4 (another aromatic ring), which is part of a nccs4 ring (possibly a thiazole or similar). The N in Nc4 is attached to an aromatic carbon (c4), so that's another primary amine.\n\nAdditionally, there's another N in the ncnc12 part. The lowercase 'n' indicates an aromatic nitrogen. So those are likely part of a ring (like pyridine or similar) and wouldn't be primary amines because they're in an aromatic ring with different bonding.\n\nSo total primary amines would be:\n\n1. The first N in NC(=O)\n2. The N in NCc3...\n3. The N in Nc4...\n\nSo three primary amines.\n\nWait, but let's check the SMILES again:\n\nThe entire SMILES is NC(=O)c1cccc2c(NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3)ncnc12\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- NC(=O): amide group. N here is NH2? Or is it NH connected to the carbonyl? In SMILES, NC(=O) would be NH2-C(=O)-, assuming the N has two Hs. So that's a primary amine.\n\nThen, the main ring is c1cccc2c(...)ncnc12. The 'c1' is the first aromatic ring, connected to the carbonyl. Then at position 2 of the first ring (since it's c1cccc2...), there's a substituent: c(...) which is part of a fused ring. The 'c(...)' is connected to the second ring, which is ncnc12. Wait, the numbering here is a bit complex. The main structure might be a bicyclic system with two aromatic rings fused together.\n\nBut focusing on the substituents:\n\n- In the substituent part: NCc3cccc(Nc4nccs4)c3. This is a chain starting with N connected to C (CH2), then connected to another aromatic ring c3. The c3 ring has a substituent Nc4..., which is another aromatic ring (c4 is part of nccs4, which is a 5-membered ring with N, three Cs, and S).\n\nSo the NCc3... part: the N here is NH2 connected to a CH2 group (since it's NCc3...). So that's a primary amine.\n\nThe Nc4... part: the N is attached to the c4 aromatic ring. So that's an aromatic amine (like aniline), which is a primary amine.\n\nAdditionally, in the main structure, are there any other Ns? Let's see: the main ring has ncnc12. The lowercase 'n's are aromatic nitrogens. These are part of the ring and not primary amines.\n\nSo total count: 3 primary amines.\n\nWait, but the SMILES for the fragment is \"-N\". Does that mean any primary amine group? Or is there a specific way to count based on the SMILES? The fragment SMILES is \"-N\", which could represent a terminal NH2 group. But in the molecule, some of these Ns might be part of larger groups. For example, the NC(=O) is a primary amide, which is a type of primary amine. The NCc3... is a primary amine (NH2-CH2-...). The Nc4... is an aniline-type NH attached to an aromatic ring. So all three are primary amines.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 3.",

A primary amine has an amino group (-NH2) where the nitrogen is attached to only one carbon atom. But the SMILES given here is \"-N\", which might be a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe the fragment is just an amine group, but specifically primary. So I should look for -NH2 groups in the molecule.\n\nLooking at the SMILES of the input molecule, let's parse it. Breaking it down: the main structure seems to be a benzene ring (c1cc...c1) with various substituents. \n\nStarting from the beginning: Cc1cc(C#N)cc(...)c1. The first part is a methyl group (C) attached to the benzene ring. Then there's a cyano group (C#N) attached to the ring. \n\nNext part: C(=O)c2c(...) which is a ketone (C=O) connected to another ring. The ring denoted by c2...n2 has substituents: C(C)C (an isopropyl group), another ketone (c(=O)), [nH] (a NH group), another ketone (c(=O)), and a nitrogen (n2). Then there's a Cc2cc... which connects another benzene ring. \n\nIn this second ring (cc(N)nc(F)c2F), I see an N in the substituent: cc(N) means there's an amino group attached to the ring. Let's check that part: the substituent here is N, which in SMILES would be -NH2 if it's a primary amine. But in SMILES notation, 'N' without any bonds specified usually represents NH2 when it's a terminal group. So the 'N' here would be a primary amine group. \n\nLooking at the SMILES string, the part 'cc(N)nc(F)c2F' \u2013 the N here is connected to the benzene ring. Since it's written as N without any other bonds, it's likely -NH2. Therefore, this is a primary amine. \n\nAre there any other NH2 groups in the molecule? Let's check the rest. The other nitrogen-containing groups are C#N (a nitrile, not an amine), [nH] (which is part of a ring, probably an aromatic NH like in a pyrrole or similar, so not a primary amine), and the n in the rings which are part of aromatic structures (like pyridine or similar), which are not amines. \n\nSo the only primary amine group is the one in 'cc(N)nc(F)c2F'.

The ethoxy group is -OCH2CH3, which in SMILES is O-C-C, right? So looking for any oxygen connected to an ethyl group (CH2CH3).\n\nLooking at the input molecule: The SMILES starts with CCOC(=O)... That part is ethyl (CC) attached to an oxygen (O), which is then connected to a carbonyl group (C=O). So that's an ethoxy group (OEt) attached to a carbonyl. That's one occurrence.\n\nNext, I'll check the rest of the structure. There's another part: -c3ccccc3OC. Here, the OC is attached to a benzene ring. The OC here is O connected to a CH3? Wait, OC would be O-C. But in the fragment, it's -OEt, which is O-C-C. So if there's an O-C without another C, that's a methoxy (OMe), not ethoxy (OEt). So that OC at the end of the benzene ring (c3ccccc3OC) would be methoxy, not ethoxy. So that's not a match.\n\nThen there's CCCO1 at the end. That's a cyclic structure where O is part of a ring. The CCCO1 is a four-membered ring (O1 connected to three carbons and another carbon). But that's part of the cyclic structure, not an ethoxy group.\n\nSo the only ethoxy group is the first part: CCOC(=O)... So count should be 1.\n\nWait, let me check again. The fragment is -OEt, which is -O-CH2CH3. The first part of the molecule is CCOC(=O), which is ethyl (CC) attached to O, then carbonyl. So yes, that's one ethoxy group. Are there any others? Let me look through the entire SMILES again.\n\nAfter the first part, there's C1(...) which is a cyclic ester or something. The substituents on that ring might have other groups. Let me parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nThe main chain is CCOC(=O)C1(...)CCCO1. The C1 is part of a ring, with CCCO1 making a four-membered ring (O1 is the oxygen in the ring).

That substituent is a benzene ring (c3ccccc3) connected via a single bond to OC. So that's a methoxy group (OC is O-C, but where's the other C? Wait, OC at the end of the benzene would be O-C, but since it's written as -c3ccccc3OC, maybe that's O connected to a CH3? Or maybe it's O-C without another carbon, which would be a hydroxyl? No, because hydroxyl is -OH. Wait, the SMILES syntax can be a bit tricky. Let me think: the part is -c3ccccc3OC. So after the benzene ring (c3ccccc3), there's a single bond to O, which is connected to C. But C without any other atoms would be a methyl group. Wait, no, the O is connected to a C, which is then what? If it's OC, that would be O-C, but unless there are more atoms, it might be O-C with the next atom being part of another group. Wait, maybe the OC is part of another chain. Let me look again.\n\nThe full SMILES is CCOC(=O)C1(C(=O)NC(Cc2ccc(-c3ccccc3OC)cc2)C(=O)O)CCCO1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main chain starts with CCOC(=O), which is ethyl (CC) attached to O, then carbonyl. That's the first part.\n- Then comes C1(...)CCCO1, which forms a ring. The C1 is connected to several groups.\n- The substituents on C1 include another C(=O) group, which is connected to NC(...). The NC is part of an amide group.\n- The NC is connected to a C(Cc2ccc(...)cc2) group. The Cc2ccc(...)cc2 is a benzyl group (c2 is a benzene ring) with a substituent at position 4 (since it's ccc(-substituent)cc2).\n- The substituent on the benzene ring is -c3ccccc3OC. This is a benzene ring (c3ccccc3) connected via a single bond to O, which is connected to C. But wait, OC here would be O-C, but if there's no further atoms attached to that C, that's a methyl group. So the substituent is -OCH3, which is methoxy, not ethoxy. So that's a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring.\n\nSo the only ethoxy group is the initial CCO- part.

The substituents on the benzene include a C3 group. Let's see: C3(Cc4ccccc4)CCNC3. That part might be a cyclohexane or similar with substituents. The Cc4ccccc4 is a benzyl group (CH2 attached to benzene). So the C3 is part of a ring: C3(...)CCNC3. That makes a ring with three carbons? Wait, the SMILES is C3(...)CCNC3. So the ring would have 3 + 2 carbons from CC, then N, then C. Wait, maybe it's a 6-membered ring? Let me parse that again.\n\nThe part is C3(Cc4ccccc4)CCNC3. So, the C3 is the first carbon in a ring. The group attached to C3 is a benzyl (CH2-benzene). Then there's CC (two carbons), then N (nitrogen), then C (another carbon), and back to C3. So the ring would be C3 connected to C (from CC), then another C (from CC), then N, then another C, then back to C3. That makes a 5-membered ring? Let me count: C3 -> C -> C -> N -> C -> C3. Wait, no, maybe the ring is C3 connected to the next C (from CC), then another C (from CC), then N, then C, then back to C3. So that's a 5-membered ring? Or maybe I'm getting the connectivity wrong. Regardless, this part is a cyclic structure with a benzyl substituent. But does this part contain any ethoxy groups? Doesn't look like it. The substituents here are the benzyl group and the CC...N part. There's no oxygen in this part, so no ethoxy.\n\nSo the only ethoxy group is the one in the ester at the beginning: CCOC(=O).

The molecule's SMILES is COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1C(=O)OCCN1CCC(C(N)=O)CC1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES correctly. Let's break it down. Starting from the left: COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1C(=O)OCCN1CCC(C(N)=O)CC1. The COc is a methoxy group attached to a benzene ring. The ring has substituents: an amino group (N), chlorine (Cl), and then the ring connects to a carbonyl group (C(=O)O...). \n\nAfter the carbonyl (C=O), there's an OCC, which is an oxygen connected to a CH2CH2 group. Then N1CCC... which is a piperazine or similar ring. The part after that is C(N)=O, which is a carbamoyl group (amide), not an ester.\n\nSo focusing on the ester group (-COOR). The ester functional group is typically R-O-CO-O-R, but in SMILES notation, it's usually written as COOR, where the carbonyl is connected to an oxygen which is connected to an R group. \n\nLooking at the input molecule: The part after the benzene ring is C(=O)OCCN... So the carbonyl (C=O) is connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a ethyl group (CC) attached to a nitrogen. Wait, the O is connected to CC, which is part of OCCN... So the structure is C(=O)O-C-C-N... That would make the ester group here: the carbonyl oxygen is connected to an ethyl group (OCH2CH2...), but then the ethyl is connected to a nitrogen. Wait, esters are usually O connected to an alkyl or aryl group, but here the O is connected to CH2CH2N... So the R in COOR is the ethyl group attached to the nitrogen? Hmm. \n\nWait, the SMILES is C(=O)OCCN1CCC(C(N)=O)CC1. Breaking it down: C(=O)O-C-C-N... So the ester would be the O-C-C, but the C-C is part of the OCCN group. The ester group is -O-CO-O-R, but here it's C(=O)O-C-C-N. So the R here is the ethyl group (CH2CH2) connected to the nitrogen. But esters have the structure R-O-CO-R', right? So the carbonyl is adjacent to an oxygen connected to an R group. In this case, the carbonyl is at C(=O)O, which is connected to an ethyl group (OCH2CH2) which is connected to a nitrogen. So that part would be an ester group: the O is connected to the carbonyl and then to an ethyl group. The ethyl group is part of a larger structure, but the ester itself is the -O-CO-O-R part. Wait, no. Wait, esters are RCOOR', so the structure is carbonyl-O-R'. In the SMILES, after the benzene ring, we have C(=O)OCCN... So that's carbonyl-O-C-C-N. The O is connected to a CH2CH2 group, which is connected to a nitrogen. So the R' in the ester (the OR' part) is ethyl (CH2CH2), but then the ethyl is attached to a nitrogen. So does that still count as an ester? Because the ester is the O connected to an alkyl group, regardless of what's attached to the alkyl group. The key is whether the oxygen is directly connected to the carbonyl and then to an R group. So in this case, the O is part of the ester group (COO-), and the R is the ethyl group (CH2CH2N...). So that would be one ester group. \n\nIs there another ester group in the molecule? Let's check the rest. The other part is C(N)=O, which is an amide (since the carbonyl is connected to a NH2 group), so that's not an ester. The rest of the molecule includes a piperazine ring (N1CCC...), but no other carbonyl groups attached to oxygen. \n\nSo the count should be 1.

The molecule's SMILES is O=C(Nc1ccc2oc(Cc3ccccc3)nc2c1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let's break down the SMILES. The main parts are an amide group (O=C-N), connected to a benzene ring (c1ccc...). There's a substituent on the benzene ring: another ring system with an oxygen and a nitrogen, possibly a fused ring. Then there's a second benzene ring attached to the carbonyl group, which has a nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]).\n\nWait, the fragment in question is nitroso, which is -N=O. But the nitro group is different\u2014it's [N+](=O)[O-], where the nitrogen is positively charged with two oxygens attached. The nitroso group is a neutral N double-bonded to O. So I need to check if the input molecule has any nitroso groups.\n\nLooking at the input SMILES, I see that the nitro group is present as [N+](=O)[O-], which is nitro (nitro group), not nitroso. The nitroso would be just -N=O without the charge. Let me check all nitrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe molecule has a few nitrogens. The first is in the amide group (N connected to the carbonyl). Then there's an 'nc2c1' part, which is a nitrogen in a ring. Let's see: the part 'oc(Cc3ccccc3)nc2c1'\u2014so the nitrogen here is part of a ring? That might be a five-membered ring with O and N. The substituent here is Cc3ccccc3, which is a benzyl group. So that nitrogen is in a ring, bonded to a carbon that's part of the benzyl group. But is there a double bond to oxygen here? The SMILES is 'oc(...)nc2c1'. The 'o' is oxygen single-bonded, and the 'n' here would be connected to adjacent atoms. Maybe in the ring, there's a double bond. Let me draw this mentally.\n\nThe ring structure could be a fused ring. The 'c1ccc2oc(...)nc2c1' part suggests that the main benzene ring (c1ccc...) is fused to another ring (the '2' part). The 'oc' and 'nc' would be part of the second ring. So that second ring might be a five-membered ring with O, C, N, and two other carbons. If the oxygen is single-bonded and the nitrogen is part of the ring, maybe there's a double bond between N and C? Or perhaps between O and C? Not sure. Wait, the 'oc' is followed by (Cc3ccccc3), which is a benzyl substituent. So the oxygen is connected to a carbon that's part of the benzyl group. Then the 'nc2c1' part\u2014so the nitrogen is in the ring. Let me write the structure:\n\nMain benzene ring (c1ccc2...), fused to a second ring (ring2: o, c, n, etc.). The second ring would be: positions 2 (from the main benzene) connected to O, then a carbon connected to benzyl, then a nitrogen, then another carbon back to the main ring. That would make a five-membered ring: O-C(C6H5)-C-N-C? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the ring could be o-C(...)-n-C-C, forming a five-membered ring. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the key point is to look for any -N=O groups.\n\nLooking again at the entire SMILES: the only occurrence of N=O is in the nitro group, which is [N+](=O)[O-]. The nitroso group is -N=O without the charge and without the additional oxygen. So in the input molecule, there's a nitro group (which is a different functional group) but no nitroso groups. The nitroso fragment is -N=O, but in the molecule, the nitro group has the N with a double bond to O but also another O- as a negative charge. Therefore, the nitroso group isn't present here.\n\nSo the count should be zero. The fragment_structure would note that the nitroso group (-N=O) isn't present in the input molecule.

Let me parse the SMILES. The main chain seems to be a cyclohexane ring (C1CCCN...C1) with various substituents. There's an ethyl carbonate group (CCOC(=O)), and a piperidine ring (CCCCN). Attached to the nitrogen of the piperidine is a benzimidazole-like structure. Let me break that down: Cc2nc3ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc3c(=O)n2... So, there's a benzene ring (ccc...cc) with substituents.

Let me parse this structure. The molecule seems to have a bicyclic system. The first part is a benzene ring with substituents. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nLooking for the fragment =N-O. The SMILES =N-O implies a nitro group, which is [N+](=O)[O-]. Wait, oximes are typically R1R2C=N-OH. But the fragment name here is oximes, but the SMILES given is =N-O. That might be a discrepancy. Wait, oxime is usually C=N-OH, but the SMILES provided is =N-O. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake here? Or maybe it's a nitro group? Because [N+](=O)[O-] is a nitro group, not an oxime. Oxime would be like C=N-O. But the fragment name says oximes, but the SMILES is =N-O. Maybe there's confusion here. Let me check.\n\nWait, the fragment SMILES is =N-O.

The nitro group has N with two double bonds (one to O, another as part of the charge). Wait, nitro is [N+](=O)[O-]. The SMILES =N-O would be like a group where N is double-bonded to O and then connected to another O. But that's not the same as nitro. Wait, maybe the fragment is supposed to be a nitro group, but the user called it oximes by mistake. Or perhaps the fragment is a different structure.\n\nWait, oximes are R2C=N-OH. The SMILES for an oxime group would be C=N-O. But the given fragment is =N-O. So maybe the user is referring to the nitro group but named it incorrectly as oximes. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the fragment SMILES. Let's assume the user provided the correct SMILES and name. But the SMILES =N-O doesn't correspond to an oxime. An oxime would have a hydroxyl group attached to the N. For example, acetoxime would be CC(=N-O)C. So the correct SMILES for an oxime group would be C=N-O. But here, the fragment is =N-O, which would imply that the N is double-bonded to O and connected to another O. That structure doesn't correspond to an oxime. Wait, maybe the user intended nitro group but named it oximes. Let's see the input molecule has [N+](=O)[O-], which is a nitro group. So if the fragment SMILES is =N-O but named oximes, that's conflicting. But perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is written as O-N=, which would be similar to nitro.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is a nitroso group (O=N-O), but that's not common. Let me think. The input molecule has a nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]). The fragment SMILES given is =N-O. Let me compare. The nitro group in the molecule is [N+](=O)[O-]. The fragment is written as =N-O. If we ignore the charge, the nitro group has N connected to two O atoms: one double-bonded (=O) and one single-bonded ([O-]). So the structure would be O=[N+](-[O-]). But the fragment is =N-O. So if the fragment is N double-bonded to O and single-bonded to another O (without charges), then it's not the same as the nitro group. But in the molecule, the nitro group is present once. However, the fragment SMILES given doesn't exactly match the nitro group structure because of the charge and the arrangement. But maybe the user is considering the nitro group as the fragment, even though the SMILES doesn't match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment SMILES is a typo and should be [N+](=O)[O-]. But the user provided =N-O. So in this case, perhaps there's a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to look for the nitro group, but the name was written as oximes by mistake. Let me proceed. The input molecule has a nitro group in the substituent: [N+](=O)[O-]. So if we count how many times this group appears, the answer would be 1. But the fragment SMILES given is =N-O. Let me check if the nitro group's structure can be represented as =N-O. No, because the nitro group has a positive charge on N, and one O is double-bonded, another O- is single-bonded. The SMILES for nitro is [N+](=O)[O-]. So the fragment SMILES =N-O would not match that. Therefore, in the input molecule, there are no instances of the fragment =N-O as provided. But wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the SMILES. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is part of a larger structure. Let me check the input molecule again.\n\nLooking at the input SMILES: Cc1c(Cc2cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c2)c(=O)oc2cc(OC(=O)N(C)C)ccc12. Breaking it down:\n\n- The main ring is a benzene ring (positions 1 and 2 are connected via the oxygen from the ester group). Let me try to draw it:\n\nThe core structure is a bicyclic system, possibly a benzofuran or similar. The substituents include a methyl group (Cc1c...), a side chain with another benzene ring (Cc2cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c2), an ester group (c(=O)o...), and another substituent with an ether (OC(=O)N(C)C).\n\nIn the part Cc2cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c2, that's a benzene ring (c2cccc...c2) with a substituent [N+](=O)[O-] (nitro group) and a methyl group (from the C in Cc2...). So that's one nitro group in the molecule.\n\nThe other parts of the molecule include an ester (c(=O)o) and a carbamate group (OC(=O)N(C)C). The carbamate has an O-C(=O)-N(C)C structure.\n\nSo the nitro group is present once. If the fragment is supposed to be nitro, then count is 1. But the fragment name is oximes, which is conflicting. However, based on the provided fragment SMILES =N-O, which doesn't correspond to oxime but maybe a nitroso group or something else, but in the molecule, there's a nitro group. Since the SMILES given doesn't match the nitro group's structure (due to charges and connectivity), the count would be zero. But that seems unlikely. Maybe the user intended the nitro group and made a mistake in the fragment name or SMILES. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is written without considering charges, so =N-O would match the nitro group's structure if charges are ignored. But in SMILES notation, charges are important. The nitro group is [N+](=O)[O-], which is different from =N-O. Therefore, there are no instances of the fragment =N-O in the molecule. But the molecule does have a nitro group once. However, since the fragment SMILES doesn't match, the count would be zero. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write the nitro group's SMILES but wrote it incorrectly. But according to the given information, the fragment is =N-O, which doesn't exist in the molecule. Hence, the count is zero.",

Breaking it down, there's a central cyclohexene ring (the C1...C1 part) with various substituents. On the ring, there's a methoxy group (OCH3), a carbonyl group (C=O), some methyl substituents (C), and then another benzene ring attached (the c1ccc(Cl)c(...)c1 part). \n\nLooking at the substituents on the benzene ring: one chlorine (Cl) and a nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]). Wait, the nitro group is O-N-O, but the fragment we're looking for is =N-O. The SMILES for the fragment is =N-O, which is an oxime group. Oximes typically have a structure like R1R2C=N-OH, but in the SMILES here, it's written as =N-O. However, the nitro group is [N+](=O)[O-], which is a nitro (NO2) group, not an oxime. \n\nNow, checking the central ring. There's a N=C(C) part. The structure around the nitrogen here is a double bond to carbon (N=C). The SMILES for the fragment is =N-O. So I need to see if there's any occurrence where a nitrogen is double-bonded to an oxygen. Wait, in the input molecule, the nitro group is [N+](=O)[O-]. Here, the nitrogen is double-bonded to one oxygen and single-bonded to another (with a positive charge). That's a nitro group, not an oxime. The oxime would have a structure like C=N-OH. \n\nLooking at the central ring again, the substituents are N=C(C). That's an imine group (C=N), but without an adjacent hydroxyl (OH) group. The fragment SMILES is =N-O, which would imply that the nitrogen is double-bonded to something (like carbon) and single-bonded to an oxygen. But in the input molecule, the nitro group's nitrogen is bonded to two oxygens, one double bond and one single (but with charges). \n\nSo, the fragment =N-O would require a nitrogen double-bonded to a carbon and single-bonded to an oxygen. The nitro group has N double-bonded to O, but the fragment is N-O, not N=O. Wait, the fragment SMILES is written as =N-O. So, that would be a structure where the nitrogen is double-bonded to something (like a carbon) and also bonded to an oxygen. For example, C=N-O-R. But in the input molecule, I don't see any such groups. The nitro group is O-N(=O)-, which is different. The only other nitrogen in the molecule is the N in the central ring, which is part of an imine (C=N-C), but there's no oxygen attached to that nitrogen. \n\nTherefore, I don't see any occurrences of the fragment =N-O in the input molecule.

The fragment we need to count is nitriles, which have the SMILES #N.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the input molecule. The SMILES notation can be broken down. Starting with N#C, that's a nitrile group (cyanide). Then there's a benzene ring (c1cc...), some other substituents like a carbonyl group (=O), and various nitrogen-containing rings or chains.\n\nThe fragment is nitriles, which are represented by the SMILES #N. A nitrile group is a carbon triple-bonded to a nitrogen, so the SMILES is C#N. Wait, the user provided #N as the fragment SMILES. Hmm, maybe that's shorthand. In SMILES notation, the nitrile group is typically written as C#N. If the fragment is given as #N, that might just be the triple bond and nitrogen, but in reality, it's the C#N group. However, the user specified the fragment SMILES as #N, so I need to check if that's correct or if it's a typo.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake here. Because in SMILES, the nitrile is C#N. If the fragment is given as #N, that's just a nitrogen with a triple bond. But in reality, the nitrile group is a carbon connected via triple bond to nitrogen. So the correct SMILES for nitrile is C#N. If the fragment is given as #N, that's just the triple bond and nitrogen atom, which might not be correct. However, the user has specified Fragment SMILES as #N, so I have to go with that.\n\nBut looking at the input molecule, the SMILES starts with N#C. Wait, that's actually written as N#C, which is the same as C#N because SMILES is directionless for triple bonds. So the nitrile group here is indeed present as N#C. So in the molecule, there's a nitrile group at the beginning: N#Cc1cc2...\n\nSo if the fragment is #N, which would correspond to the triple bond and nitrogen, but in the molecule, the nitrile is N#C, which is equivalent. However, when looking for the fragment, we need to see if the SMILES pattern #N exists in the molecule. But SMILES is about connectivity. The fragment #N would be a nitrogen with a triple bond. But in the molecule, the nitrogen is triple-bonded to carbon (C#N). So the actual group is C#N, which includes both the carbon and nitrogen. The fragment given as #N is just the nitrogen with a triple bond, but in reality, that's part of a larger group. However, maybe the user intended to count the number of nitrile groups, which are C#N, so even if the fragment SMILES is given as #N, we need to consider that the actual nitrile group is C#N. But since the user specified the fragment SMILES as #N, perhaps they are considering just the triple bond and nitrogen. But that might not be correct. Wait, SMILES syntax requires that each atom has the correct valence. A nitrogen with a triple bond would have a valence of 3, which is possible if it's part of a nitrile group (C#N). So in the SMILES string, the nitrile is represented as C#N. In the input molecule, it's written as N#C, which is the same thing. So the nitrile group is present once in the molecule.\n\nSo the input molecule has one nitrile group. Therefore, the count should be 1.

That means the sulfur is connected to two oxygen atoms (as sulfonyl), an amine group (-NH2), and another substituent. In the primary sulfonamide, the nitrogen of the amine should be directly attached to the sulfonyl group and not have any other carbon attachments (i.e., it's -NH2, not -NHR or -NR2).\n\nNow, examining the input molecule. Starting from the nitrogen (N) at the beginning: the structure is NS(=O)(=O)c1... So here, the sulfur is connected to two oxygens (as =O), the NH2 group (since the N is bonded to the S and two hydrogens?), and then a benzene ring (c1...). Wait, but the N here is bonded to S and then the benzene. Wait, the SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)c1... So the N is attached to S, which has two double-bonded O atoms. Then, the S is connected to the benzene ring (c1...). So the group here is -N-SO2-Ph. Wait, but the N is part of the sulfonamide. Let me check: the structure would be N-SO2-Ph. Since the N is attached directly to the SO2 group, and if that N has two hydrogens, then it's a primary sulfonamide. But in this case, the N is connected to the S and then the benzene. So the N here is part of the sulfonamide group: the structure is -SO2-NH-Ph? Wait, no. Let me draw it out.\n\nThe SMILES starts with NS(=O)(=O)c1... So the N is bonded to the S. The S has two double bonds to O (sulfonyl). Then, the S is also bonded to the benzene ring (c1). So the group is N-SO2-Ph. But the N here: how many substituents does it have? The N is connected to S, and since it's written as NS..., that N would have two hydrogens (assuming it's NH2). Wait, in SMILES notation, if it's written as N, that's NH3, but in this context, the N is connected to S and two H's? Let me think. The SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)c1... So the N is connected to S. The S is connected to O, O, and the benzene. The N here: the valence would be S(=O)(=O)-N. The N would have two hydrogens because the valence of N is 3. So the group is -SO2-NH2 attached to the benzene? Wait, no. The N is directly attached to the S. The S is connected to two O's (as =O), the N, and the benzene. So the group is benzene-SO2-NH2. Wait, but in the SMILES, the N comes first: NS(=O)(=O)c1... So the N is bonded to S, which is then bonded to the benzene. So the structure is NH2-SO2-benzene? Because the N would have two hydrogens. So that's a primary sulfonamide group: -SO2NH2. So in the input molecule, the first part is the sulfonamide group.\n\nThen, looking at the rest of the molecule: after the benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1), there's an Nc2nccc(...)n2. The part after the first benzene is Nc2nccc(-c3ccc(...)cc3)n2. Let's break that down. The N here is part of an aniline group (attached to the benzene), then connected to a pyridine ring (c2nccc(...)n2). The substituent on the pyridine is a -c3ccc(...)cc3 group, which is another benzene ring. The benzene ring (c3) has a substituent NC(=O)Cc4cccs4. Let's parse that: NC(=O) is a urea or amide group? Wait, NC(=O)Cc4cccs4: the N is connected to a carbonyl (C=O), then a CH2 group (C), then a c4cccs4 which is a thiophene ring (c4ccc(S) \u2013 wait, the SMILES is c4cccs4. So the thiophene is S in position 4, connected via C to the CH2.\n\nSo the NC(=O)CH2-thiophene group is attached to the benzene (c3). But the main point is, in the entire input molecule, how many times does the -SO2NH2 group appear?\n\nLooking back, the initial part of the molecule is NS(=O)(=O)c1..., which is the sulfonamide group. Then, the rest of the molecule doesn't have another SO2NH2 group. Let me check for any other S atoms. The thiophene (c4cccs4) has a sulfur, but that's part of the thiophene ring, not a sulfonamide. The other parts: the NC(=O) group is an amide, not a sulfonamide. The pyridine rings (n and n2) don't have sulfonamides. So the only occurrence of -SO2NH2 is the first part. Therefore, the count should be 1.",

The input molecule's SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)CN2CCN(c3ccccc3)CC2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES of the input molecule. Let's break it down. Starting with the N (nitrogen) attached to a sulfur atom. The sulfur is connected to two oxygen atoms via double bonds (S(=O)(=O)), which makes a sulfonyl group (SO2). Then there's a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1). The substituents on the benzene are the sulfonamide group and another group attached to the nitrogen.\n\nLooking at the sulfonamide part: the structure is NS(=O)(=O)-. A primary sulfonamide would have the structure R-SO2-NH2, where the nitrogen is directly attached to the sulfonyl group and has two hydrogens. In the input molecule, the nitrogen in NS(=O)(=O) is connected to the sulfur and then to a benzene ring. Wait, the N here is attached to the sulfur (SO2) and the benzene. So the structure is N-SO2-benzene. But the fragment they're looking for is -SO2NH2. That would require the nitrogen attached to the SO2 to have two hydrogens. Let me check the input again.\n\nThe SMILES starts with N connected to S. The S has two double-bonded O's. Then the N is connected to the benzene ring (c1ccc...). So the structure is benzene-SO2-N. But the N here is attached to the benzene, the sulfur, and what else? Let's look at the SMILES: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(...). The N here (at the beginning) is connected to the S and then the benzene. So the N is part of the sulfonamide group. But in the fragment, the sulfonamide is -SO2NH2. That would mean the nitrogen has two hydrogens. In the input molecule, does the N in the sulfonamide have two hydrogens?\n\nIn the SMILES notation, if an atom has no explicit bonds or charges, the valence is filled with hydrogens. So the N in NS(=O)(=O)... would have two hydrogens. Because the valence of N is 3. The N is connected to S (1 bond) and the benzene (another bond), so two bonds. Therefore, the remaining valence would be a hydrogen. Wait, no. Valence for nitrogen is typically 3. So if N is connected to S (single bond) and benzene (single bond), that's two bonds. So there should be one more bond, which would be a hydrogen. Wait, but in SMILES, explicit Hs are often omitted. So NS(=O)(=O)c... would have the N connected to S, benzene, and one H. Wait, but primary sulfonamide is R-SO2-NH2. That would require two Hs on the N. But in this case, the N is connected to S and benzene. So it's R-SO2-NHR', where R' is the benzene. That would make it a secondary sulfonamide, not primary. Because primary sulfonamide has NH2, secondary has NHR, tertiary NR2.\n\nSo the fragment given is -SO2NH2 (primary), but in the input molecule, the sulfonamide group is attached to a benzene ring via the nitrogen. Therefore, the nitrogen is part of a secondary sulfonamide (N attached to two groups: SO2 and benzene, plus one H). So that would not match the primary sulfonamide fragment. Therefore, the count should be zero.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The SMILES starts with NS(=O)(=O)c... So the N is connected to S and the benzene (c1...). So the structure is benzene-SO2-NH. But wait, nitrogen's valence: if it's connected to S (single bond) and benzene (single bond), that's two bonds. Then there must be one more H. So the group is -SO2-NH- (with the NH attached to benzene). But that would make it a secondary amine, not primary. Because primary would have NH2. Here, the N has two substituents (S and benzene) and one H. So it's NH with one substituent (but actually two substituents: S and benzene), making it a secondary amine. Therefore, this is a secondary sulfonamide, not primary. Hence, the count is zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another part of the molecule. Let's look at the entire SMILES: NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)CN2CCN(c3ccccc3)CC2)cc1. The benzene ring has two substituents: the sulfonamide group at the first position (NS(=O)(=O)) and another group at the para position (NC(=O)CN2...). Let's check that NC(=O) part. The NC(=O) is a urea or amide group. The N here is connected to the benzene, a carbonyl group (C=O), and then a chain leading to a piperazine-like structure (CN2CCN...). But in that NC(=O), the N is connected to the benzene, the carbonyl, and a CH2 group. So that N has three bonds: benzene, C=O, and CH2. So valence is three, which fits. But that's an amide group, not a sulfonamide. The sulfonamide is the first group. So the only sulfonamide in the molecule is the one attached at the first position. But as we discussed, that's a secondary sulfonamide, not primary. Therefore, the count of primary sulfonamide fragments (-SO2NH2) is zero.",

The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and substituents. Let's start by identifying all the carbonyl (C=O) groups and see if they're connected to an oxygen in the right way to form a carboxylic acid group.\n\nLooking at the SMILES: there's a part C(=O)C3CCC(C(=O)O)CC3. Here, the first C(=O) is part of an amide group (since it's connected to N in CCN(C(=O)...)), so that's a carbonyl but not a carboxylic acid. Then, inside the cyclohexane ring (C3CCC...CC3), there's another C(=O)O. The C(=O)O here is attached to a carbon in the cyclohexane ring. That would be a carboxylic acid group because the carbonyl is directly connected to an -OH group (but wait, in the SMILES it's written as C(=O)O, which is -COO-, but without a hydrogen on the oxygen. Wait, carboxylic acid would be -C(=O)OH, but in SMILES, it's often written as -C(=O)O since the H is implied. So in this case, the fragment is -C(=O)O, which matches the carboxylic acid when protonated. \n\nNow, looking further in the SMILES: Are there other instances of C(=O)O? Let's check the entire structure. The main chain has CC12CCN(...)C(...)C2(C)C. The substituents on the N are C(=O)C3CCC(...)CC3. Then inside that cyclohexane (C3CCC(C(=O)O)CC3), there's one C(=O)O.

The input molecule is O=C(Nc1ccccc1C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O)c1cnccn1, and the fragment we're looking for is the carboxylic acid group with SMILES -C(=O)O. The user wants to know how many times this fragment appears in the molecule.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's structure. Let me write out the SMILES to visualize it better. The molecule has a central structure connected to various groups. Breaking it down:\n\n- The main chain starts with O=C(N...), which is a carbonyl group attached to an amine.\n- The amine (N) is connected to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) which then has another carbonyl group (C(=O)NC...).\n- Following that, there's an NC group connected to a C atom that has two substituents: a benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1) and another carbonyl (C(=O)O).\n- Finally, the central carbonyl is connected to a heterocyclic ring (c1cnccn1), which is a pyrimidine-like ring.\n\nNow, focusing on the carboxylic acid fragment: -C(=O)O. Carboxylic acids have the structure where a carbonyl group is directly attached to an -OH group. But in SMILES, the deprotonated form is often written as -C(=O)O-, but in this case, the fragment is given as -C(=O)O. However, in the molecule, the actual group might be -C(=O)OH, but since SMILES can represent it as -C(=O)O when protonated, but often in structures, especially when part of a larger molecule, it's written as -C(=O)O (like in esters or salts). Wait, but carboxylic acid would be -C(=O)OH. However, the fragment here is specified as -C(=O)O. That might be the deprotonated form, like a carboxylate. But the fragment name is \"carboxylic acids,\" which are protonated. So there might be a discrepancy here. Wait, the user specified the fragment SMILES as -C(=O)O and the name as carboxylic acids. Maybe they're considering the carboxylate group as part of the acid, but that's a bit conflicting. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fragment is the carboxylic acid group, which in SMILES is written as -C(=O)OH. But the given SMILES is -C(=O)O. That might be a carboxylate (lacking the H), but the name says carboxylic acids. So maybe there's a mistake in the fragment SMILES. But the user provided it as such, so I have to go with that.\n\nWait, looking at the input molecule's SMILES: there's a part C(=O)O. Let me check the structure. The molecule is O=C(Nc1ccccc1C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O)c1cnccn1. Let me parse it step by step:\n\nStarting from the leftmost O=C(N...), which is a carbonyl (O=C-) attached to an amine (N). Then there's a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to that amine. Next, that benzene has a C(=O) group (so another carbonyl), then NC(...). The N here is connected to a C atom, which has a substituent Cc1ccccc1 (a benzyl group) and another C(=O)O group. So that C(=O)O is part of the structure: C(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O. So that's a carbon connected to a benzyl group and a -C(=O)O group. Then there's the rest of the molecule.\n\nSo in the molecule, the group -C(=O)O appears once here. Wait, but let me check again. The entire molecule's SMILES is O=C(Nc1ccccc1C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O)c1cnccn1. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first part is O=C(...), which is a carbonyl group.\n2. The N attached to that carbonyl is connected to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1), which then has a C(=O) group attached to another N.\n3. That N is connected to a C atom which has two branches: one is Cc1ccccc1 (a benzyl group) and the other is C(=O)O.\n4. Then the main chain continues with the central carbonyl connected to a pyrimidine ring (c1cnccn1).\n\nSo in this structure, the -C(=O)O group appears once in the part where it's attached to the central nitrogen. Wait, but is there another occurrence? Let me check again. The first carbonyl is O=C(N...), which is part of an amide group, not a carboxylic acid. The next carbonyl is part of another amide (C(=O)NC...). Then the C(=O)O is attached to the central C atom. That's the only occurrence of -C(=O)O in the molecule. Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nBut wait, the fragment name is carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids have the structure R-COOH. In SMILES, that's -C(=O)OH. However, in the given fragment SMILES, it's -C(=O)O. If the fragment is the deprotonated form (carboxylate), then in the molecule, the group is -C(=O)O, which would match. But if the user is looking for the protonated carboxylic acid (-COOH), then the SMILES should be -C(=O)OH. However, the input molecule's SMILES ends with C(=O)O, which would imply a carboxylate (if it's -COO^-), but in the context of the entire molecule, that might be part of an ester or something else. Wait, but the molecule as written has C(=O)O as a terminal group. Let me check if that's possible. For example, if it's a carboxylic acid, the SMILES would be C(=O)OH. But here it's C(=O)O. So maybe it's a carboxylate, like in a salt form. But the user is asking for carboxylic acids. So there's a discrepancy here. However, the user specified the fragment SMILES as -C(=O)O and the name as carboxylic acids. So perhaps they're considering the carboxylate as part of the acid group, maybe in a different context. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is part of a larger group where the oxygen is connected elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the fragment SMILES. But since the problem states that the fragment SMILES is -C(=O)O and the name is carboxylic acids, I have to proceed with that. Therefore, in the input molecule, the group -C(=O)O appears once.

So the N is connected to a central carbon, which is connected to another carbon. So the central carbon is CH2? Wait, perhaps it's a branching point. For example, if the structure is N-C(C)-..., then the central carbon has two bonds: one to N and one to another C. But that would require branching.

Wait, maybe it's a chain: N connected to a C, which is connected to another C. So the N is attached to a CH2 group? Or maybe the C(C) is a branch. Let me think again. The SMILES is written as CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(...). So after the N, there's a C(C), which is connected to a benzene ring (c1...). So the N is connected to a carbon, which has another carbon attached (the C in parentheses). So that would be a central carbon connected to N, another C (as a branch), and the benzene ring. So the structure is N-C(C)- (where the C has two substituents: one is the N and the other is a methyl group, making it a CH(CH3) group? Wait, no. If it's C(C), that means the central carbon is connected to another carbon. So the central carbon has two bonds: one to N, one to another C, and the remaining bonds would be hydrogens. So that's a CH2 group attached to N, but with a branch to another C (methyl). Wait, no. Let's parse this correctly. The SMILES notation for branching uses parentheses. For example, C(C) means that the previous atom (in this case, the N) is connected to a C which has another C attached. So the structure is N-C(C), which would be N connected to a central carbon that has another carbon as a substituent. So the central carbon is CH2 (since it's connected to N and another C), but wait, carbon has four bonds. So the central carbon is connected to N, another C (methyl), and two hydrogens. So that's a CH2CH3 group? Wait, maybe not. Let me think: the sequence is N-C(C). The C after N has a branch: the (C) part. So the C is connected to N and to another C. So the structure is N-C-C, but the second C is a substituent of the first C. So the first C (connected to N) has two substituents: the N and another C. Therefore, the first C has two bonds: one to N and one to C. But carbon must have four bonds. So the first C would have two hydrogens as well. So the structure is N-CH2-C? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the SMILES is written as NC(C), which would be N connected to a carbon, which is connected to another carbon. So the first carbon (after N) has two bonds: one to N and one to another C. The remaining two bonds are hydrogens, making it a CH2 group. Then the next C is a methyl group. Wait, no. Let me try drawing this:\n\nThe part is NC(C). So the N is connected to a central C. That central C is connected to another C. So the central C has bonds: N, C, and two Hs. So the central C is CH2, and the other C is a methyl (since it's just C). Wait, but that would make the central C connected to N, a methyl (C), and two Hs. So the structure is N-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the entire SMILES again.\n\nThe input molecule's SMILES is: CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N(C)CC4CCOC4)ncc3Cl)C2)cc1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CC(=O)N: This is methyl (C) connected to carbonyl (C=O), then connected to N.\n- Then comes C(C): the N is connected to a carbon, which is connected to another carbon (the (C) part). So the structure here is N-C(C). The C after N has a branch to another C. So that carbon is connected to N, another C (methyl), and the rest (the benzene ring, c1...).\n\nSo the N is connected to a carbon that has two substituents: a methyl group (from the C(C)) and the benzene ring. Wait, no. The C(C) is followed by c1..., which is a benzene ring. So the sequence is N-C(C)c1... So the C after N is connected to the benzene ring (c1) and also to another C (from the C(C)). So that central carbon is connected to N, another C (methyl), and the benzene ring. Therefore, that carbon has three bonds: N, C (methyl), and benzene ring. But carbon must have four bonds. So there must be a hydrogen as well. So the structure is N-C(CH3)(c1...) ...?\n\nWait, perhaps the C(C) is a branch. So the N is connected to a central carbon, which branches into another carbon (the (C) part) and continues to the benzene ring. So the central carbon is connected to N, a methyl group (from the C), and the benzene ring. That would make the central carbon a CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be N-CH(CH3)-c1... So that's possible.\n\nBut regardless, the key part for the fragment is the presence of -NC(=O)CH3. The fragment is an amide group where the nitrogen is attached to a carbonyl group and a methyl. But in the input molecule, the first part is CC(=O)N... So that's CH3-C(=O)-N... So the nitrogen here is attached to the carbonyl group (C=O) and a methyl group (from the CH3-C(=O)). Wait, no. The carbonyl is part of the acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-N...). So the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl group (from the acetyl) and to another group (the C(C)... part). So the nitrogen here is part of an amide group: R-C(=O)-N-R'. In this case, R is CH3 and R' is the C(C)... group. So the fragment in question is -N-C(=O)-CH3. But in the input molecule, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-N-..., so the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl and another group. The fragment's structure would require the nitrogen to be connected to the carbonyl and a methyl. But in the input, the carbonyl is attached to a methyl (CH3-C(=O)-N...), and the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl and another group (C(C)...). So the nitrogen is not attached to a methyl here. The methyl is on the carbonyl carbon, not on the nitrogen. Therefore, in the input molecule, the amide group is CH3-C(=O)-N-..., which is an acetyl group attached to an amine. The fragment is looking for an amide where the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl and a methyl. But in the input, the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl (from the acetyl) and to another carbon (C(C)...), not a methyl. So this part might not match the fragment.\n\nWait, the fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. So the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and a methyl (CH3). So the structure is CH3-C(=O)-N-... but in the input molecule, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-N-..., but the nitrogen is connected to another group (C(C)...). So the fragment would require that the nitrogen has a methyl group attached. But in the input, the nitrogen is part of an amide where the carbonyl is from the acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-N-...), and the nitrogen is connected to another carbon (C(C)...). So the nitrogen here has two substituents: the acetyl group and the C(C)... group. Therefore, unless the C(C)... part includes a methyl attached to the nitrogen, which it doesn't, this part does not match the fragment.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another part of the molecule where the fragment appears. Let's look further into the SMILES.\n\nThe rest of the SMILES is: ...OC2CCN(c3nc(N(C)CC4CCOC4)ncc3Cl)C2...\n\nBreaking this down:\n\nAfter the benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1), there's an oxygen (O) connected to C2, which is part of a cyclohexane or similar structure: C2CCN(...)C2. Let's parse that part: OC2CCN(...)C2. The C2 indicates a ring closure. So the structure is O-C-C-C-N(...)-C-C (forming a ring). The N in this part has a substituent: c3nc(N(C)CC4CCOC4)ncc3Cl.\n\nLooking at the substituent on the N in the ring: c3nc(...)ncc3Cl. That's a pyridine ring (c3nc...ncc3Cl) with substituents. The pyridine ring has a chlorine (Cl) and an N(C) group. The N in the pyridine ring is connected to another nitrogen: nc(N(...))... So the pyridine ring has a nitrogen at position 2 (assuming numbering starts where the ring closure is), and another substituent.\n\nLooking at the N(C) part: N(C)CC4CCOC4. This is a nitrogen attached to a methyl group (C) and a chain CC4CCOC4. Wait, the SMILES here is N(C)CC4CCOC4. Let's parse this. The N is connected to a methyl (C) and a chain starting with CC4... So the chain is C-C4-C-C-O-C4. Wait, the CCOC4 part is a bit confusing. The 4 is a ring closure. So CC4CCOC4 would form a ring. Let's see: starting from the first C after CC4, which is C-C-O-C-4. The 4 refers back to the fourth atom in the chain. So the structure would be a five-membered ring? Let's see: C1 (from CC4) connected to C2 (C), C3 (O), C4 (C), and back to C1 via the ring closure. Wait, maybe it's a tetrahydrofuran ring or similar. Let's try:\n\nThe part CC4CCOC4:\n\n- Start with C connected to another C (C-C)\n- Then a ring closure with 4 (but where is the 4?)\nWait, the SMILES is CC4CCOC4. The numbers in SMILES indicate the positions for ring closures. So the first C is connected to the next C (C-C), then the next C is labeled as 4 (C4), then O, then C, and then back to the 4th position. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to write it out:\n\nThe chain is: C - C4 - C - C - O - C4.\n\nSo the first C is connected to the second C (C4), which is part of a ring closure. Then comes another C, then O, then C, and then back to C4. So this forms a five-membered ring: positions 1 (C), 2 (C4), 3 (C), 4 (O), 5 (C), and then back to C4 (position 2). That would form a five-membered ring: C-C-O-C-C, connected back to the second C. Wait, that doesn't form a proper ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a four-membered ring. Let me count:\n\nIf the sequence is C-C4-C-C-O-C4, then the ring closure is between the first C (position 4?) and the last C. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the SMILES is written as CC4CCOC4, which would be:\n\n- The first C (let's call it C1) is connected to C2 (C4, meaning this is the fourth atom in the ring)\n- Then C2 is connected to C3 (C)\n- C3 connected to O\n- O connected to C4 (C)\n- C4 connected back to C2 (via the ring closure 4). Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the ring closure is between C4 and another atom.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is CC4CCOC4, which forms a ring where the fourth atom connects back. Let's try to number:\n\n1. C (from CC4)\n2. C4 (ring closure here)\n3. C\n4. O\n5. C4 (ring closure back to position 2)\n\nWait, that would make a five-membered ring: C-C-O-C-C (positions 2 to 5 connected back to position 2). No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo, but assuming the SMILES is correct, this part is a cyclic structure. Regardless, the key part here is the N(C) group, which is a nitrogen attached to a methyl (C) and a chain that forms a ring. The N(C) implies that the nitrogen has a methyl group attached. So in this part of the molecule, there's an N connected to a methyl (C) and a chain. So this would be a tertiary amine: N(CH3)... So the fragment we're looking for is -NC(=O)CH3, which is an amide with a methyl attached to the nitrogen. But in this part of the molecule, there's an N(CH3)... which is a tertiary amine, not an amide. So that's a different functional group.\n\nTherefore, in the input molecule, the only possible place where the fragment could be is the initial part: CC(=O)N... But as discussed earlier, the nitrogen there is part of an amide group (R-C(=O)-N-R'), where R is CH3 and R' is the C(C)... group. The fragment requires the nitrogen to be attached to both the carbonyl and a methyl. However, in the input molecule, the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl (from the acetyl group) and another carbon (C(C)...), not a methyl. Therefore, the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 does not appear in the input molecule. \n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check. The fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. The hyphen indicates a connection point. So the fragment is the group where the nitrogen is connected to the rest of the molecule. In the input molecule, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-N-... So the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl and the rest of the molecule. The fragment would be if the nitrogen has a methyl attached. But in the input molecule, the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl (from CH3-C(=O)-N) and another carbon (C(C)...), which is not a methyl. So that part doesn't match. \n\nAre there any other parts of the molecule where the nitrogen is attached to a carbonyl and a methyl? Looking at the entire SMILES again: the other nitrogen atoms are in the N(C) part (tertiary amine) and in the pyridine ring (as part of the ring and substituents). The pyridine ring's substituent has an N(C) group, which is again a tertiary amine. \n\nTherefore, the input molecule does not contain the fragment -NC(=O)CH3. The only amide group present is CH3-C(=O)-N-..., where the nitrogen is connected to another carbon, not a methyl. Hence, the count should be 0.",

Let's break it down. The main structure starts with CC(=O)N... which is the acetyl group (O=C-N). Then there's a C(C) attached to the nitrogen, followed by a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1). The ring has an oxygen connected to a cyclohexane-like structure (OC2CCN...C2). The cyclohexane has a nitrogen (N) connected to a pyridine ring (c3nc...ncc3F) and another substituent.\n\nThe fragment given is -NC(=O)CH3. So, looking for the group where the nitrogen is attached to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a methyl group (CH3). In the input molecule, the beginning part is CC(=O)NC(C)... The CC(=O) is the acetyl group. The next part is NC(C), which is a nitrogen connected to a C(C) (isopropyl group?), not a methyl. Wait, the fragment is NC(=O)CH3. The input molecule starts with CC(=O)NC(C)... So the acetyl is O=C-CH3, then connected to N. Wait, the SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)... So that's CH3-C(=O)-N-C(C)... So the N here is connected to the acetyl (C(=O)CH3) on one side and a C(C) on the other. So the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 would be the N connected to the carbonyl and a methyl. But in this case, the N is connected to the carbonyl (from the left) and a C(C) (on the right). Therefore, that's not a match because the fragment requires the N to have the carbonyl and a methyl. Here, the N is connected to the carbonyl (from the left) and a C(C) (which is a methyl attached to another carbon?), so maybe that's not a match.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check again. The fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. That would be the structure where the nitrogen is bonded to the carbonyl group (C=O) and a methyl group (CH3). So looking for instances where the nitrogen has those two substituents.\n\nLooking at the input molecule: the SMILES starts with CC(=O)NC(C)... So breaking it down: CC(=O) is the acetyl group (CH3-C=O), then N is connected to that. The N is connected to the C(C), which is a carbon attached to another CH3 (since C(C) is a carbon connected to two other carbons? Wait, SMILES notation: C(C) would be a CH2 group attached to another carbon. Wait, no. Let's clarify. In SMILES, each carbon is written with its bonds. So \"C(C)\" means a carbon atom (with valence filled by hydrogens) connected to another carbon. So the N is connected to a central carbon (which is connected to another carbon). So the structure around the N is: the N is connected to the carbonyl (from the left, as in the acetyl group) and to a CH(CH3) group? Or wait, the SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C). So the N is connected to the acetyl (C(=O)CH3) and to a C(C), which is a carbon connected to another carbon. So that C(C) would be a CH2CH3? No, wait, \"C(C)\" would be a carbon atom (with three Hs) connected to another carbon. Wait, maybe it's a methyl group? Let me think. The N is attached to a carbon, which is connected to another carbon. So that would be CH2CH3? Wait, no. For example, if it's C(C), that's a central carbon connected to another carbon. So the first carbon (attached to N) has two hydrogens and one connection to another carbon. So that's CH2-C... So the group is -CH2CH3? But in this case, the SMILES is NC(C), which is N-C(C). The C(C) would be a carbon connected to another carbon. So maybe the structure is N-C(CH3) something? Hmm, perhaps I need to draw this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input molecule's SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(... So after the N, there's a C(C) attached, which is part of the benzene ring (c1...). The C(C) here is a carbon attached to another carbon (from the benzene ring) and another carbon (the one attached to N). So perhaps the structure is N-C(C)-c1..., meaning the N is connected to a carbon that's connected to another carbon (which is part of the benzene ring). So that would make the group attached to the N a CH2 group (since the C(C) would have two substituents: one from the N and one from the benzene). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look for the exact structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's only one occurrence of the fragment. The fragment is NC(=O)CH3. In the input molecule, the first part is CC(=O)N... So the acetyl group is O=C-CH3, connected to N. The N is connected to the acetyl and a C(C). So the N here has two substituents: the acetyl (C(=O)CH3) and the C(C). But the fragment requires the N to be connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and a methyl (CH3). In this case, the N is connected to the carbonyl (from the acetyl) and a C(C), which is not a methyl. Therefore, that's not a match. So maybe there's no occurrence? But wait, maybe there's another part of the molecule where the fragment occurs.\n\nLooking further into the molecule: ...OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2). The part here is O connected to a cyclohexane (C2CCN...C2). The N in the cyclohexane (CCN...) is connected to a substituent: c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F. That's a pyridine ring (c3nc...ncc3F) with substituents. The pyridine has an N connected to a N4CCCC4C group. Wait, the N4 is part of a ring? Let's parse that: N4CCCC4C. So that's a four-membered ring: N connected to C, then three Cs, and back to the N (since it's N4...C4). Wait, SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to denote closure. So N4CCCC4C would create a ring where the N is connected to C, then three Cs, and then back to the N via the 4th position. Wait, maybe not. Let me parse it step by step.\n\nThe part is N4CCCC4C. The N is labeled as atom 4. Then C connected to N4, then three Cs in a row, and then another C connected back to N4. So the ring is N4-C-C-C-C-N4? That would form a five-membered ring? Wait, no. If you have N4-C-C-C-C4, that's four atoms between N4 and C4. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me try writing it out: the first atom is N4, then C, then C, then C, then C4. So the ring is N4-C-C-C-C4, which is a five-membered ring? Because N4 is connected to C, then three Cs, and then C4 is connected back to N4. So that's a five-membered ring? But that would require five atoms. Wait, N4 is the first atom, then four Cs, making a five-membered ring. So the ring would be N-C-C-C-C, connected back to the N. So that's a pyrrolidine-like ring, but with all carbons except the N. However, the last atom is C4 connected to N4, forming a five-membered ring. Then the last C in N4CCCC4C is outside the ring? Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to write the SMILES for that part again: N4CCCC4C. So starting at N4, then four Cs (C, C, C, C), then closing the ring with C4. Wait, maybe the SMILES is N4-C-C-C-C-4C. So the ring is formed between N4 and the fourth C, making a five-membered ring (N4, C, C, C, C4). Then there's an additional C attached to the ring. So the structure would be a five-membered ring (N connected to four Cs) with a methyl group attached to the N? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a four-membered ring. Let's see: N4-C-C-C-C4. If the numbers are N4 and C4, that would mean a four-membered ring: N4 connected to C, then two Cs, then C4 connected back to N4. That's four atoms: N, C, C, C. So that's a four-membered ring. But that would require N4-C-C-C-C4, which is five atoms, which can't form a four-membered ring. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the exact structure isn't necessary for counting the fragment.\n\nBack to the fragment. The fragment is NC(=O)CH3. So looking for any occurrence where a nitrogen is directly bonded to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a methyl group (CH3). The input molecule's SMILES starts with CC(=O)NC(C)..., which is the acetyl group (CH3-C(=O)-N-C(C)...). The N here is connected to the acetyl (C(=O)CH3) on one side and a C(C) on the other. So the N has two substituents: the acetyl and the C(C). The C(C) is a carbon connected to another carbon, which would be a CH2CH3 group? Or maybe a branching point? If the C(C) is a carbon with two methyl groups, that would be C(C)(C)... but in this case, it's C(C), so maybe it's a CH2 group attached to another carbon. Either way, the N is connected to the acetyl and a group that is not a methyl (CH3). Therefore, this part does not match the fragment.\n\nLooking elsewhere in the molecule, are there other N's connected to carbonyl groups? The rest of the molecule has an OC2CCN(...)C2 part. The N here is part of the cyclohexane ring (C2CCN...C2). The N in the cyclohexane is connected to a substituent: c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F. This is a pyridine ring (c3nc...ncc3F) with substituents. The pyridine has an N (from the 'n' in the SMILES) and another N connected to the N4CCCC4C group. The N4CCCC4C part is a ring, possibly a four-membered ring with an N and three Cs, but I'm not sure. However, this N (part of the pyridine substituent) is connected to a ring structure, not a carbonyl group. So there's no carbonyl here.\n\nAnother part of the molecule: the input SMILES has an OC2... which is an oxygen connected to a cyclohexane-like structure. The N in that cyclohexane is connected to the pyridine ring. No carbonyl groups here.\n\nThe only carbonyl group in the input molecule is the initial CC(=O), which is part of the acetyl group. The N connected to that acetyl is only connected to the acetyl and the C(C) group. Therefore, there are no other carbonyl groups attached to any other nitrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the fragment NC(=O)CH3 appears only if the N is connected to both the carbonyl and a methyl. In the input molecule, the N is connected to the carbonyl (from the acetyl) and a C(C), which is not a methyl. Hence, the count should be 0.\n\nWait, but wait! The fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. Let me double-check the connectivity. The fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. So the nitrogen is bonded to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) and to a methyl (CH3). In the input molecule, the N is bonded to the carbonyl (from the acetyl, which is C(=O)CH3) and to a C(C). So the N is bonded to the carbonyl group (which is part of CH3-C=O) and another carbon. But the fragment requires the N to be bonded directly to the carbonyl carbon and to a methyl. In the input molecule, the N is bonded to the carbonyl carbon (since the structure is CH3-C(=O)-N-...). So the N is connected to the C=O group (via the acetyl) and to the C(C). Wait, the acetyl is CH3-C(=O)-, and the N is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the N is attached to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) and to another carbon (C(C)). Therefore, the substituents on the N are the carbonyl group (C(=O)CH3) and the C(C) group. The fragment requires the N to be attached to the carbonyl group (C=O) and a methyl (CH3). In the input molecule, the N is attached to the carbonyl (which is part of an acetyl group, but the N's substituents are the carbonyl and the C(C)). So the fragment would require that the N is attached to both a carbonyl and a methyl. But in this case, the N is attached to the carbonyl (which is part of an acetyl, CH3-C=O-) and a C(C). The C(C) is a carbon attached to another carbon, so it's a CH2CH3 group, not a methyl. Therefore, the N does not have a methyl substituent. Hence, the count is 0.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the fragment. The fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. So the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl group (C=O) and a methyl group (CH3). In the input molecule, the N is connected to the carbonyl (from the acetyl) and a C(C). If the C(C) is a methyl group, then it would match. But C(C) in SMILES notation is a carbon attached to another carbon. So the group attached to N would be -CH2CH3 (if the C is a single bond) or another structure. Wait, no. Let's parse the SMILES again: the input molecule starts with CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc...\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CC(=O): CH3-C(=O)-\n- N: connected to the C(=O)\n- C(C): the N is connected to a carbon (let's call it C1), which is connected to another carbon (C2). The C1 is attached to N and C2. So C1 has three bonds: to N, to C2, and two hydrogens (since it's a single bond). So the group attached to N is -CH2-C? But wait, C(C) in SMILES is a carbon connected to another carbon. So the structure would be N-C(CH3) something? No, wait: C(C) would be a carbon atom (C) connected to another carbon (C). So the N is attached to a CH2 group, and that CH2 is attached to another carbon. So the group is -CH2-CH3 (ethyl group). Therefore, the N is attached to an ethyl group, not a methyl. Hence, the fragment (which requires a methyl) is not present here.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 0.",

The molecule has a chain starting with a double bond (C=C), then an oxygen (O), followed by a CC group connected to a nitrogen in a ring (n1c...).

Let me break down the SMILES. Starting with CCC1OC..., there's a cyclic structure (the 'O' suggests an ether or possibly a sugar derivative). The fragment in question is an aldehyde group, which is a carbonyl group (C=O) with a hydrogen attached to the carbonyl carbon. The SMILES for the fragment is -C(=O)H, meaning it's a terminal group.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES, I'll scan for any occurrences of the aldehyde group. The key part here is the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) that's at the end of a chain. In the given SMILES, there's a part that reads CC(C)=O. That's a carbonyl group attached to a carbon which is connected to two other carbons (the CC part). However, the fragment we're looking for is -C(=O)H, which would be a carbonyl group with a hydrogen directly attached. \n\nThe structure CC(C)=O suggests a ketone (since the carbonyl is between two carbons) rather than an aldehyde. Aldehydes have the carbonyl group at the end of the chain, with the structure R-C(=O)H. In the input SMILES, the part CC(C)=O is a ketone because the carbonyl carbon is connected to two other carbons (the C from CC and the C from (C)). Therefore, there's no aldehyde group here. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The SMILES has OC(CC(C)=O), which means the oxygen is connected to a carbon that's connected to another carbon chain. The CC(C)=O part here: the carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's connected to another carbon (the CC part). So that's a ketone, not an aldehyde. Aldehydes would have the carbonyl carbon attached to at least one hydrogen, but here it's attached to two carbons. \n\nTherefore, in the input molecule, there are no terminal aldehyde groups.

Let's break down the SMILES. Starting from the left: CC(=O)NC(C)... So the first part is a methyl group (C) attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), making an acetyl group. Then there's an NC(C), which is an amine connected to another methyl group. The rest is a benzene ring with substituents, but maybe the fragment is only present in the acetyl part.\n\nThe fragment SMILES is -C(=O)CH3. The hyphen at the start suggests it's a substituent connected to something else. So we're looking for the acetyl group attached to another atom.

The molecule starts with COC1CCCN... which is a morpholine ring maybe? Then there's a substituent on the nitrogen: c2nccc(...)n2. That's a pyrimidine ring. On the pyrimidine, there's an amino group attached to another cyclohexane or similar ring via N3CCC... The oxygen in that part (Oc4ccc...) is connected to a benzene ring.

The input molecule is C#Cc1cc(Oc2cnc(NCC(C)O)nc2N)c(C(C)C)cc1OC, and the fragment we're looking for is -C#CH, which is the acetylenes group.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's SMILES to understand its structure. The molecule starts with C#C, which is an acetylene group (a carbon-carbon triple bond). Then there's a benzene ring (c1cc...cc1), with various substituents. Let's break it down.\n\nThe main chain starts with the acetylene group: C#C attached to the benzene ring. Then the ring has an oxygen-containing substituent (Oc2...), which is part of another ring (c2cnc...nc2N). There's an amine group (NCC(C)O) attached there. Also, the benzene ring has a methyl group (C(C)C) and an OCH3 (OC at the end).\n\nNow, the fragment is -C#CH. The SMILES for the fragment is a terminal acetylene group. That means the triple bond is between two carbons, and one of them has a hydrogen attached. In SMILES notation, this would be written as C#CH. However, in the input molecule, the acetylene group is written as C#Cc1..., which means the triple bond is between two carbons, and one is attached to the benzene ring. So the structure here is C#C- (as part of the benzene substituent), but does it have a hydrogen?\n\nIn the input molecule, the acetylene group is C#C connected to the benzene. The SMILES is C#Cc1..., which implies that the acetylene is a substituent on the benzene. The 'c' indicates aromatic carbon. So the acetylene group here is -C#C- attached to the aromatic ring. But the fragment is -C#CH, which is a terminal acetylene. Wait, but in the input molecule, the acetylene is part of a larger structure. Let me think.\n\nThe fragment SMILES is -C#CH, meaning that the triple bond is between C and CH. So the fragment has a hydrogen on the end of the triple bond. In the input molecule, the acetylene is C#C connected to the benzene. The left carbon of the triple bond is connected to the benzene (so it's part of a substituent), and the right carbon is connected to another carbon (the benzene ring's carbon). Wait, no, in the SMILES notation, C#Cc1... means that the triple bond is between the two Cs, and the second C is attached to the benzene ring (the 'c1' part). So the structure is like: the benzene ring has a substituent which is an ethynyl group (-C#C-), but since the benzene is aromatic, the substituent is attached via a single bond. So the actual structure here is -C\u2261C- attached to the benzene. But the fragment is -C#CH, which is a terminal acetylene with a hydrogen. So in the input molecule's acetylene group, does the second carbon have a hydrogen?\n\nIn SMILES, if a carbon in a triple bond is not specified with a hydrogen, it's assumed to have as many hydrogens as needed to satisfy valence. For a triple bond, each carbon in the triple bond has one bond (the triple bond) and the remaining bonds are hydrogens. So for a carbon in a triple bond connected to another carbon and nothing else, each carbon would have one hydrogen. Wait, no: for a triple bond between two carbons, each carbon has one triple bond (counts as three bonds) and one single bond (to another atom or group). Wait, no. Let me think again. A carbon with a triple bond must have two other bonds. For example, in HC\u2261CH, each carbon has one triple bond and one single bond to H. So valence is satisfied. In the input molecule, the SMILES is C#Cc1... So the first C is connected via triple bond to the second C, which is connected to the benzene ring (c1). So the first C (left) is connected via triple bond to the second C, which is connected to the benzene. So the left C (first one) has a triple bond and a single bond to another group? Wait, no. The SMILES is C#Cc1... So the structure is C\u2261C-c1... The left C (first one) is triple bonded to the second C, which is connected to the aromatic carbon (c1). Therefore, the left C (C1) has a triple bond to C2 and another single bond? Wait, no. Wait, in SMILES notation, each atom's bonds are specified. So the first C is connected via triple bond to the second C. The second C is connected to the aromatic carbon (c1). So the first C has a triple bond to C2 and no other bonds. But carbon has a valence of 4. So the first C must have two more bonds, which are implied hydrogens. Wait, but in SMILES, hydrogens are implicit. So for the first C in C#Cc1..., the first C is triple bonded to C2, and has one hydrogen. Because the valence is 4: triple bond (3 bonds) + one hydrogen (1 bond) = 4. So the first C is -C\u2261C- with a hydrogen. Wait, but in that case, the structure would be HC\u2261C- attached to the benzene. Because the first C has a hydrogen. So the fragment in the input molecule is HC\u2261C- as a substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nBut the fragment we're looking for is -C#CH. That would be a terminal acetylene group, i.e., HC\u2261C-R, where R is the rest of the molecule. So in the input molecule, the substituent is HC\u2261C- attached to the benzene. So that would match the fragment -C#CH (since the fragment's SMILES is -C#CH, meaning the acetylene is a substituent with a hydrogen on the end).\n\nTherefore, in the input molecule, there is one occurrence of the HC\u2261C- group attached to the benzene ring. Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but let's check the entire molecule. The input molecule's SMILES is C#Cc1cc(Oc2cnc(NCC(C)O)nc2N)c(C(C)C)cc1OC. Let's parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the left: C#C is the acetylene group. Then c1 starts a benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene ring are:\n\n- The first substituent is at position 1 (since SMILES uses numbers to denote positions in rings). The substituent is the C#C group. So the benzene ring has a HC\u2261C- group attached at position 1.\n\nThen, the rest of the ring substituents: cc(Oc2cnc(NCC(C)O)nc2N) \u2013 this part is a bit complex. Let's see. After the first c (position 1), the next c (position 2) is part of the ring, then position 3 is connected to an O group, which is attached to another ring (c2...). That's probably a substituent on the benzene ring at position 3. Then, at position 4, there's a c connected to a group that includes NCC(C)O. Then, position 5 is another substituent: c(C(C)C), which is a tert-butyl group? And finally, position 6 has cc1OC, which is another substituent (OCH3) at position 6.\n\nBut regardless of the other substituents, the key part is the initial C#Cc1... which indicates the HC\u2261C- group attached to the benzene. So there's one such group in the molecule.\n\nTherefore, the count of the fragment -C#CH (HC\u2261C-) in the input molecule is 1.",

Does that mean any occurrence of =S in the molecule, regardless of what it's attached to? Wait, the fragment name is thiocarbonyl, which specifically refers to C=S. So even if there's an S=S or something else, but in this case, the SMILES is =S. So looking for any double-bonded sulfur atoms.\n\nWait, in the SMILES string, the sulfonamide group is S(=O)(=O). So here, sulfur is double-bonded to oxygen, not carbon. So that's S=O, not S=C. So those don't count. Then, the substituent has C(=S), which is C=S. That's one. Are there any others?\n\nLooking again at the entire SMILES:\n\nNS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=S)NC(=O)c2cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c2)cc1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The N attached to S(=O)(=O) is the sulfonamide. Then the benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1) has a substituent at position 4 (assuming the first substituent is at position 1). The substituent is NC(=S)NC(=O)... So the first part after the benzene is NH-C(=S)-NH-C(=O)-...\n\nSo in the substituent chain, there's one C(=S) and one C(=O). Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe the SMILES is written with another =S elsewhere. Let me check again.\n\nThe entire SMILES is:\n\nNS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(NC(=S)NC(=O)c2cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c2)cc1\n\nLooking for all instances of =S. Let's scan through:\n\n- S(=O)(=O): here, S is double-bonded to O, so =O, not =S.\n\n- NC(=S): here, the =S is attached to C, so that's one.\n\n- Then NC(=O): =O, not S.\n\n- The nitro group is [N+](=O)[O-], so again =O.\n\nSo the only occurrence of =S is in the NC(=S) group. Therefore, the count is 1.\n\nBut wait, the fragment name is thiocarbonyls, which are C=S groups. So the answer should be 1.\n\nI think that's correct. The analysis would mention that there's one thiocarbonyl group in the substituent chain. The sulfurs in the sulfonamide are not part of thiocarbonyl groups. So the count is 1.",

Starting from the left: CC(...)c1ccc(...)c(F)c1. The central part is a cyclopropane ring (C(C(=O)...) attached to another benzene ring (c1ccc...). \n\nLooking at the benzene ring substituents: the first ring (c1ccc(C(F)(F)F)nc1OCc1ccc(F)cc1) has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), an oxygen-connected chain (OCc...), and maybe an amide group (NC...). The second benzene ring (c1ccc(NS(C)(=O)=O)c(F)c1) has a substituent NS(C)(=O)=O, which is the sulfonamide group. \n\nWait, the fragment is -NHSO2CH3. The sulfonamide group is typically -SO2-NH- something. Let's look at the substituent on the benzene ring: NS(C)(=O)=O. Breaking that down, the N is connected to S, which has two (=O) groups and a CH3 (since S(C) is S attached to a methyl). So the group is -N-SO2-CH3. That matches the fragment SMILES -NHSO2CH3. But wait, in the input molecule, is the nitrogen directly attached to the sulfur? Let me check: NS(C)(=O)=O. The N is connected to S, which has two oxygens (as =O) and a methyl (C). So the structure is N-SO2-CH3. But the fragment is -NHSO2CH3. Oh, wait, the fragment has an NH (amine) group. In the input molecule's group, the nitrogen is directly bonded to sulfur. That would make it a sulfonamide where the nitrogen is part of the sulfonamide group (N-SO2-R), but if the fragment is -NHSO2CH3, that would imply that the nitrogen has a hydrogen. So, maybe the input molecule has a sulfonamide group where the nitrogen is attached to the benzene ring and the sulfur, but does it have a hydrogen?\n\nIn SMILES notation, the N in NS(C)(=O)=O would have how many hydrogens? The S is connected to the N, two O's (as double bonds), and a methyl. The nitrogen here is part of a sulfonamide group. Typically, in a sulfonamide, the nitrogen is bonded to the sulfur and two other groups. If the nitrogen is attached to the benzene ring (as in the substituent NS(...)), then the nitrogen would have one hydrogen. Because in the SMILES, the N is written as NS(...), meaning that it's connected to the ring (the benzene) and the sulfur. So the nitrogen would have two bonds (to S and the ring), but since nitrogen typically has three bonds, there must be a hydrogen there. So the group would be -NH-SO2-CH3. So that matches the fragment -NHSO2CH3.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES, how many times does this group occur? The substituent on the benzene ring is NS(C)(=O)=O. That's one occurrence. Let me check the entire structure again. The SMILES is CC(...)c1ccc(NS(...))c(F)c1. The NS(...) part is only in that benzene ring.

Let's check.\n\nLooking at the input SMILES, there's \"SCc2...\" which is a sulfur connected to a carbon (so like -S-C-...). Then there's [S-], which is a deprotonated sulfur, probably a thiolate ion (from a thiol that lost a proton). Thiols are -SH, but if it's deprotonated (as [S-]), it's not a thiol anymore. So in the molecule, are there any -SH groups?\n\nThe \"SCc2...\" part is S connected to C, so that would be a sulfide (R-S-R'), not a thiol. The [S-] is a thiolate.

Breaking that down: the central carbon is connected to an O=C=N group and three benzene rings (each c1ccccc1 represents a benzene ring). The O=C=N part is the isocyanate group. Wait, but the fragment given is -N=C=O. Let me check the order here. The SMILES for the fragment is -N=C=O, which means the nitrogen is connected to the rest of the molecule, followed by a double bond to carbon and then oxygen. In the input molecule, the group is O=C=N. So the order here is O=C=N. That's oxygen double-bonded to carbon, which is double-bonded to nitrogen. But the fragment is N=C=O. Are these the same? Because in SMILES notation, the order matters. O=C=N would be written as O=C=N, while N=C=O would be N=C=O. But chemically, the isocyanate group is typically written as -N=C=O, where the nitrogen is connected to the rest of the molecule. So in the input molecule, the group is O=C=N connected to the central carbon. Wait, maybe I need to visualize this. The central carbon is connected to O=C=N and three benzene rings. But the O=C=N group would have the structure where the central carbon is attached to the N. So the actual group is N=C=O attached to the central carbon. But in the SMILES notation, it's written as O=C=NC. Let me parse the SMILES again. The SMILES is O=C=NC(...). So the sequence is O=C=N connected to the central carbon (C). So the group is O=C=N-C. That would mean the nitrogen is connected to the carbon. So the fragment is N=C=O, but in the molecule, it's O=C=N. Wait, but the actual structure of isocyanate is R-N=C=O. So in the input molecule, the group is O=C=N-C. That would actually be O=C=N-C, which is the same as N=C=O-C. Because in SMILES, the order of atoms matters, but the actual connectivity might allow for different representations. Wait, O=C=N is equivalent to N=C=O if the connectivity is such. But in SMILES, O=C=NC would be O double bonded to C, which is double bonded to N, which is connected to the central C. Alternatively, if it's written as NC(=O)=, but I might be getting confused here. Let me think again. The isocyanate group is R-N=C=O. So the nitrogen is attached to the R group, then double bond to C, which is double bonded to O. In the input molecule, the SMILES is O=C=NC(...). So the sequence is O=C=N attached to the central C. So that would be O=C=N-C. But that would mean the nitrogen is connected to the central C, making the structure R-N=C=O, where R is the central C. So the group here is indeed the isocyanate group. Therefore, there's one occurrence of the isocyanate fragment in the molecule. Let me check again. The molecule has a central carbon connected to O=C=N and three benzene rings. The O=C=N is the isocyanate group. Since there's only one such group attached to the central carbon, the count should be 1. But wait, could there be any other instances? Let me look at the entire structure. The rest of the molecule is three benzene rings attached to the central carbon. There's no other O=C=N group. So the count is 1. Therefore, the answer should be 1.",

The molecule is COS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c2ccccc12. Breaking that down: the \"COS(=O)(=O)\" part is a sulfur atom connected to an oxygen (O) and two sulfonyl groups (=O). Wait, actually, the structure is O=C(O)(S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c2ccccc12). Wait, no, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The SMILES starts with COS(=O)(=O), so that's a methyl group (C) attached to an oxygen (O), which is attached to a sulfur (S) with two sulfonyl oxygens (=O) each. Then connected to a benzene ring: c1ccc(Cl)c2ccccc12. The benzene rings are fused, with a chlorine substituent.\n\nNow, the fragment is -SO3CH3, which is the methyl ester of sulfonic acid. The SMILES for that would be S(=O)(=O)OCH3. Wait, the fragment SMILES given is \"-SO3CH3\". Let me check: the SMILES notation for sulfonic acid methyl ester is indeed O=S(=O)(OCC)...

So the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, which is attached to a sulfonyl group (S with two double-bonded oxygens).

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know how many times the diazo fragment (SMILES: -N#N) appears in the input molecule.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the input molecule's structure. The SMILES given is CCOc1cc(NC(=O)c2ccccc2)c(OCC)cc1[N+]#N. Let me parse that. Breaking it down, the main ring is a benzene (the 'c1cc...cc1' part). Substituents attached to the ring include OCC (ethoxy groups), NC(=O) connected to another benzene ring (c2ccccc2), and [N+]#N at one position. Wait, the [N+]#N part is a diazonium group. The fragment in question is -N#N, which is a diazo group. But here, the nitrogen is positively charged ([N+]). Does that affect the count?\n\nThe fragment SMILES is -N#N, which implies a neutral diazo group. However, the molecule has [N+]#N. The charge might matter. But in some cases, SMILES notation might consider the charge as part of the structure. However, the fragment name is \"diazo,\" which typically refers to the -N=N- group or the azide group. Wait, diazo can sometimes refer to the -N=N- group, but the SMILES here is -N#N, which is an azide group (three nitrogen atoms with triple bond). Wait, but the SMILES given for the fragment is -N#N, which is an azide (like -N\u2261N). However, in the input molecule, the group is [N+]#N. So the central nitrogen is positively charged. Does that mean it's a diazonium group instead of a diazo? \n\nHmm, the fragment name is \"diazo,\" which might be a bit confusing. Diazonium salts usually have [N+]#N and a counterion. But in this case, the fragment is specified as -N#N (without charge), but the actual group in the molecule has a positive charge. So the question is, does the charge affect whether it's considered a match? \n\nThe user is asking to count the number of times the fragment appears in the molecule. If the fragment is defined as -N#N (neutral), but the molecule has [N+]#N (charged), then strictly speaking, they are different. However, maybe the user considers the charged version as part of the fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the SMILES provided for the fragment is incorrect. For example, if the fragment is actually the diazonium group, then the SMILES should be [N+]#N. But the user provided -N#N. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is considering the azide group (-N3), but the SMILES here is written as N#N. Wait, N#N is actually N\u2261N, which is a nitrile group with two nitrogens? Wait, no. SMILES notation: N#N is a triple bond between two nitrogens. So that's a diazenyl group (N\u2261N), but typically, diazo compounds are N=N. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nDiazo compounds usually have a structure R2C=N+=N-. The SMILES for that would be something like C=[N+]=[N-]. But the fragment here is -N#N, which is a triple bond between two nitrogens. That's more like an azide group, but the azide is N-N#N (so three nitrogens). Wait, the SMILES -N#N would be two nitrogens with a triple bond. But that's not a common group. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps the user intended the azide group, which would be N-=N+=N, but that's three nitrogens. \n\nWait, the input molecule has [N+]#N. Let me look at that part. The [N+] indicates a positively charged nitrogen. Then #N is a triple bond to another nitrogen. So the structure is [N+]#N, which is N\u2261N+? Wait, the SMILES notation would be [N+]#N, which is a nitrogen with a positive charge triple-bonded to another nitrogen. That's a diazonium ion? Diazonium ions are typically Ar-N+\u2261N, where Ar is an aromatic ring. So in the input molecule, the benzene ring has a substituent [N+]#N. So that's a diazonium group attached to the benzene. \n\nBut the fragment given is -N#N (without the charge). So the question is, does the charge matter in the matching? If the fragment is defined as -N#N (neutral), but the actual group in the molecule is [N+]#N, then they are not the same. However, perhaps the user is considering the presence of the N#N group regardless of charge. But according to SMILES matching, charges are part of the structure. So unless the fragment SMILES includes the charge, the two would not match. \n\nSo in this case, the input molecule has one occurrence of [N+]#N. The fragment SMILES is -N#N. Since the fragment doesn't include the charge, but the molecule's group does, they don't match. Therefore, the count would be zero. But that seems counterintuitive. Maybe the user made a mistake in the fragment SMILES, intending [N+]#N instead. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is using a generic approach, ignoring charges. But according to SMILES rules, charges are part of the structure. So the matching should be exact. Therefore, the count is zero. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is intended to match any N#N group, regardless of charge. But in that case, the SMILES would need to be written as [N+,#N] or something, which isn't standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fragment is written as -N#N, meaning that the triple bond is between two nitrogens, and the rest is substituents. In the molecule, the [N+]#N would have the triple bond, so maybe the charge is ignored for the purpose of matching. But in standard SMILES matching, the charge is part of the atom's definition. So if the fragment doesn't specify the charge, it won't match a charged atom. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the fragment -N#N does not match the [N+]#N group in the molecule. Therefore, the count is zero. But wait, the fragment name is \"diazo,\" which usually refers to a different structure. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Diazo is typically R-N=N-X, but maybe in this case, the user is referring to the azide group or the diazonium group. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fragment SMILES is incorrect, and it should be [N+]#N. In that case, the count would be one. But the user provided the fragment SMILES as -N#N and name as diazo. If the user intended the diazonium group, then the SMILES should have the charge. \n\nGiven the information provided, the input molecule has one [N+]#N group, and the fragment is -N#N. Since the charges don't match, the count is zero. However, maybe the user is not considering the charge. But according to strict SMILES matching, charges are considered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES parser being used is ignoring charges. But the user's instruction is to use the given SMILES. So the answer would be zero. But that seems unlikely. Maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the diazo group here is considered as N#N regardless of charge. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecule has the N#N group with a charge, but the fragment is looking for the N#N substructure, regardless of charge. In that case, maybe the count is one. Because the triple bond between the two nitrogens is present, even with a charge. So maybe the charge is ignored. \n\nBut in SMILES notation, the atoms are specified with their charges. So if the fragment is written as [N+]#N, it would match, but as -N#N, it wouldn't. Therefore, the count is zero. \n\nWait, but looking at the input molecule's SMILES: ...cc1[N+]#N. So the last part is [N+]#N. The [N+] is connected via a triple bond to N. So the structure is N\u2261N+ attached to the benzene ring. But the fragment is -N#N, which would be N\u2261N without the charge. \n\nTherefore, the exact match isn't present. So the count should be zero. However, if the user is considering the N#N part without worrying about the charge, then the count is one. But according to SMILES rules, the charge is part of the atom's identity. So the answer would be zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the fragment to be [N+]#N, but wrote it as -N#N. In that case, it's a mistake. But as per the given data, the fragment SMILES is -N#N. \n\nSo, given that, the count is zero. But that seems counterintuitive because the molecule does have a diazonium group. But the fragment name is \"diazo,\" which might be a misnomer here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers the diazo group as any N#N-containing group, regardless of charge. In that case, the count would be one. \n\nBut according to strict SMILES matching, the answer is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES is written as -[N+]#N, but the user omitted the charge. So in that case, it's a mistake. \n\nBut since the user provided the fragment SMILES as -N#N, I have to go with that. Therefore, the count is zero. \n\nBut wait, the input molecule has [N+]#N. Let me check the SMILES again. The [N+] is one atom, triple bonded to N. So the group is N\u2261N+. The fragment is N#N, which is N\u2261N. So the presence of the charge on one N makes it a different structure. Therefore, no match. \n\nHence, the count is zero. But that's confusing because the fragment name is \"diazo,\" which might refer to the diazonium group. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the fragment SMILES. But given the data provided, the count is zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the charge is part of the molecule's structure but not part of the fragment. For example, if the fragment is considered as N#N regardless of charge, then the count would be one. But that's not standard. \n\nIn summary, the correct answer depends on whether the charge is considered. If the fragment is -N#N (no charge), then the count is zero. If the fragment is intended to be [N+]#N, then count is one. Since the user provided the fragment as -N#N, the count is zero. \n\nBut this seems conflicting with the fragment name \"diazo,\" which typically refers to a different structure. However, based on the given SMILES, the answer must be zero. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is count: 0. \n\nBut wait, let me check the input molecule again. The SMILES is CCOc1cc(NC(=O)c2ccccc2)c(OCC)cc1[N+]#N. So the [N+]#N is at the end. That's one occurrence. The fragment is -N#N. So maybe the SMILES for the fragment is written without the charge, but the actual group in the molecule includes the charge. So no match. \n\nTherefore, count: 0.",

First, I need to analyze the structure of the input molecule.\n\nLooking at the SMILES notation: The molecule starts with O=S(=O)([O-]), which is a sulfonic acid group but deprotonated, as indicated by the [O-]. The rest of the molecule is a bicyclic aromatic system with a chlorine atom and a fused ring containing a nitrogen.\n\nThe fragment given is -SO3H. However, in the input molecule, the sulfur is connected to three oxygen atoms (two double bonds and one single bond with a negative charge). The sulfonic acid group typically has the structure -S(=O)(=O)OH. When deprotonated, it becomes -SO3^- (like in the input molecule here).\n\nSince the fragment specified is the protonated form (-SO3H), but the input molecule has the deprotonated form (-SO3^-), I need to check if they are considered the same. In some contexts, especially when considering functional groups, the protonated and deprotonated forms might be considered equivalent, especially if the task is about identifying the presence of the sulfonic acid group regardless of its ionization state.\n\nIn this case, the input molecule has one sulfonic acid group, albeit deprotonated.

The input molecule's SMILES starts with O=S(=O)([O-]), which matches the deprotonated sulfonate group. So, the fragment here is the sulfonic acid (-SO3H), but the molecule has the sulfonate ion (-SO3^-). Depending on the context, they might be considered the same functional group, just in different ionization states. However, strictly speaking, the count of -SO3H groups would be zero here because it's in the deprotonated form. But maybe the question expects to count the sulfonate as the sulfonic acid group, assuming it's derived from it. That's a common consideration in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, the answer is 1. The molecule contains one sulfonic acid group in its deprotonated form. Unless the question strictly requires the protonated form, in which case it's zero. But given that the fragment name is \"sulfonic acid,\" which is the protonated form, there's a conflict. Hmm.

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The input molecule is O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2)[C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1, and the fragment is -SO3H (sulfonic acid). I need to count how many times the fragment appears in the molecule.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the fragment SMILES: -SO3H. That represents a sulfonic acid group, which is -S(=O)(=O)OH. But in the molecule, the groups might be deprotonated or in a different form. The input molecule has two sulfur atoms attached to oxygen groups. Let me break down the molecule structure.\n\nThe molecule has a central 1,3-thiazolidine ring (S1 as the first atom). The substituents on the ring are: one S(=O)(=O)[O-] group and another S(=O)(=O) group attached to the carbons. Wait, looking closer: the first sulfur (S1) is part of the ring with two oxygens double-bonded (O=S1(=O)...). Then there's another sulfur in the substituent: [C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1. So that's S(=O)(=O)O- as a substituent. \n\nThe sulfonic acid group is -SO3H. However, in the molecule, the substituent is S(=O)(=O)[O-], which is the deprotonated form, sulfonate (-SO3^-). But the fragment given is the protonated sulfonic acid (-SO3H). So do I count the sulfonate groups as sulfonic acid? Depending on the context, sometimes sulfonate is considered as the conjugate base of sulfonic acid. But if the fragment is specifically -SO3H, then the deprotonated form might not match. However, maybe the question counts both the acid and its conjugate base. Let me check the problem statement again. The fragment SMILES is -SO3H, so it's the protonated form. But the molecule has -SO3^- groups. Unless during the analysis, the user considers the presence of sulfonate as equivalent, but strictly speaking, the SMILES for the fragment is -SO3H, which has a hydroxyl group. The molecule has two sulfur atoms with S=O groups. Wait, let me count:\n\nLooking at the molecule structure: the first sulfur (S1) is in the ring with two double bonds to oxygen (O=S1(=O)... So that's a sulfoxide group (S=O), but the substituent on the ring is [C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1. That's a sulfonate group (-SO3^-). The other substituent on the ring is Nc2ccccc2 (aniline group). So in total, how many -SO3H groups are present? The molecule has one sulfonate group (-SO3^-) and the central sulfur might be a sulfoxide (S=O). Therefore, the sulfonate group (the substituent) is -SO3^- which would correspond to -SO3H in its protonated form. However, since the fragment is -SO3H, and the molecule has -SO3^- (as part of the structure), perhaps under certain conditions (like in acidic environment) it could be protonated. But the question is about counting the fragment as present in the given structure. Since the structure shows the deprotonated form, does that count? Or should we consider that the sulfonate is a derivative of sulfonic acid and count it as one? The SMILES matching would need to see if the sulfonic acid group is present. The sulfonate is the conjugate base, so if the fragment is the acid, then the count would be zero. But maybe in this context, they consider sulfonate as part of the count. Let me check the actual groups. The substituent is S(=O)(=O)[O-], which is -SO3^- (sulfonate). The sulfonic acid would be S(=O)(=O)OH. So the molecule has a sulfonate group, not the sulfonic acid. Therefore, according to the exact SMILES given (-SO3H), the count should be zero. But wait, the input molecule might have two sulfonic acid groups. Wait, let's re-examine the SMILES. The input molecule is O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2)[C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1. So, the sulfur in the ring (S1) has two double bonds to oxygen (O=S1(=O)), which makes it a sulfone group (two S=O bonds). The other sulfur is in the substituent: S(=O)(=O)[O-]. That's a sulfonate group (three oxygens: two double bonds and one O-). So the substituent is a sulfonate, not a sulfonic acid. Therefore, the molecule has one sulfonate group. The fragment is sulfonic acid (-SO3H), so in the molecule, there's no -SO3H group present. Hence, the count should be zero. Wait, but maybe there's another group. Let me check again. The molecule has two sulfur atoms: S1 in the ring and the substituent S. S1 is part of the ring structure with O=S(=O), so that's a sulfonyl group (like in sulfones). The substituent S is S(=O)(=O)[O-], which is sulfonate. So the sulfonic acid would be S(=O)(=O)OH. The molecule's substituent is S(=O)(=O)O^- (sulfonate), so unless the molecule is in an acidic environment where the sulfonate is protonated, it's not present as -SO3H. Therefore, in the given structure, there are zero -SO3H groups. However, maybe the user is considering sulfonate as equivalent to sulfonic acid for counting purposes. But according to the SMILES provided, the fragment is -SO3H, so the count should be zero. But I'm confused because sometimes people might refer to sulfonate as sulfonic acid in salt form. But in the SMILES, the fragment is explicitly -SO3H. Therefore, the correct count is zero. Wait, but wait another look: the substituent is S(=O)(=O)[O-], which is the deprotonated form. If the original structure is a sodium salt, for example, the sulfonic acid would be present in the protonated form. But in the given SMILES, the substituent is [O-], so it's deprotonated. Therefore, the count is zero. But perhaps the user made a mistake, or the question expects to count the sulfonate as a sulfonic acid group. Let me think again. If the fragment is sulfonic acid (-SO3H), but in the molecule it's present as sulfonate (-SO3^-), then unless the problem counts the ionized form, the count is zero. However, sometimes in such contexts, people count the group regardless of ionization state. For example, a carboxylate (-COO^-) might be considered as a carboxylic acid (-COOH) in counting. If that's the case here, then the sulfonate would count as one sulfonic acid group. The SMILES for the fragment is -SO3H, but the molecule has -SO3^-. If we consider the presence of the sulfonate as derived from sulfonic acid, then count is 1. But strictly speaking, the SMILES must match exactly. Since the fragment is -SO3H and the molecule has -SO3^-, they are different. Therefore, the correct count is zero. But I might be missing something. Let me check the substituent again. The substituent is S(=O)(=O)[O-]. That's three oxygen atoms attached to sulfur: two double bonds and one single bond with a negative charge. Sulfonic acid would have S(=O)(=O)OH. So the substituent here is the deprotonated form, so it's sulfonate, not sulfonic acid. Therefore, the count is zero. But wait, the molecule might have another sulfonic acid group. Looking again at the input molecule: O=S1(=O)C[C@@H](Nc2ccccc2)[C@@H](S(=O)(=O)[O-])C1. The S1 is part of the ring with two double bonds to oxygen. That's a sulfone group (O=S=O), which is different from sulfonic acid. Sulfonic acid has three oxygen atoms attached, one of which is a hydroxyl. So the sulfone (S=O) groups are not sulfonic acid. The only possible sulfonic acid group is the substituent, which is sulfonate. Therefore, the count is zero. However, maybe the user intended the sulfonate to be counted as sulfonic acid. If so, the count would be 1. But based on the given fragment SMILES, which is -SO3H, the correct answer should be zero. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the SMILES parsing. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is a 5-membered ring: S1 is the first atom, connected to O (double bond), then a carbon connected to another carbon, then a carbon connected to the substituent Nc2ccccc2, then another carbon connected to the substituent S(=O)(=O)[O-], and back to S1. So the ring is S1-C-C-C-C. The S1 has two double bonds to O (O=S1(=O)...), making it a sulfone. The substituent on the fourth carbon is S(=O)(=O)[O-], which is a sulfonate group. Therefore, in the entire molecule, there is one sulfonate group and one sulfone group. The sulfonate is -SO3^-; thus, the count for -SO3H is zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero. But I need to make sure. Another possibility: sometimes sulfonic acid groups can be part of a ring, but in this case, the sulfone is part of the ring and not a sulfonic acid. So the count remains zero. Therefore, the final answer is count: 0.",

The input molecule is O=C(N=C=S)c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1F, and the fragment we're looking for is -N=C=S, which is called isothiocyanate.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule's SMILES. The main structure seems to be a benzene ring (c1cccc...c1F). Attached to the ring are a couple of groups. Let me break it down:\n\nThe benzene ring has substituents at two positions. One is a carbonyl group (O=C), which is connected to another group: N=C=S. The other substituent on the ring is a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) and a fluorine atom.\n\nWait, the SMILES is O=C(N=C=S)c1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1F. So the carbonyl group (O=C) is attached to the N=C=S group, making that part O=C-N=C=S. Then this whole group is attached to the benzene ring. The benzene ring also has the trifluoromethyl and another fluorine.\n\nNow, the fragment we're looking for is -N=C=S. Let me check if that exact group exists in the molecule. The molecule has O=C-N=C=S. The fragment is the N=C=S part, but in the molecule, it's connected to the carbonyl group (O=C-). So the N=C=S here is part of a larger group. But the question is, does the fragment -N=C=S occur as a separate group? Or is it part of a larger functional group?\n\nWait, the fragment is specified as -N=C=S. The SMILES notation for the fragment is -N=C=S, which implies that the nitrogen is connected to something else (the hyphen indicates a bond to another atom). In the input molecule, the N in N=C=S is bonded to the carbonyl carbon (O=C-N=C=S). So the N=C=S is indeed present as a substituent here. Since the fragment is defined as -N=C=S, meaning the N is connected to the rest of the molecule, in this case, the N is connected to the carbonyl group. Therefore, the N=C=S fragment is present once in the molecule.\n\nAre there any other instances where N=C=S might appear? Let me look again. The benzene ring substituents are the O=C(N=C=S) group and the C(F)(F)F plus another F. There's no other N in the molecule. So the count should be 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe the SMILES for the fragment is written as -N=C=S, which is a substituent. In the molecule, the N=C=S is attached via the N to the carbonyl group. So that's exactly one occurrence. The fragment isn't repeating anywhere else in the structure. So the count is 1.",

I need to count how many times this fragment appears in the molecule.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the input molecule. The SMILES notation is a bit complex. Let's break it down. The core seems to be a bicyclic structure. Starting with N#[N+], which is a diazonium group (since it's N triple bond to N+). Then there's a benzene ring attached via a carbon (the -c3ccccc3 parts). \n\nThe fragment in question is -N#N. Wait, but in the input molecule, the group is N#[N+], which is a diazonium ion. The fragment is the diazo group, which is typically N#N without the charge. However, the diazo group can sometimes be in different protonation states. But the SMILES given for the fragment is -N#N, which is neutral. \n\nSo, the input molecule has a N#N+ group. The charge might affect whether it's considered a match. The fragment is specified as -N#N, which is neutral. Therefore, the diazonium ion (charged) might not match the neutral diazo fragment. But I need to check if the user is considering any form, including charged. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the molecule has other instances of N#N. Let's look again. The SMILES is N#[N+]c1[nH]nc2nnc(-c3ccccc3)c(-c3ccccc3)c12. The initial part is N#[N+] which is the diazonium ion. Then there are other nitrogen atoms in the rings. Are there any other N#N groups? Let me parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nThe main chain starts with N#[N+] connected to a carbon (c1...). Then there's a ring structure with nitrogens: [nH], nc2, nnc... So in the rings, there are nitrogens connected by single bonds. For example, the part 'nnc' would be two nitrogens connected by a single bond. But that's N-N, not N#N. The only triple bond is in the initial N#[N+]. \n\nSo the only occurrence of N#N is in the diazonium group, but it's charged (N+). The fragment specified is -N#N, which is neutral. So unless the charge is ignored (which it shouldn't be in SMILES matching), then there's a discrepancy. However, sometimes in such cases, the user might be looking for the structural motif regardless of charge. But strictly speaking, the SMILES for the fragment is neutral, and the molecule has a charged version. \n\nBut wait, the fragment name is \"diazo\", which typically refers to the neutral N#N group. However, diazonium ions are a different species. So maybe the count here is zero because the molecule has a diazonium ion (N#N+) but the fragment is diazo (N#N). Alternatively, if the user is considering the diazonium as a form of diazo, maybe it's counted. But according to the SMILES given for the fragment (-N#N), which is neutral, the molecule doesn't have that exact group. \n\nTherefore, the count should be zero. But wait, maybe the diazonium group is considered a derivative. Let me double-check. The diazo group is usually R-N=N-R, but sometimes refers to N#N. Wait, the fragment SMILES is -N#N, which is a triple bond. Diazonium is N#N+ with a positive charge. So structurally, they are similar but differ in charge. Unless the user is considering charged groups as part of the fragment, which isn't indicated here. \n\nSo, in the input molecule, there's only one occurrence of N#N+, but the fragment is N#N. Therefore, the count would be zero. Wait, but maybe the fragment is part of a larger structure. Let me look again. The fragment SMILES is -N#N, which is a terminal group. The input molecule has N#[N+] connected to a carbon. The N#N+ is part of the molecule as a substituent. If the fragment is just the N#N group, regardless of charge, then maybe count it as one. But the SMILES explicitly includes the charge in the input molecule. Since the fragment's SMILES is neutral, it's a different structure. \n\nTherefore, the correct count should be zero. But I might be missing something. Let me check if there's any other part of the molecule with N#N. The SMILES string is N#[N+]c1[nH]nc2nnc(-c3ccccc3)c(-c3ccccc3)c12. The only triple bond is between the first N and the N+. The rest are single or aromatic bonds. So no other N#N groups. \n\nThus, the count is zero. But wait, the fragment name is diazo. Diazonium is a different term. So perhaps the user intended to count the diazonium group as diazo. But according to the given SMILES, the fragment is -N#N, which is neutral. Hence, no match.

The SMILES starts with O=C=Nc... which looks like an isocyanate group attached to a benzene ring. The isocyanate group is -N=C=O, right? But wait, the SMILES here is O=C=Nc. That would be O=C=N- attached to the benzene ring. Wait, the order in SMILES matters. The isocyanate group is usually N=C=O, so the SMILES would be N=C=O. But in the input molecule, it's written as O=C=Nc. That's O connected to C, which is connected to N, which is connected to the benzene ring (c1). So the structure here is O=C=N- attached to the benzene ring. That is indeed the isocyanate group. So the fragment is present once here.\n\nBut wait, the fragment SMILES given is -N=C=O. The hyphen indicates that it's a substituent. In the input molecule, the group is O=C=N- attached to the ring. So the order is O=C=N versus N=C=O. Are these the same? Because in SMILES, the directionality can matter. Let me think. The isocyanate group is -N=C=O. The SMILES for that would be N=C=O, but when it's attached to something else, like a benzene ring, the connection is through the nitrogen. So in the input molecule, the group is O=C=N-c1... which would be the same as N=C=O attached to the ring. Wait, SMILES is directional. So O=C=N-c1 is equivalent to the nitrogen being connected to the ring, with the C=O next. So the fragment is present as -N=C=O. So yes, that's one occurrence.\n\nNow, looking at the rest of the molecule.

That part is a methyl group (C) attached to an oxygen (O), which is connected to a sulfur (S) with two sulfonyl (=O) groups.

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many times the fragment -SO2NH2 (primary sulfonamide) appears in the input molecule. Let me start by looking at the structure of the input molecule. The SMILES given is NS(=O)(=O)NCC1CCCc2cc(S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3)ccc21.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the SMILES to understand the structure. The molecule has two sulfur atoms in sulfonyl groups. The first part is NS(=O)(=O)N, which looks like a sulfonamide group because it's N attached to SO2, which is connected to another N. Then there's a cyclohexane ring (from NCC1CCC...) connected to a benzene ring (c2cc...ccc21). The benzene ring has another sulfonyl group attached: S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3. Let me break this down.\n\nThe primary sulfonamide group is -SO2NH2. The key here is that the sulfonamide must have the SO2 group connected directly to an NH2 group. A primary sulfonamide has the structure R-SO2-NH2, where the NH2 is not substituted, meaning the nitrogen is only attached to the SO2 and two hydrogens.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, the first part is NS(=O)(=O)N. Wait, that's N-SO2-N. So the nitrogen after the SO2 is connected to another nitrogen. That would make it a secondary sulfonamide, not primary, because the nitrogen in the sulfonamide is attached to another N (as in a urea group or something). So that group is N-SO2-N-C..., so the sulfonamide here is N-SO2-N, which is a secondary amine, not primary. Therefore, that part isn't a primary sulfonamide.\n\nThen, looking at the other part of the molecule: there's another S(=O)(=O) group attached to the benzene ring. The SMILES here is S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3. The sulfur is connected to a benzene ring (c3) and two oxygens. The group is S(=O)(=O)-c3..., but the nitrogen here? Wait, the sulfonamide would need a NH2 group attached to the SO2. In this case, the SO2 is attached to the benzene ring (c3), so that's a sulfone (SO2) connected to an aromatic ring, not a sulfonamide. Because sulfonamide requires the SO2 to be connected to an amine. Here, the SO2 is connected to the benzene, so that's a sulfone group, not a sulfonamide. So that part doesn't count either.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The entire molecule's SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)NCC1CCCc2cc(S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3)ccc21. Breaking it down:\n\nThe first part is N-S(=O)(=O)-N-C-C... So the first S is part of a sulfonamide group? The structure is N-SO2-N-C. So the SO2 is between two nitrogens. The first nitrogen (leftmost) is connected to SO2 and then another nitrogen. So the group is H2N-SO2-N-C...? Wait, maybe not. Let's consider the actual structure. The SMILES notation starts with NS(=O)(=O)N. So the first N is connected to the S, which has two double bonds to O. Then the S is connected to another N. So the structure would be HN-SO2-N... But wait, the valence here. The sulfur in SO2 has four bonds: two double bonds to O, one single bond to the first N, and one single bond to the second N. So the group is N-SO2-N. So the first N (left) has two H's (since it's a primary amine?), but if it's connected to the S and then another N, that might make it a secondary amine. Wait, maybe I should draw this.\n\nThe leftmost N is part of the group NS(=O)(=O)N. So the first N has three bonds: one to S, and two Hs (since N typically has three bonds unless charged). But wait, the S is connected to two O's (as double bonds) and two N's. Wait, no. The S in sulfonamide is connected to two O's (double bonds), one N (the amine), and another group (the R group). In this case, the S is connected to two O's (as =O), the first N (from NS(=O)(=O)), and then another N (as NCC...). So the structure is N-SO2-N-C... So the sulfonamide here would have the SO2 connected to two N atoms. But a primary sulfonamide is R-SO2-NH2. If the NH2 is attached directly to the SO2, that's primary. If the N has another substituent (like another R group), then it's secondary or tertiary.\n\nIn the input molecule, the first N is attached to the S, then the S is attached to another N. So the group is N-SO2-N. The left N (from NS(=O)(=O)) would have two H's (since N is in a -NH- group?), but wait, if the N is connected to S and another N, then that's a sulfamoyl group (like H2N-SO2-N-...). Wait, maybe that's a sulfamide (like urea but with SO2 instead of CO). So that would be a sulfamide group, which is different from a sulfonamide. A sulfonamide is R-SO2-NR2, where R can be H or other groups. For primary sulfonamide, the N has two Hs. So if the N attached to SO2 has two Hs, that's primary. But in this case, the N attached to SO2 is connected to another N. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe SMILES starts with NS(=O)(=O)N. So the first N is connected to the S. Then the S has two double bonds to O. Then the S is connected to another N. So the first N's bonds are: one to S, and probably two Hs (since it's NH2). Then the S is connected to another N (which is part of NCC1...). So the structure would be H2N-SO2-N-CH2... So the N in the middle (attached to SO2 and the other N) is part of a NH group? Wait, the second N is part of NCC1... So that N is connected to the S, a CH2, and maybe another H. Wait, maybe the structure is H2N-SO2-N-CH2-CH2... So the sulfonamide here is H2N-SO2-N-... But the N attached to the SO2 has two Hs (from H2N-) and then is connected to another N (from -N-CH2...). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me parse the SMILES correctly.\n\nThe SMILES is NS(=O)(=O)NCC1CCCc2cc(S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3)ccc21.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- N: a nitrogen atom. This is the first atom.\n- S(=O)(=O): sulfur with two double-bonded oxygens.\n- N: another nitrogen connected to the sulfur.\n- C: a carbon connected to the previous N.\n- C1: a carbon that's part of a ring (ring closure label 1).\n- Then the rest of the structure: CCc2cc... which includes another ring.\n\nSo the first part is N-S(=O)(=O)-N-C-C... So the first N is connected to the S, which is connected to another N. The first N (leftmost) would have two Hs (since it's NH2?), then the S, then another N which is connected to a CH2 group.\n\nSo the group here is H2N-SO2-NH-CH2... Wait, but the N after the S is connected to the S and a CH2. So that would make the structure H2N-SO2-NH-CH2... But in that case, the N attached to the S has one H (since it's connected to S and CH2). Wait, but NH would have two Hs. Wait, the N after the S is connected to S and C (from the NCC1... part). So that N has three bonds: S, C, and another H. So the structure is H2N-SO2-NH-CH2... So the sulfonamide here is H2N-SO2-NH-, making it a secondary sulfonamide because the N attached to SO2 has one H (since it's NH- connected to CH2). Therefore, that's a secondary sulfonamide, not primary.\n\nThen, looking at the other part of the molecule: there's another S(=O)(=O) group attached to a benzene ring (c2cc...). The S here is connected to the benzene ring (c) and two oxygens. But there's no NH2 attached here. Instead, the S is part of a sulfone group (SO2) connected to the aromatic ring. So that part is a sulfone, not a sulfonamide.\n\nTherefore, in the entire molecule, the only possible sulfonamide group is the first part, but it's a secondary sulfonamide because the N attached to SO2 is connected to another N (from the H2N-SO2-NH-... structure). Therefore, there are no primary sulfonamide (-SO2NH2) groups in this molecule. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.\n\nPrimary sulfonamide is R-SO2-NH2. The NH2 must be directly attached to the SO2. In the input molecule, the first group is H2N-SO2-N-... So the NH2 is attached to the SO2, but then the SO2 is attached to another N. Wait, no. The SO2 is between two N atoms. The left N is NH2, and the right N is part of a NH group connected to CH2. So the structure is NH2-SO2-NH-CH2... So the SO2 is connected to two amines. That would make it a sulfamide (like H2N-SO2-NH-R), which is a different functional group. Sulfonamides are R-SO2-NR2, where one of the R's is H for primary. In this case, the SO2 is between two amines, so it's a sulfamide linkage, not a sulfonamide. Therefore, that part isn't a sulfonamide at all.\n\nWait, maybe I confused sulfonamide with sulfamide. Sulfonamide is when the SO2 is connected to one amine group. Sulfamide is when the SO2 is connected to two amine groups. So in this molecule, the first part is a sulfamide (H2N-SO2-NH-), which is not a sulfonamide. Therefore, there are no sulfonamide groups here. But the fragment given is primary sulfonamide (-SO2NH2). So if there are no sulfonamide groups, the count would be zero.\n\nBut let me check the other S(=O)(=O) group. The second one is part of the benzene ring: c2cc(S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3)ccc21. Here, the S is connected to the benzene ring (c) and another benzene ring (c3...). The structure is S(=O)(=O)c3..., meaning the S is attached to the c3 ring. So that's a sulfone group (Ar-SO2-Ar), not a sulfonamide. Sulfonamide would require a NH2 attached to the SO2. Here, there's no N attached to that SO2. So that's a sulfone, not a sulfonamide.\n\nTherefore, in the entire molecule, there are no primary sulfonamide (-SO2NH2) groups. The first part is a sulfamide, and the second S is a sulfone. So the count should be zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the SMILES. Let me look again. The input molecule's SMILES: NS(=O)(=O)NCC1CCCc2cc(S(=O)(=O)c3cccc(F)c3)ccc21.\n\nBreaking it down step by step:\n\n1. The first N (position 1) is connected to S (position 2).\n2. S (2) has two double bonds to O (positions 3 and 4).\n3. S (2) is also connected to N (position 5).\n4. N (5) is connected to C (position 6).\n5. C (6) is connected to C (position 7), which is part of a ring (ring closure 1).\n6. The rest of the structure forms a bicyclic system with rings 1 and 2.\n7. The second S(=O)(=O) group is attached to the benzene ring (position c2...), connected to another benzene ring (c3...).\n\nSo, the first N (position 1) is NH2 (since it's connected only to S and has two H's), then S=O=O connected to N (position 5), which is connected to C (position 6). Therefore, the structure is NH2-SO2-N-CH2-CH2... So the N (position 5) is attached to the SO2 and a CH2. That N would have two H's? Wait, no. The N (position 5) is connected to three atoms: S (position 2), C (position 6), and perhaps a hydrogen. So the valence would be three bonds: S, C, and H. Therefore, it's a secondary amine: NH attached to SO2 and CH2. So the group is NH2-SO2-NH-CH2... But that's a sulfamide group (SO2 between two amines), not a sulfonamide. A sulfonamide would have the SO2 connected to an amine and an R group. Here, it's between two amines. So that's a sulfamide, which is a different functional group.\n\nTherefore, there are no primary sulfonamide groups (-SO2NH2) in the input molecule. Both sulfur groups are either sulfamides or sulfones. Hence, the count is zero.",

Let me write out the SMILES and see. The molecule has several parts. The main ring seems to be a bicyclic system. Let's break it down. The main aromatic ring (c1) has various substituents: OCH3 (COc1...), a fluorine (F), an amino group (N), and a ketone group (=O).

The input molecule's SMILES is COc1ccccc1-c1ccc(CC(NC(=O)Cn2cnnn2)C(=O)O)cc1, and the fragment is given as -OMe with SMILES -OMe.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input molecule. Let's break down the SMILES. The molecule starts with COc1ccccc1-, which is a benzene ring (the 'c1ccccc1' part) attached to a methoxy group (CO-) and then connected via a single bond to another benzene ring (the '-c1ccc(...)cc1' part). The second benzene ring has a substituent: CC(NC(=O)Cn2cnnn2)C(=O)O. Let me visualize this.\n\nThe methoxy group is O-methyl, so in SMILES, that's CO- or OMe. The fragment SMILES here is -OMe, which implies that the oxygen is connected to a methyl group and that the oxygen is the point of attachment (since there's a hyphen before OMe). Wait, but in SMILES notation, the hyphen usually indicates a bond. So -OMe would mean that the OMe is attached via a single bond. But in the input molecule, the methoxy is written as COc1..., which is correct for a methoxy group (O connected to a methyl (C) and then to the aromatic ring.\n\nNow, the task is to find all instances where a methoxy group (-OCH3) is attached to the rest of the molecule. Let's look at the input SMILES again. The first part is COc1ccccc1. The CO here is the methoxy group attached to the benzene ring (c1ccccc1). That's one methoxy group.\n\nThen, the rest of the molecule is another benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1) with a substituent chain. Let's look at that substituent: CC(NC(=O)Cn2cnnn2)C(=O)O. Breaking that down: there's a central carbon (the first C in CC) connected to another carbon (the second C), which has a substituent: NC(=O)Cn2cnnn2. Then there's a C(=O)O group. So that part has a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O), but no methoxy groups here. The NC(=O)Cn2cnnn2 part includes an amide (NC=O) and a ring (n2cnnn2, which is a triazole or similar). No methoxy groups in this substituent either.\n\nSo the entire molecule has only one methoxy group, which is the CO attached to the first benzene ring.

The input molecule is O=C(CCCCCCc1ccccc1)c1ncc(-c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2)o1, and the fragment we're looking for is =N-O, which is an oxime group.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES of the input molecule. Breaking it down, there's a ketone group (O=C) connected to a long carbon chain (CCCCCCc1ccccc1), which is a benzene ring attached to a hexyl chain. Then there's another part: c1ncc(...)o1. This looks like an oxazole ring. The substituent on the oxazole is -c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2. Let me check that part. The [N+](=O)[O-] is a nitro group. So the substituent has a nitrobenzene ring attached to a pyridine (since there's 'ccn2', making a ring with two carbons and a nitrogen).\n\nNow, looking for the fragment =N-O. Oximes are typically R1R2C=N-OH. The SMILES given is =N-O, which implies a double bond between N and O. Wait, no. Oxime structure is C=N-OH. So the SMILES should be N-O with a double bond to the N. Wait, the fragment SMILES is written as =N-O. That would be a structure where N is double-bonded to something else and has an -O group attached. Let me visualize. If it's =N-O, maybe it's part of a nitro group? But nitro is [N+](=O)[O-]. Alternatively, maybe it's an imino group with an oxygen attached. Wait, oximes are C=N-OH. The SMILES for that would be N-O, but with the N double-bonded to the carbon. So maybe the fragment here is looking for the N-O group where the N is double-bonded to another atom (like in the nitro group). But the nitro group is [N+](=O)[O-], which has two oxygens attached. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is part of an oxime where the N is double-bonded to C and has an -O- group.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES: the nitro group is [N+](=O)[O-]. So that's a nitro group, not an oxime. The oxime would be C=N-O. Let me check the input molecule again. The structure is O=C(...) which is a ketone. Then the oxazole ring (c1ncc...o1) with a substituent that includes a pyridine ring (c2cc...n2) with a nitro group attached. So in the substituent -c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2, the nitro group is present. But the fragment we're looking for is =N-O. Wait, the nitro group has N connected to two O atoms (one double bond, one single with a negative charge). The fragment =N-O would be N double-bonded to something else and single-bonded to O. But in the nitro group, it's [N+](=O)[O-], so the N has two double bonds (one to O, and the charge indicates the structure). Therefore, the nitro group doesn't have a single N-O bond. So maybe the fragment here is part of an oxime. Let me check the input molecule again for any oxime groups. Oxime is C=N-OH. Looking at the SMILES: the nitro group is present, but is there any N-O single bond that's part of an oxime? Let's see. The input molecule has O=C(...), which is a ketone. The oxazole ring has an oxygen (o1), but that's part of the ring. The substituent on the oxazole is -c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2. The nitro group here is [N+](=O)[O-], which doesn't match the =N-O fragment. The fragment =N-O would be a nitroso group (N=O), but that's different. Wait, the fragment name is oximes. Oximes are C=N-OH. The SMILES for that would be C=N-O. But the fragment given here is =N-O. So maybe the SMILES is written as the N with a double bond and an O attached. But in the input molecule, is there any such group?\n\nLet me look again. The input molecule's SMILES: O=C(CCCCCCc1ccccc1)c1ncc(-c2cc([N+](=O)[O-])ccn2)o1. The nitro group is part of the substituent on the pyridine ring. The rest of the structure includes a ketone (O=C), the oxazole ring (ncc...o1), and the substituent. There's no obvious C=N-O group here. The nitro group has N connected to O via double bond and another O-, but that's not the same as =N-O. Therefore, the count of the fragment =N-O (oximes) in the input molecule should be zero. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The fragment is named oximes, which are typically C=N-OH. The SMILES given for the fragment is =N-O. If the oxime is C=N-OH, the SMILES would be C=N-O. But in the input molecule, is there any such group? Looking at the input, the nitro group is present, but that's different. The only nitrogen atoms are in the oxazole ring (n), the pyridine ring (n2), and the nitro group. The oxazole has a nitrogen, but it's part of the ring.

Let me parse the SMILES notation. Breaking it down, the molecule has several nitrogen atoms. The main chain includes an aromatic ring with nitrogens. Let's check each nitrogen to see if it's a primary amine.\n\nThe first part is Nc1... which is an amino group attached to a carbon in a ring. That's NH2 connected to the aromatic ring. Since it's -NH2 attached to a carbon, this is a primary amine. Next, there's another part: CNc3cc(N)ncn3. The CN here is a methylene group attached to a nitrogen. The nitrogen in CN is part of an amine. Wait, CN would be a nitrile if it's C\u2261N, but in this case, it's C-N. So the structure here is OCC(O)CN... The part after OCC(O) is CNc3... So the nitrogen here is connected to a carbon (from the C-O-C-O-C chain) and another carbon in the c3 ring. That nitrogen has two carbons attached and maybe a hydrogen? Wait, the SMILES is CNc3... so the nitrogen is connected to two carbons (the C from OCC(O)C and the c3). Since it's N with two substituents, that would make it a secondary amine, not primary. Because primary amines have NH2, which is two hydrogens and one carbon. So the CN part here is a secondary amine.\n\nThen, in the c3cc(N)ncn3 part, there's an N in the ring. The SMILES is cc(N)ncn3. So the N here is part of a ring. Let's see: the ring is c3cc(N)ncn3. The positions are: carbon, carbon with NH2 (the (N)), then a nitrogen (n), then carbon, another nitrogen (n), and back. The 'n' denotes a nitrogen in an aromatic ring, like in pyridine. The (N) indicates an amino group attached to the carbon. So the (N) here is NH2 attached to the carbon in the ring. That's another primary amine. So in the c3cc(N)ncn3 part, there's one NH2 group.\n\nSo counting all primary amines: the first N in Nc1... is one. Then in the c3cc(N)ncn3 part, the (N) is another. Are there any others? Let me check again. The molecule is Nc1cnc(...)cn1. The first N is at position c1, so that's NH2 attached to the aromatic ring. Then in the substituent chain: -c2ccc(C3CCC3)c(OCC(O)CNc3cc(N)ncn3)c2F. The OCC(O)CNc3... part: the CN is a methylene group attached to N, which is then connected to the c3 ring. The c3 ring has another NH2. So total primary amines are two? Let me confirm. The first N in the main ring (Nc1...), and the (N) in the c3cc(N)ncn3 part. Are there any other NH2 groups? Let's check the entire structure again. The main ring has Nc1, then another N in the substituent's ring (the (N)). Any other amino groups? The CN in OCC(O)CN... is a secondary amine. The other nitrogens in the rings (the 'n' in the aromatic rings) are part of the ring structure and not amines. So total count should be 2.",

The user wants to find out how many times the ester fragment (-COOR) appears in the input molecule CCCCOC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)C2(c3cccs3)CCOCC2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an ester group looks like. Esters are typically represented by the structure R-O-C(=O)-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. The SMILES notation for an ester is usually something like COOR, where the oxygen is connected to the carbonyl group (C=O) and another oxygen connected to an R group.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES: CCCCOC(=O)c1ccc(NC(=O)C2(c3cccs3)CCOCC2)cc1. Let me parse this step by step. Breaking it down, the main chain starts with CCCC (four carbons), followed by OC(=O), which is an ester group. The OC(=O) is connected to a benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1). The substituent on the benzene ring is NC(=O)C2(...)CCOCC2. \n\nSo, the first part after the four carbons is OC(=O), which is an ester group. The carbonyl here is attached to an oxygen connected to the CCCC chain. So that's one ester group.\n\nNow, looking further into the molecule. The substituent on the benzene ring is NC(=O)... Here, the C(=O) is part of an amide group (since it's attached to an N), so that's a carbonyl but not an ester. Then there's another part: C2(c3cccs3)CCOCC2. The CCOCC2 part looks like an ethylene glycol chain, maybe a cyclic structure? Wait, the C2 is part of a ring. The CCOCC2 would form a five-membered ring? Let me visualize. If C2 is connected to CCOC, that might form a ring like C2-C-C-O-C-C2, making a five-membered ring. But in any case, are there any ester groups here? The CCOCC part doesn't have a carbonyl. The other part is c3cccs3, which is a thiophene ring (sulfur in the ring), so no esters there.\n\nSo, the only ester group is the OC(=O) attached to the CCCC chain. Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The input molecule has OC(=O), which is O-C(=O)- connected to the benzene ring. The R group here is the CCCC (butyl group), and the other part is the benzene ring. So yes, that's an ester group: R-O-C(=O)-R', where R is butyl and R' is the aryl (benzene ring with substituents). So that's one ester.\n\nIs there another ester elsewhere? Let's check the substituent on the benzene ring again: NC(=O)C2(...). That's an amide (N attached to carbonyl), not an ester. The C2 part has CCOCC2, which is a cyclic ether or something else, but no carbonyl groups there. So no other esters.\n\nTherefore, the count is 1.",

The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings. Starting with CN1C2CCC1CC... there's a bicyclic system here. Then there's an oxygen connected to a benzene ring (Oc1ccc...). Looking at the part after the oxygen: Oc1ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc1. This part has a benzene ring (the 'c1ccc...cc1') where one of the carbons is substituted with a C(F)(F)F group.

Let's break it down. The molecule starts with COCCCNC(=O)... So, after the COCCC part, there's an NC(=O). That looks like an amide group: a carbonyl (C=O) attached to a nitrogen. The fragment given is -C(=O)N, which would mean the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, in the fragment SMILES, the order is C(=O)N, so the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl. In the molecule, the sequence is NC(=O), which is the same as -N-C(=O)-. But since SMILES is directional, does the order matter here? Let me think. The fragment is written as -C(=O)N. So the carbonyl is connected to the nitrogen. In the molecule, the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl. So that's the same group. So that's one occurrence.\n\nThen, looking further into the molecule: after the NC(=O), there's a c1c(C)nn(...)c1. The \"c\" here indicates aromatic carbons. So that part is a ring structure. The nn(...) suggests two nitrogens in the ring connected to something. Then there's another -n1cccc1, which is a five-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen and four carbons.\n\nSo, the main part where the amide fragment could be is the NC(=O) in the beginning. Are there any other occurrences? Let me check the rest of the molecule. The part after the first amide is a ring system. Are there any other C(=O)N groups? Let's see. The aromatic rings have nitrogens, but I don't see another carbonyl attached to a nitrogen. The fragment is specifically -C(=O)N, which means the carbonyl is directly connected to a nitrogen. The only place that happens is the NC(=O) in the COCCCNC(=O) part. So that's one instance.\n\nWait, the fragment SMILES is \"-C(=O)N\". The hyphen indicates that it's a part of a larger structure. So the carbonyl is connected to a nitrogen on one side, and possibly another group on the other. In the molecule, the NC(=O) is part of the chain: the nitrogen is connected to the previous carbon (from COCCCN), and the carbonyl is connected to the next aromatic ring. So that's exactly one occurrence of the fragment. There's no other place where a carbonyl is attached to a nitrogen in the molecule. The other nitrogens are in rings or connected to other groups but not as part of an amide linkage.\n\nTherefore, the count should be 1.",

The input molecule's SMILES is C=CCN1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)C(C(=O)Oc2c(OC)cccc2OC)C1.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the SMILES structure. Let's break it down. Starting from the left: C=C-C-N1-C-C-N(...). The part that catches my eye is the C(=O) group. That's a carbonyl group, which is either a ketone or aldehyde. Since the fragment is =O, but in the context of aldehydes or ketones, the actual group would be a carbonyl (C=O). However, the fragment SMILES given is just =O. Wait, but in SMILES notation, the double bond needs to be specified with adjacent atoms. So maybe the fragment is looking for any occurrence of an oxygen double-bonded to a carbon, regardless of the neighboring atoms.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, I need to check all the oxygen atoms. Let's go through each part. The main chain has C=CCN1CCN(...). Then there's a branch with C(C(=O)Oc2c(OC)cccc2OC). Here, the C(=O) is a carbonyl group (ketone or ester maybe). Then, there are two O-C groups: OC attached to the benzene ring. Each of those O's is in an ether or ester group, but not a carbonyl. So in the benzene ring part, there's O connected to C in OC, but that's an ether. \n\nThe key part is the C(=O) in the ester group. The structure is C(=O)Oc..., which is an ester. The carbonyl here is part of the ester functional group. So that's one occurrence of =O. Are there any others in the molecule? Let me check the rest. The other parts are the C=CCN... which is an alkene (C=C), not a carbonyl. The other substituents on the benzene ring are OCH3 groups (OC with another OCH3?), but those are ethers or methoxy groups, not carbonyls. \n\nWait, the SMILES is C(=O)Oc2c(OC)cccc2OC. Let me parse that again. The c2c(OC)cccc2OC part: the benzene ring (c2c...cccc2) has two OCH3 groups. The OC attached to the ring is a methoxy group. Then, the O in the ester is part of the O in C(=O)Oc... So the only =O is in the ester group. Therefore, the count should be 1. \n\nBut wait, the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\". The ester's carbonyl is a ketone derivative, but in an ester, it's technically a carbonyl but not a ketone. However, the fragment SMILES is =O, which would match any oxygen double-bonded to carbon. So regardless of whether it's an aldehyde, ketone, ester, or amide, the =O would count. But the fragment name specifies aldehydes or ketones. So maybe only the carbonyl groups that are part of aldehydes (RCHO) or ketones (RCOR') should be counted. In the given molecule, the C(=O) is part of an ester (COOR), so it's not a ketone or aldehyde. Therefore, perhaps the count is zero. But that contradicts the initial thought. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me check the actual structure. The ester group is O-C-O. The carbonyl is part of the ester. The question is, does the fragment name \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\" include esters? The fragment SMILES is =O, which would technically match any carbonyl. But the name specifies aldehydes or ketones, which are specific types of carbonyl-containing groups. So maybe the count should be based on whether the =O is part of an aldehyde or ketone. In the input molecule, the only =O is in the ester, which is neither an aldehyde nor a ketone. Therefore, the count would be zero. But this depends on the exact definition. Alternatively, if the fragment is defined purely by the SMILES =O, regardless of the context, then it's one. But the user provided the fragment name, so maybe they want to consider the functional group. So I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES given for the fragment is =O, which in SMILES notation is invalid because it's just a double bond without atoms. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the fragment SMILES is =O. But in SMILES syntax, a double bond must connect two atoms. So =O is not a valid SMILES. Oh, this is a mistake. The correct SMILES for a carbonyl group would be C=O. So maybe the user made a typo. But the fragment name is aldehydes or ketones, which are RCHO and RCOR', both of which have a carbonyl group (C=O). So perhaps the intended fragment is C=O. But the given SMILES is =O, which is invalid. However, perhaps the user intended the carbonyl oxygen, so any oxygen with a double bond. In that case, even if the SMILES is invalid, the count would be the number of carbonyl groups in the molecule. In the input molecule, there's one C(=O) group in the ester. So that's one. But if the fragment is only aldehydes or ketones, then esters (which have a carbonyl but are not aldehydes/ketones) would not count. So the count would be zero. But I need to resolve this ambiguity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the fragment to be O with a double bond, which in SMILES would be part of a carbonyl group. Since the input molecule has one C=O group (in the ester), but esters are not aldehydes or ketones. Therefore, the count would be zero. But this is conflicting. The correct answer depends on whether the user considers any carbonyl (regardless of functional group) or only aldehydes/ketones. Since the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\", the correct approach is to count only the aldehyde or ketone groups. The input molecule's structure: the ester has a carbonyl, but that's not a ketone or aldehyde. So count is zero. Wait, but the SMILES given for the fragment is =O, which is invalid, but if we consider the carbonyl group (C=O), then the count is one. However, the name specifies aldehydes or ketones, so maybe the user intended to count those. The molecule in question has C(=O) in an ester, which is a carbonyl but not a ketone. Therefore, count is zero. But this is a tricky point. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the fragment SMILES and intended C=O. In that case, the count would be one. But given the provided information, how should I proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fragment SMILES is incorrectly written as =O, but the intended fragment is a carbonyl group (C=O). If that's the case, then in the input molecule, there's one C=O in the ester. But since esters are not aldehydes or ketones, the count would be zero. However, if the fragment is just any occurrence of =O (which would include esters, amides, etc.), then count is one. But the fragment name is aldehydes or ketones. So the user probably wants to count only those. Therefore, the correct count is zero. But I need to check the molecule again. Let me look at the input SMILES again: C=CCN1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)C(C(=O)Oc2c(OC)cccc2OC)C1. The C(=O) is part of C(=O)Oc..., which is an ester (COO). Therefore, it's an ester carbonyl, not a ketone or aldehyde. Therefore, the count should be zero. But if the user is just counting any =O groups (despite the name), then it's one. But given the name, probably zero. But this is ambiguous. However, the fragment SMILES is =O, which is invalid. So perhaps the user intended C=O. If that's the case, then the count is one. Given that the user might have made a mistake, but the SMILES given is =O, which is invalid, but perhaps the intended fragment is any oxygen double-bonded to carbon (i.e., carbonyl groups), then the count is one. Since the user is asking for the number of fragments matching the SMILES, even if the SMILES is invalid, maybe we proceed under the assumption that they meant any C=O. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct approach is to parse the fragment SMILES as written. But =O is invalid. So perhaps this is an error, but the user intended to look for carbonyl groups, so the count is one.

The user wants me to count how many times the fragment SMILES =O (which represents a ketone or aldehyde group) appears in the input molecule.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the input molecule's structure. The SMILES given is CNc1ncnc(-c2cccnc2Oc2cc(C(=O)Nc3cccc(C(F)(F)F)c3)ccc2C)n1. Let me parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the left: CN is a methylamine group attached to a nitrogen. Then there's a ring structure (c1ncnc...). The part after the first ring is a substituent: -c2cccnc2Oc2cc(...). Here, there's an oxygen (O) connecting two aromatic rings. Wait, the O is part of an ether group here, maybe? Then in the next part: C(=O) which is a carbonyl group. That's a ketone if it's connected to two carbons. \n\nLooking at the substituent: C(=O)Nc3cccc(C(F)(F)F)c3. So the carbonyl is connected to an NH group (amide), which is attached to another benzene ring. The C(=O) here is a carbonyl in an amide, but wait, amides have the structure R-C(=O)-N. So in this case, the C=O is part of an amide group. However, the fragment specified is aldehydes or ketones. Aldehydes have R-C(=O)-H, and ketones have R-C(=O)-R'. Amides are different because the carbonyl is attached to an amine. Therefore, the C(=O) in the amide might not count as a ketone here.\n\nWait, the fragment name is \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\". So maybe the user is referring to carbonyl groups that are not part of amides, esters, etc. Let me check the SMILES again. The molecule has O in a few places. Let's list all the oxygen atoms and their contexts.\n\n1. The O in Oc2cc(...) is part of an ether group (connecting two aromatic rings), so that's an ether oxygen, not a carbonyl.\n2. The O in C(=O) is a carbonyl. But as part of an amide (C(=O)N...), so that's an amide carbonyl. The question is whether the fragment includes amide carbonyls. The fragment name is aldehydes or ketones. Typically, ketones are R2C=O, where the carbonyl is connected to two carbons. Aldehydes have R-C(=O)-H. But in the amide, the carbonyl is connected to a nitrogen. So according to standard definitions, the amide carbonyl wouldn't be considered a ketone. Therefore, this C(=O) in the amide group shouldn't be counted.\n\nAre there any other carbonyl groups in the molecule? Let's check the rest of the structure. The input SMILES is CNc1ncnc(-c2cccnc2Oc2cc(C(=O)Nc3cccc(C(F)(F)F)c3)ccc2C)n1. Breaking it down:\n\n- The main ring is a purine-like structure (ncnc...).\n- The substituent attached to the purine is a benzene ring (c2cccnc2) connected via an oxygen (O) to another benzene ring (c2cc(...)ccc2C). The second benzene has a substituent C(=O)N..., which is the amide group.\n\nLooking through the entire structure, the only occurrence of =O is in the amide group. There are no other carbonyl groups. The fragment is looking for aldehydes or ketones, which are not part of other functional groups like amides. Therefore, the count should be zero.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm. The fragment SMILES is =O, which technically matches any carbonyl group, but the fragment name specifies \"side-chain aldehydes or ketones\". So maybe the user wants to exclude carbonyls in amides, esters, etc. If that's the case, then the amide's carbonyl doesn't count. Hence, the count is 0. But if the fragment is just any =O group regardless of context, then there's one. But the name says aldehydes or ketones, which implies they're looking for those specific groups. So the correct count here is 0.",

A terminal aldehyde group is a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a hydrogen atom, meaning the structure is R-C(=O)-H. The SMILES given is -C(=O)H, which confirms that. The key here is that the aldehyde is terminal, so the carbonyl must be at the end of a chain, not part of a larger group like a ketone or amide.\n\nNow, looking at the input molecule's SMILES. Let's break it down step by step. Starting from the left: CC(=O)N1... The first part is a methyl group (C) connected to a carbonyl (C=O), which is then attached to a nitrogen (N1). This carbonyl is part of an acetamide group (CH3-C(=O)-N-), so that's an amide, not an aldehyde. Amides have the structure R-C(=O)-N, so that's not our fragment.\n\nNext, looking at the rest of the molecule. There's a sulfur part: S(=O)(=O)N3CCC(...)CC3.

The carbonyl here is part of an amide (connected to a nitrogen), so again, not an aldehyde.\n\nLooking further, the rest of the molecule has aromatic rings (like c2ccc...cc2 and c4ncccc4C), but no other carbonyl groups except those in amides or sulfonyl groups. The terminal aldehyde requires a -C(=O)H group. Let me check if any of the carbonyls have a hydrogen attached.\n\nIn the input SMILES, all the carbonyl groups (C=O) are either part of amides (C(=O)N) or the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which are not aldehydes. Aldehydes would have the carbonyl bonded to a hydrogen and another carbon (R-C(=O)-H), but here, the carbonyls are bonded to other atoms like nitrogen or oxygen in the sulfonyl group. \n\nTherefore, there are no instances of the terminal aldehyde (-C(=O)H) in the input molecule.

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to count the number of primary amine fragments in the given molecule. The fragment SMILES is -N, and the name is primary amines. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a primary amine is. A primary amine has the structure R-NH2, where the nitrogen is attached to one carbon group and two hydrogens. The SMILES given is -N, which I think represents the NH2 group attached to a carbon. Wait, actually, the SMILES notation for a primary amine would be -NH2. But the fragment provided is -N. Hmm, maybe they're considering the amine group where the nitrogen is connected to one R group and two hydrogens. But SMILES notation for that would be NH2 or -NH2. Wait, maybe the SMILES here is simplified. Let me check the input molecule's structure.\n\nThe input molecule's SMILES is Cc1cc(O)cc(C)c1CC(N)C(=O)N1Cc2ccccc2CC1C(=O)Nc1nn[nH]n1. Let's parse this. Breaking it down:\n\nStarting from the left: C (methyl group attached to a benzene ring?), then a benzene ring with substituents: positions 1 is methyl (Cc1...), position 3 is O (oxygen, maybe hydroxyl?), then another methyl at position 4. Then we have CC(N)... which is a ethyl group with an amine attached? So the part CC(N) would be CH2CH(NH2)... wait, the N here is NH2? Because in SMILES, N with two Hs would be written as NH2. Wait, in SMILES, the notation for an amine group is N. If it's NH2, then it's written as N with two implicit hydrogens. Wait, SMILES rules: Nitrogen in amines. For example, NH3 would be N, NH2- (as in primary amine) would be N with two Hs, but in the context of being connected to a carbon. Let me think. \n\nIn the input molecule, the part CC(N)C(=O)... So that's a carbon chain: CH2-CH(NH2)-C(=O)... So the N here is connected to the CH and two hydrogens, making it a primary amine. Because the nitrogen is attached to one carbon (from the CH group) and two hydrogens. So that's a primary amine. \n\nLooking further into the molecule: After the carbonyl group (C(=O)), there's N1Cc2ccccc2CC1C(=O)Nc1nn[nH]n1. The N here is part of a ring? Let's see: N1C... which is a ring. The N1 is connected to a carbon (C), which is part of another benzene ring (c2ccccc2), then CC1, making a cyclohexane ring? Not sure. Then another carbonyl group (C(=O)) connected to Nc1nn[nH]n1. The N here is connected to a carbon (the c1...), which is part of a tetrazole ring (nn[nH]n1). Wait, the part Nc1nn[nH]n1: the nitrogen is attached to the tetrazole ring. But in this case, the nitrogen in the Nc1... is part of the tetrazole ring? Or is it an amine attached to the tetrazole? Let me draw this out. \n\nThe part C(=O)Nc1nn[nH]n1: the carbonyl is connected to an NH group, which is connected to the tetrazole ring (c1nn[nH]n1). Wait, the SMILES for the tetrazole is c1nn[nH]n1. The 'c' indicates aromatic carbon. So the ring is five-membered: positions 1 is the carbon connected to the NH, then positions 2,3,4,5 are nitrogens. The [nH] suggests one of the nitrogens has a hydrogen. So the tetrazole ring has four nitrogens and one carbon. The N connected to the carbonyl is part of the amide group: C(=O)N-... So that's a secondary amine, because the nitrogen is connected to two carbons (the carbonyl carbon and the tetrazole carbon). Therefore, that's not a primary amine. \n\nSo in the input molecule, where are the primary amines? The first occurrence is in the CC(N) part: that's a primary amine. Then, are there others? Let me check again. The rest of the molecule: after the first carbonyl (C(=O)N1Cc2...), the N1 is part of a ring. The N1 is connected to a carbon (C), which is part of a benzene ring. Then CC1, so the ring is probably a cyclohexyl or similar. The N1 here is part of a ring structure. In ring systems, the valence must be considered. If N is in a ring with three bonds, then it might have a hydrogen. For example, in pyrrole, the nitrogen has two bonds in the ring and one hydrogen. But in this case, the N1 is connected to C (from the benzene) and two other carbons (from CC1). Wait, the SMILES is N1Cc2ccccc2CC1. The N1 is connected to C (the benzene ring's carbon), then another C (from Cc2...), and then CC1. So the ring is N-C-C-C... forming a ring. The valence here: N1 has three bonds (to C, C, and C?), which would make it a tertiary amine. But that's impossible because nitrogen can't have three bonds and still be neutral without a charge. Wait, maybe there's a hydrogen attached. If N1 is in a ring with three single bonds, then it would have a lone pair and possibly a hydrogen. For example, in piperidine, the nitrogen is NH. But in this case, the SMILES doesn't show a hydrogen. So maybe the N1 is part of an aromatic ring, like pyrrole, but that's not indicated with lowercase letters. The lowercase 'c' is for aromatic carbons, but the N is uppercase, which is aliphatic. Hmm, this part is a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, the N1 is part of a bicyclic structure. Let me parse it again: N1Cc2ccccc2CC1. So N1 is connected to a carbon (C), which is connected to c2 (aromatic carbon in a benzene ring: c2ccccc2). Then CC1: the next carbon is connected to another carbon, and back to N1. So the ring formed is N1-C-C(c2...)-C-C-N1. That's a five-membered ring? Wait, N1 is connected to C, which is connected to c2 (benzene), then C-C, then back to N1. Wait, that would make a four-membered ring? Because N1-C-C-C-N1? That's a four-membered ring, which is possible but strained. Alternatively, maybe the CC1 is part of a different structure. Maybe I'm misparsing the SMILES. Let me try again. \n\nThe SMILES after the first carbonyl is N1Cc2ccccc2CC1C(=O)Nc1nn[nH]n1. Breaking it down:\n\nN1C c2ccccc2 C C1 C(=O)N c1nn[nH]n1.\n\nSo, the N1 is connected to a carbon (C), which is connected to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2), then another carbon (C), then another carbon (C) connected back to N1. So the ring is N1-C-C-C-C1? That's a five-membered ring? Wait, N1-C (position 1), then that C is connected to the benzene ring (c2...), then the next C is connected to another C, which connects back to N1. So the ring is N1-C-C-C-C1? That's a five-membered ring? Wait, no. N1 is connected to C (let's call this C3), which is connected to the benzene ring (c2...) and then another C (C4), which is connected to C5, which connects back to N1. So the ring is N1-C3-C4-C5-N1? That's a four-membered ring? That seems unlikely. Maybe I'm getting the connections wrong. Alternatively, the C after the benzene is part of a chain leading back to N1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is N1C(c2ccccc2)CC1, which forms a ring. So N1 is connected to C, which is connected to the benzene ring (c2...) and then two more carbons (CC1), forming a four-membered ring: N1-C-CC1. That would be a four-membered ring: N-C-C-C. But that's a four-membered ring with nitrogen, which is possible but strained. However, regardless of the ring structure, the key point is whether the nitrogen in that ring is a primary amine. \n\nIn the ring structure, the nitrogen (N1) is connected to three carbons (the C from the benzene part, and the two Cs from the CC part). So that would make it a tertiary amine, which is not a primary amine. Therefore, that nitrogen is not part of a primary amine group. \n\nThen, the next part is C(=O)Nc1nn[nH]n1. The N here is connected to the carbonyl group and the tetrazole ring (c1nn[nH]n1). The nitrogen in the amide group (C(=O)N-) is part of an amide, which is a secondary amine because it's connected to two carbons (the carbonyl carbon and the tetrazole carbon). So that's not a primary amine. \n\nSo, in the entire molecule, the only primary amine is the one in the CC(N) part. Let's confirm that. The SMILES for that part is CC(N). So, the structure is CH2-CH(NH2)-... So the NH2 group is attached to the CH, making it a primary amine. \n\nTherefore, the count should be 1. \n\nWait, but the fragment SMILES given is -N. Wait, maybe the user is considering any amine group where the nitrogen is attached to the molecule. But the fragment name is primary amines, which should be -NH2. But the SMILES is written as -N. That might be a mistake. However, in SMILES notation, a primary amine (NH2-) would be written as N if the two hydrogens are implicit. Wait, in SMILES, an aliphatic amine like NH2CH2 would be written as NC. The nitrogen here has two implicit hydrogens. So, in the input molecule's CC(N) part, the N is connected to the CH and has two hydrogens, making it NH2. So the SMILES for that group is N with two hydrogens, which is a primary amine. \n\nTherefore, the fragment SMILES given is -N, which in this context represents the primary amine group. So the count is 1. \n\nAre there any other -N groups in the molecule that are primary amines? Let me check again. The other N in the amide groups are part of secondary amines (connected to two carbons), and the N in the tetrazole ring is part of a heterocycle and not an amine. The N in the ring (N1) is tertiary. So yes, only one primary amine.",

The main structure has a long carbon chain (CCCCCCN) attached to a complex ring system. Within the rings, there's a part written as -c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl. This indicates a benzene ring (c3c...cccc3) with two chlorine atoms attached. Specifically, the Cl atoms are in positions where the benzene ring has two substituents: one Cl is directly attached to the third carbon (c(Cl)), and another Cl is at the end of the ring (Cl). \n\nSo, breaking it down: each Cl in the SMILES represents a chlorine atom, which is a halogen. Let me count them. The SMILES has two instances of Cl: one in c(Cl) and another in c3Cl. Wait, looking again, the benzene ring part is written as c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl.

The input molecule's SMILES is CCOCn1oc(=O)c(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c1-c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the ethoxy group looks like. The SMILES for ethoxy is -OEt, which translates to -OCH2CH3. So, the fragment is an oxygen atom connected to an ethyl group (CH2CH3), and it's a substituent attached to another part of the molecule.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's structure, let's break down the SMILES. Starting from the beginning: CCOC... That part is C-C-O-C, which is an ethoxy group attached to something. The \"CCOC\" would be ethyl (CH2CH2) followed by oxygen and another carbon. Wait, no. Ethoxy is OCH2CH3. So in SMILES, O connected to CH2CH3 would be OCC. So the first part \"CCOC\" is actually ethoxy (OCC) attached to another carbon. Wait, let me parse the SMILES properly.\n\nThe SMILES is CCOCn1oc(=O)c(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c1-c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1. Let's split it into parts. The first four atoms are C-C-O-C. So that's ethyl (C-C) connected to an oxygen (O), which is connected to a carbon (C). That carbon is part of a ring. The \"n1oc(=O)...\" indicates a ring with nitrogen at position 1. So the ethoxy group here is the O connected to the ethyl (CCO-), which is attached to the nitrogen-containing ring.\n\nThen, later in the SMILES, there's another part: Oc2ccccc2O. That's a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) with two oxygen substituents. One O is attached at position 2 (Oc2...) and another O at the end (O). Wait, the SMILES is O c2ccccc2O, which would be a benzene ring with two oxygen groups. But the ethoxy fragment is -OCH2CH3. So if there's an O connected to a CH2CH3, that's ethoxy.\n\nLooking back at the input molecule, the first part is CCOC... which is O connected to CH2CH3 (ethyl), so that's one ethoxy group. Then, in the later part, there's an O connected to a benzene ring (Oc2ccccc2O). The other O is part of a hydroxyl group (since it's O without any carbon chain attached). But the ethoxy group requires an ethyl chain attached to the oxygen. So the first occurrence is the CCOC part. Are there any others?\n\nWait, let's parse the entire SMILES step by step. Starting from the beginning:\n\n1. CCOCn1oc(=O)c(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c1-c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first four atoms: C-C-O-C (positions 1-4). The third atom is O connected to C (position 4). The C (position 4) is part of a ring (n1...). So the O here is part of an ethoxy group (O-C-C), which is connected to the ring. So that's one ethoxy group.\n\nThen, the rest of the molecule: looking at the substituents. The part after the ring is -c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1. The substituent here is O connected to a benzene ring (Oc2ccccc2O). The benzene ring has two oxygen atoms: one as a substituent (O-) and another O at the end. The first O in Oc2ccccc2O is part of an O-C6H4-O group. But wait, the SMILES here is Oc2ccccc2O. That would be a benzene ring with two oxygen substituents. The first O is attached to the benzene (as in phenol), and the second O is also attached. However, the second O might be part of another group. Wait, the full substituent is O c2ccccc2O. Let me check: the SMILES for that part is (Oc2ccccc2O). So the benzene ring (c2ccc(F)cc2) is part of a substituent earlier, but in the later part, there's Oc2ccccc2O. Wait, no, the substituent after the ring is -c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1. The oxygen here is O connected to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) which is followed by another O. Wait, that might be O connected to the benzene, and another O at the end. Let me parse that correctly.\n\nThe fragment in question is Oc2ccccc2O. Breaking it down: O (oxygen) connected to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2), then another O. Wait, the SMILES is Oc2ccccc2O. So the benzene ring has two oxygen substituents: one at position 1 (the first O) and another at position 4 (since the numbering would start at the first O as position 1, then the next O is after the cc c cc, which would be position 4? Or maybe position 2? Wait, SMILES notation for aromatic rings is that the order in the string determines the positions. So in \"c2ccccc2\", the first c is position 1, then each subsequent c is adjacent. So Oc2ccccc2O would be O attached to position 1 of the benzene ring, then the next O is attached to position 4? Because after the first O, the next atoms are c (position 2), c (3), c (4), c (5), c (6), and then the second O is attached to position 6? Wait, no. Let me think again. The benzene ring is written as c2 (start), then c, c, c, c, c, then O. Wait, the full SMILES for that part is Oc2ccccc2O. The benzene ring is between the two O atoms. So the first O is attached to the first carbon of the ring (position 1), and the last O is attached to the sixth carbon (position 6). But that would make a benzene ring with two oxygen substituents at positions 1 and 6. However, oxygen in SMILES is written as O, so that would be two hydroxyl groups? Or maybe one is an ether? Wait, no. If it's Oc2ccccc2O, that's O-c1ccccc1-O? Wait, maybe that's a typo, but in any case, those O's are attached to the benzene ring. But ethoxy is O connected to ethyl (CH2CH3). So unless there's an O connected to an ethyl group elsewhere, those O's on the benzene ring aren't ethoxy.\n\nSo the only ethoxy group is the first part: CCOC... which is O connected to ethyl (CCO-). Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The input molecule's SMILES starts with CCOCn1... So that's ethyl (CC) connected to O, then connected to C (which is part of a ring with n1). So the O is connected to ethyl (CH2CH3) and then to the ring. So that's definitely an ethoxy group (-OEt).\n\nIs there another occurrence? Let's look further. The rest of the molecule has another O in the substituent: -c1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2O)n1. The part here is O connected to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2O). The O here is part of a benzyloxy group or something else. Wait, the substituent is Oc2ccccc2O. So that's a benzene ring with two oxygen substituents. One is O- (as in a hydroxyl or ether), and the other O at the end. But unless one of those O's is connected to an ethyl group, it's not ethoxy. The SMILES here is Oc2ccccc2O. The first O is attached to the benzene, and the second O is attached where? Wait, the SMILES is O c2 c c c c c 2 O. So the benzene ring (c2...) is between the two O's. The first O is attached to position 1, and the second O is attached to position 6 of the benzene ring. But those are just two oxygen atoms attached to the benzene. If they are hydroxyl groups, then that's two -OH groups. But ethoxy is -OCH2CH3. So unless there's an ethyl group attached to an oxygen in this part, it's not ethoxy.\n\nLooking at the substituent: Oc2ccccc2O. The second O is at the end. How is that connected? Maybe it's part of a methoxy group or something else. Wait, the full SMILES for the substituent is Oc2ccccc2O. So after the benzene ring (c2ccccc2), there's an O. But in SMILES notation, the O would be attached to the previous atom, which is the benzene ring's last carbon. So the benzene has two O's: one at the first carbon (position 1) and one at the sixth (position 6). Both are -O groups. If they are -O- (ether) or -OH (hydroxyl), but without any alkyl chain attached, they aren't ethoxy. So in this part, there's no ethyl group attached to oxygen, so those are not ethoxy groups.\n\nTherefore, the only ethoxy group is the one at the beginning: CCOC..., making the count 1.",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the part after the amide NC: C1CCN(...)CC1OC. So that's a cyclohexane ring (1CCN...CC1) with an oxygen-containing group (OC).

Hmm, maybe that's a typo or maybe they're considering just the nitrogen part. But nitrile is a cyanide group, which is a carbon triple-bonded to nitrogen. So the correct SMILES for a nitrile is C#N.\n\nLooking at the input molecule: CN(C)CCCn1c(N)c(-c2nc3ccccc3s2)c2nc(C#N)c(C#N)nc21. Let me parse this. Breaking it down:\n\nThe main structure seems to be a bicyclic system. Let's start from the left: CN(C)CCCn1... So that's a dimethylamine (CN(C)) connected to a propyl chain (CCC), then a nitrogen (n) in a ring (1...). Then there's a c(N), which is an aromatic carbon attached to an NH group. Then another carbon connected to a substituent: -c2nc3ccccc3s2. That substituent is a thiophene ring (s2) fused with another ring? Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring connected to a sulfur. Let me not get too bogged down here. The key part is looking for C#N groups.\n\nLooking further in the molecule: c2nc(C#N)c(C#N)nc21. Here, there's a ring (positions 1 and 2). The 'c2nc(C#N)' part: the nitrogen is connected to a carbon with a nitrile group (C#N). Then another 'c(C#N)', so another nitrile. So in that ring, there are two C#N groups attached.

The substituent -c2nc3ccccc3s2: the 'nc3' here is part of a ring, but that's an aromatic nitrogen connected to a benzene ring and sulfur. No nitriles there.

The benzene ring has a substituent at position 4 (from the c1ccc(...) part), which is another benzene ring (the -c2ccc... part). The second benzene ring has a substituent that includes C=C3SC(=O)NC3=O. Let me visualize this structure.\n\nThe fragment we're looking for is -C(=O)OMe, which is a methyl ester group. The SMILES for the fragment is -C(=O)OMe, which translates to a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to an oxygen-methyl group (OMe). So, the ester group is O-C-O connected to a methyl.\n\nLooking back at the input molecule, the main part starts with COC(=O), which is a methyl ester group. That's one occurrence.

The input molecule has a structure that starts with CC(=O)N... which is an acetyl group attached to a nitrogen. Then there's a C(C) group, followed by a benzyl ring with some substituents. The fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. Wait, but the fragment's SMILES is written as -NC(=O)CH3. That implies the nitrogen is connected to something else (the hyphen at the start). So the actual group is the acetamide group: the nitrogen connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and then a methyl group (CH3).\n\nLooking at the input molecule, the beginning is CC(=O)NC(C)C... So the first part is CC(=O)-N-C(C)-... The nitrogen here is connected to the acetyl (CO) group and a C(C) which is a propyl group (since it's C connected to two CH3 groups? Wait, the SMILES here is NC(C)Cc... So the nitrogen is connected to the COCH3 group (from CC(=O)N), then to a C(C), which is a CH(CH3) group? Wait, the SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)Cc... So after the N, there's a C(C) which is a carbon attached to another carbon (maybe a CH2 group?), but the exact structure might need to be parsed carefully.\n\nBut the fragment is looking for the group where the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl (O=C-) and a methyl group (CH3). In the input molecule, the first part is CC(=O)N... So the acetyl group (COCH3) is attached to the nitrogen. Then the nitrogen is connected to C(C) which is a CH(CH3) group. So the structure here is NC(=O)CH3? Wait, the fragment's SMILES is -NC(=O)CH3. So the nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl (C=O) and a methyl (CH3). So in the input molecule, the part CC(=O)N... is acetyl attached to N. The nitrogen then has another substituent (C(C)), which is a branching point. So the N here is connected to the COCH3 (from CC(=O)) and then to the C(C) group. But in the fragment, the N is only connected to COCH3 and maybe another substituent (the hyphen indicates a bond to something else). So in the input molecule, the N has three substituents: the COCH3, the C(C), and possibly another hydrogen? Wait, in SMILES notation, the valence matters. Nitrogen typically has a valence of 3. So in the input molecule's SMILES, the N is connected to three groups: the COCH3 (from CC(=O)), the C(C) (which is a CH(CH3) group?), and another C (from the Cc1... part). Wait, the SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)Cc1... So breaking it down: the N is connected to three carbons. The first is the C from CC(=O), then the C(C) (which is a carbon connected to another C?), then the C from Cc1. Wait, maybe the structure is N-C(C)-C... So the nitrogen is connected to three carbons: the acetyl (C=O) group, a C that's part of a branch (C(C)), and another carbon (the C in Cc1...). \n\nBut the fragment is -NC(=O)CH3. So the N is connected to the COCH3 group and another substituent (the hyphen). So in the input molecule, does the N have exactly the COCH3 group and then two other substituents (like two carbons)? If so, then the fragment would match once here. But wait, the fragment is looking for N connected to COCH3 and possibly another group. So in the input molecule, the N is connected to COCH3, C(C), and another C (from Cc1...). So the N has three substituents: COCH3, C(C), and Cc1... So the fragment here is part of the structure, but the N has more substituents than just COCH3 and another group. Wait, but the fragment's SMILES is written as -NC(=O)CH3. The hyphen indicates a single bond to something else. So the fragment is the group where the N is attached to COCH3 and another substituent (the hyphen). So in the input molecule, the N has COCH3 and two other groups (C(C) and Cc1...). Therefore, the fragment would match once here because the N has COCH3 and another substituent. However, the fragment is specifically -NC(=O)CH3, which would imply that the N is part of an amide group, where it's connected to the carbonyl and a methyl, and another substituent. In the input molecule, the N is indeed connected to the acetyl group (COCH3), a CH(CH3) (from C(C)), and a CH2 (from Cc1...). So the N here is part of the amide group, but it's a secondary amide because it has two other substituents besides the acetyl. But the fragment is looking for the presence of the NC(=O)CH3 group regardless of other substituents. So the count would be 1 because there's only one such group in the molecule. \n\nLooking further into the molecule, after the Cc1ccc..., there's a C#C (triple bond) and another ring. But in that part, there's an OCc3cnco3 group. That part has an oxygen connected to a CH2 group, which connects to a cyano (cn) and an o (oxygen?) but that's part of a ring.

So in the input, the acetamide group is CH3-C(=O)-N-... whereas the fragment is N-C(=O)-CH3. Are these the same? Because in amides, the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl carbon. Wait, acetamide is CH3CONH2. So in the input molecule, the group is CH3-C(=O)-NH- (attached to the ring). The fragment is written as -NC(=O)CH3. So the nitrogen is attached to the carbonyl carbon, followed by CH3. That would be NH-CO-CH3? But that's the same as the acetamide group. Wait, maybe the order in the SMILES doesn't matter because it's the same group. Let me check.\n\nSMILES notation is directional, but the actual structure is the same regardless of the direction. For example, NC(=O)CH3 is the same as CH3C(=O)N- in terms of connectivity. Wait, no. If the fragment is written as NC(=O)CH3, that's N connected to C(=O), which is connected to CH3. So the nitrogen is directly attached to the carbonyl carbon. In the input molecule's SMILES, the part is CC(=O)N..., which is CH3-C(=O)-N... So the carbonyl is between CH3 and N. So that's the same as the fragment. Wait, but the fragment's SMILES is written as -NC(=O)CH3, which would imply that the nitrogen is connected to the rest of the molecule, then the carbonyl, then the methyl. So in the input, the acetamide group is CH3-C(=O)-N-... which would be the same as the fragment if the fragment is considered as a substituent. Wait, maybe the fragment is written as a substituent, so the nitrogen is the connecting point. So in the input molecule, the acetamide group is attached via the nitrogen. Let me visualize both.\n\nFragment: -N-C(=O)-CH3. So the nitrogen is connected to the main structure, followed by the carbonyl and methyl. In the input molecule, the group is CH3-C(=O)-N-... attached to the ring. So that's the same structure. Because the acetamide group is CH3-C(=O)-N-R, which is equivalent to R-N-C(=O)-CH3. So the order in SMILES might be different, but the actual structure is the same. So the fragment is present once in the input molecule. Let me check the input SMILES again.\n\nInput SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ncc2cc(-c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)c(=O)n(C)c2n1. Breaking this down:\n\n- The first part is CC(=O)N: which is CH3-C(=O)-NH- (the N is connected to the next part, which is a ring: c1ncc2...). So the acetamide group (CH3-C(=O)-NH-) is attached to the nitrogen of the ring. Then, in the ring, there's another carbonyl group: c(=O)n(C). That's a carbonyl attached to a nitrogen which is methylated (n(C)). So that's another amide group, but it's N-methylated. So the other amide is part of the ring structure, but with a methyl on the nitrogen (n(C)), which would be N-methyl carbamate or similar. \n\nSo the acetamide group (CC(=O)N) is present once. The other amide group is part of the ring but with a methyl on the nitrogen, so that's N-methyl, which would be a different fragment. Therefore, the fragment -NC(=O)CH3 (which is acetamide) is present once in the molecule. The methyl amide fragment is the acetamide group here. So the count should be 1.",

The input molecule's SMILES is COc1cc2ncnc(Nc3cccc(Br)c3)c2cc1OCCC(=O)NO.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the SMILES structure correctly. Let me break it down. Starting with COc1cc2ncnc(...)c2cc1OCCC(=O)NO. The CO at the beginning is a methoxy group (OCH3), so that's an oxygen but part of a methoxy, not a hydroxyl. Then there's a benzene ring (c1cc2...). The part after the benzene is OCCC(=O)NO. Let's look at that part: O connected to C-C-C(=O)-N-O. \n\nThe O in OCCC is an ether oxygen if connected between two carbons. Wait, O connected to three Cs? Wait, the structure is OCCC(=O)NO. So the chain is O-C-C-C(=O)-N-O. The first O is an ether oxygen (since it's connected to C-C-...), but the last part is NO. That would be a nitro group (O-N=O), but here it's written as (=O)NO. Wait, let me visualize: the C(=O)NO group. The C is double-bonded to O, then connected to N-O. That's a nitrosyl group attached to a carbonyl? Hmm, maybe the correct structure is a nitro group. Alternatively, the SMILES might be C(=O)NO, which could be a nitrate group: O-N-O connected to the carbonyl. So, the O in the nitrate would be part of the nitro or nitrate group.\n\nThe fragment in question is \"-O\", which refers to hydroxyl groups (-OH). But sometimes, people might refer to ether oxygens or other oxygen-containing groups. However, the fragment name here is \"side-chain hydroxyls\", which implies -OH groups in the side chains. So, hydroxyls (-OH) that are not part of aromatic rings, esters, nitro groups, etc.\n\nLooking at the input molecule's SMILES: \n\n- The methoxy group (CO-) has an oxygen, but it's part of an ether (OCH3), not a hydroxyl.\n- The oxygen in the OCCC part: the first O is part of an ether (O connected to two carbons: the benzene ring and the adjacent C in the chain). So that's an ether oxygen, not a hydroxyl.\n- Then the chain is O-C-C-C(=O)-N-O. The C(=O) is a carbonyl (ketone or ester?), then connected to N-O. The N-O here is part of a nitro group (O-N=O), but the SMILES is written as (=O)NO. Wait, the correct SMILES for a nitro group is [O-][N+](=O), but here it's written as (=O)NO. That might actually be a nitrate ester group: O-NO2. Let me parse that part again. The SMILES is OCCC(=O)NO. So after the carbonyl (=O), we have NO. So the structure would be: the carbonyl is connected to an N, which is connected to an O. But that might not be a standard group. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrooxy group: O-NO2. Wait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the C(=O) is connected to an O-N-O group. But that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, the SMILES could be OCCC(=O)NO, which would be O-C-C-C(=O)-N-O. The last O here is an oxygen connected to N, which might be part of a nitro or another group. However, in any case, the hydroxyls (-OH) would have to be explicit as O with an H attached. \n\nLooking for -OH groups in the SMILES: the input molecule's SMILES doesn't have any explicit -OH groups. All oxygens are part of ethers (like methoxy), carbonyl groups (C=O), or nitro/nitrate-like groups. The fragment SMILES given is \"-O\", which might be ambiguous. But since the fragment name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\", it's likely referring to -OH groups. Since there are no -OH groups in the input molecule, the count should be zero. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake in the fragment SMILES. Let me double-check. The fragment SMILES is \"-O\", which could be a hydroxyl group (-OH) or an ether (-O-). But the name is \"side-chain hydroxyls\", so it's -OH. The input molecule doesn't have any -OH groups. The only oxygen in a side chain is the O in OCCC, but that's an ether oxygen (as part of an ether linkage, not a hydroxyl). The carbonyl oxygen is part of a ketone or ester. The NO at the end could be a nitro group, which doesn't have hydroxyls. Therefore, the count of side-chain hydroxyls (-OH) is zero.",

The molecule starts with a nitrile group (N#C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1). The benzene ring has an oxygen atom connected to another benzene ring (Oc2ccc...cc2). \n\nLooking at the second benzene ring (c2), there's an amino group (NH) attached to a carbonyl (C=O) group.

Let me break it down to understand the structure. \n\nStarting with CCOC(=O)N... That's ethyl (CCO-) linked to a carbonyl group (C=O), then an amide (N connected to the next part). The main ring structure is a pyrimidine or similar heterocycle (c1ncc...c(N)n1). Attached to the oxygen in the ring (Oc2...) is another benzene ring (c2cc...cc2). Let's look at the substituents on this benzene ring: there's an iodine (I), an OCH3 (methoxy group, from OC), and a C(C)C which is a tert-butyl group.\n\nWait, the fragment in question is ethoxy (-OEt), which is O linked to an ethyl group (CCO-). Let me check the input molecule for any ethoxy groups.\n\nLooking at the SMILES again: The main chain starts with CCO, which is ethyloxy (ethoxy) attached to the carbonyl. So CCOC(=O) would be ethyl ester, so that's one ethoxy group here. Then, in the benzene ring substituents: there's an OC, which is OCH3 (methoxy), not ethoxy. But wait, in the part Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C, the OC is attached to the benzene ring. The OC here would be O-C, but the next atom is C connected to another C? Wait, the SMILES is Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C. Let me parse that benzene ring (c2...cc2). The substituents are: O- (from Oc2...), then I, then O-C (OC), then the tert-butyl (C(C)C). The OC here is O-C, but the C is part of the methoxy group (OCH3) or something else? Wait, the SMILES for the fragment is CCO, which is ethyl. So ethoxy would be O-C-C. So looking at the molecule, any oxygen connected to an ethyl group?\n\nThe first part is CCOC(=O)... which is O connected to ethyl (C-C-O), so that's one ethoxy. Then, in the benzene ring, the substituent is OC. If that's OC followed by another C in the ring, maybe that's O-C-... but let me check. The benzene ring part is Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C. The OC is a substituent on the benzene ring. So the O is connected to a C, which is part of the ring? Wait, no. The benzene ring is c2cc(I)c(OC)cc2. So the substituents are: at position 1 (since Oc2 is the first atom), then position 2 is c (part of the ring), position 3 is c(I), position 4 is c(OC), etc. So the OC here is O connected to a carbon. But what's the structure of that? The OC would be O-C, but if that's a methoxy group, the SMILES would be O-C(-C) something. Wait, perhaps the OC is part of a methoxy group (OCH3), but in the input molecule's SMILES, after OC, the next part is cc2C(C)C. So maybe the OC is O-C connected to the next C in the ring? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me parse the benzene ring step by step:\n\nThe benzene ring is written as Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C. Breaking it down:\n\n- The ring starts with O (oxygen) attached to c2 (the first carbon of the benzene ring).\n- Then, we have cc(I): two carbons in the ring, the third has an I substituent.\n- Then c(OC): the fourth carbon has an OC substituent. So O connected to a C. But that C is part of what? Since after OC comes cc2C(C)C, the OC is followed by another c (carbon in the ring), so the substituent here is O-C. But O-C without any other substituents would be a hydroxyl group, but that's not the case. Wait, perhaps the OC here is part of a methoxy group. Methoxy is O-C- with three Hs. But in SMILES, if it's O-C connected to another carbon (like methyl), it would be written as O-C(-C). Wait, in the input SMILES, after OC comes cc2C(C)C. So the OC substituent is O connected to a C, which is then connected to the next carbon in the ring. But that would form a bond, which isn't possible. Wait, maybe I'm misparsing the SMILES. Let me try again.\n\nThe full SMILES is: CCOC(=O)Nc1ncc(Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C)c(N)n1.\n\nBreaking down the parts:\n\n- CCOC(=O)N... : Ethyl (C-C-O) ester group connected to a carbonyl (C=O), then an amide (N connected to the next part).\n- c1ncc(...)c(N)n1: A ring, likely a pyrimidine (two nitrogens). The positions here: the O is attached to the c in the ring (Oc2...).\n- Oc2cc(I)c(OC)cc2C(C)C: The oxygen is connected to the benzene ring (c2...cc2). The substituents on the benzene are:\n  - At position 1: O (from Oc2)\n  - Position 2: c (ring)\n  - Position 3: c with I (I substituent)\n  - Position 4: c with OC substituent\n  - Position 5: c (ring)\n  - Position 6: c connected to C(C)C (tert-butyl)\n  \nSo the substituent at position 4 is OC. Wait, OC in SMILES would be O connected to a carbon, which is then connected to another carbon (from the next c in the SMILES string). But that would mean that the O is connected to a carbon that's part of the ring? That can't be. Oh, wait, no. The OC is a substituent on the benzene ring. So the carbon in the ring (position 4) has an O-C group attached. But the C in OC would need to have other bonds. If it's OC with no other atoms, that would be a hydroxyl group (O-), but that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps there's a typo or I'm misreading. Let's look again: the substituent is c(OC), which in SMILES means a carbon (in the ring) with a substituent of O-C. But the C in O-C must be connected to something else. However, in the given SMILES, after OC comes cc2C(C)C. So the OC is followed by another c (ring carbon). That would imply that the O-C is connected to the next carbon in the ring, which would form a bond, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the OC is part of a methoxy group (OCH3), but the SMILES for methoxy is O-C. But then where are the Hs? In SMILES, if it's O-C with three Hs, it's written as OC. Wait, no. Methoxy is O-C- with three Hs, which in SMILES is written as O-C. But in that case, the C would have three Hs. But in the given SMILES, the substituent is c(OC), meaning that the benzene carbon is connected to an O, which is connected to a C. But that C must have three more bonds. If it's O-C connected to three Hs, that's a methoxy group. But in SMILES, methoxy is O-C, but the C would have to have three Hs implicitly. So perhaps the OC here is a methoxy group (OCH3). But the fragment in question is ethoxy (OCH2CH3). So the OC substituent here is methoxy, not ethoxy. Therefore, in the input molecule, the only ethoxy group is the initial CCO (ethyl) attached to the carbonyl as an ester group. \n\nAdditionally, looking at the rest of the molecule, is there another ethoxy group? Let me check again. The main chain starts with CCOC(=O), so that's ethoxy. Then, in the benzene ring substituent, there's an OC (methoxy) and a tert-butyl. So the only ethoxy is the first part. Therefore, the count should be 1.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me confirm. The fragment SMILES given is -OEt, which is ethoxy. The SMILES for ethoxy is CCO. So in the input molecule, the CCO group is part of the ester: CCOC(=O). That's indeed an ethoxy group attached via the oxygen to the carbonyl. So that's one occurrence. Are there any other CCO groups in the molecule? Let me check the rest. The benzene ring has O connected to the pyrimidine ring, then the substituents: I, OC (methoxy), and tert-butyl. No other ethyl (C-C-O) groups. Therefore, the count is 1.",
