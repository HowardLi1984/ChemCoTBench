        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine if Molecule A and Molecule B are the same based on their SMILES strings. \n\nFirst, I'll look at Molecule A: CCc1ccc(OC(C)=O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C)cc2)c1. Breaking this down, the main structure is a benzene ring (the 'c1ccc...c1' part). Attached to the ring are several substituents. Starting from the first carbon (position 1?), there's an ethyl group (CC-), then at position 4 (since the ring is usually numbered in a way that substituents get the lowest possible numbers), there's an OC(C)=O group, which is an acetyloxy group. Then at position 3 (maybe?), there's a ketone group (C(=O)) connected to another benzene ring. The second benzene ring (c2ccc(C)cc2) has a methyl group (C) attached.\n\nNow, Molecule B: c1c(ccc(c1)C(=O)c1cc(CC)ccc1OC(C)=O)C. Let's parse this. The main ring is again a benzene ring. The substituents here are a bit different. The first part is c1c(...)C, so there's a methyl group attached. Then inside the parentheses, we have ccc(c1)C(=O)... So maybe the substituents are at different positions. The C(=O) group is attached to another benzene ring (c1cc(CC)ccc1OC(C)=O). This second ring has an ethyl group (CC) in position 3 (cc(CC)ccc), and an OC(C)=O group in position 4. \n\nWait, the key here is to check if the connectivity and substituents are the same, just possibly in different positions due to SMILES notation. SMILES can represent the same molecule with different atom orderings, so I need to canonicalize them or compare their structures.\n\nMolecule A has a main benzene ring with substituents: ethyl, acetyloxy, and a ketone-linked benzene with methyl. Molecule B's main ring has substituents: methyl, ketone-linked benzene (which has ethyl and acetyloxy). Wait, maybe the main ring in B is the same as the substituent ring in A? Or is it the other way around?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two SMILES are just different representations of the same structure. Let me try to draw them mentally. \n\nIn Molecule A, the main benzene has ethyl (CC-), then acetyloxy (OC(=O)C), and a ketone (C(=O)) connected to another benzene that has a methyl. \n\nIn Molecule B, the main benzene has a methyl (C), a ketone (C(=O)) connected to another benzene. This second benzene has ethyl (CC) and acetyloxy (OC(=O)C). \n\nSo, if you look, both molecules consist of two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. One benzene has ethyl and acetyloxy, the other has a methyl. But wait, in Molecule A, the ethyl is on the main benzene, and the methyl is on the substituent benzene. In Molecule B, the main benzene has a methyl, and the substituent benzene has ethyl and acetyloxy. \n\nBut wait, the substituent benzene in A has a methyl (C) at position 4 (since c2ccc(C)cc2 would place the methyl at position 4). In Molecule B's substituent benzene, it's c1cc(CC)ccc1OC(C)=O. The CC (ethyl) is at position 3 (since after the first two carbons, the CC is in position 3), and the OC(C)=O is at position 4. So the substituent benzene in B has ethyl at 3 and acetyloxy at 4, whereas in A, the substituent benzene has methyl at 4. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the structures again.\n\nMolecule A: main ring is CCc1ccc(OC(=O)C)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C)cc2)c1. So the main benzene has:\n\n- At position 1 (assuming the starting point is the CC group), an ethyl group (CC attached to the ring).\n- Then positions 2,3,4: the next groups. Wait, SMILES notation builds the ring in order. Let's parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nFor Molecule A: CCc1ccc(OC(=O)C)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C)cc2)c1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CC: ethyl group\n- c1: start of benzene ring. The ethyl is attached to the first carbon of the ring.\n- Then ccc: three more carbons in the ring. The fourth carbon (since we have c1ccc(...) ) would have the OC(=O)C group (acetyloxy).\n- Then the next carbon (position 5) has the C(=O) group attached to another benzene ring (c2ccc(C)cc2). The substituent benzene ring (c2ccc(C)cc2) has a methyl group at position 4 (since the substituent is in the fourth position of the c2 ring).\n- Then back to the main ring's sixth carbon (c1), closing the ring.\n\nSo the main benzene has ethyl (position 1), acetyloxy (position 4), and the ketone-linked benzene (position 5). The substituent benzene (from the ketone) has methyl at position 4.\n\nNow Molecule B: c1c(ccc(c1)C(=O)c1cc(CC)ccc1OC(C)=O)C.\n\nBreaking down Molecule B:\n\n- c1: start of benzene ring.\n- c(...)C: the first carbon has a substituent (inside the parentheses) and the second carbon has a methyl (C). Wait, the SMILES is c1c(ccc(c1)...)C. Let me parse this carefully.\n\nThe main ring is c1c(...)C(...) where the first part is:\n\nc1c(ccc(c1)...)C(...). So the main ring starts at position 1, then position 2 has a group. The group in parentheses is ccc(c1), which is a chain: c-c-c, then a connection back to c1 (position 1 of the main ring). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's try to build it step by step.\n\nThe SMILES for B: c1c(ccc(c1)C(=O)c1cc(CC)ccc1OC(C)=O)C.\n\nStarting with the main benzene ring:\n\n1. c1: start of ring 1.\n2. The next character is c, which is the second atom in the ring.\n3. The second atom (atom 2) has a branch: (ccc(c1)...). Let's parse the branch:\n   - c: start a new chain.\n   - c: another carbon (atom 3 in the branch).\n   - c: another carbon (atom 4 in the branch).\n   - (c1): connect back to atom 1 of ring 1. So this creates a ring closure, forming a benzene ring? Wait, no. Because the main ring is already c1, and this branch is part of the main ring. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's consider that the main ring is c1, then the structure is c1c(...)C. The part in the parentheses is a chain connected to atom 2 of the main ring. The chain is ccc(c1), which would form a bridge? Or maybe it's part of the main ring. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is written in a way that creates the main benzene ring with substituents. Let's try a different approach. Maybe using a SMILES parser would help, but since I can't do that, I'll have to visualize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for Molecule B is better written as:\n\nc1c(ccc(c1)C(=O)c2cc(CC)ccc2OC(C)=O)C\n\nBut the original input has c1 repeated, which might be causing confusion. Wait, the SMILES for B is: c1c(ccc(c1)C(=O)c1cc(CC)ccc1OC(C)=O)C. Wait, the same ring identifier (c1) is used again inside, which is not allowed in SMILES notation. Each ring must have unique identifiers. So this might be a typo. If the user intended to use different identifiers, like c1 and c2, then the SMILES would be valid. But as written, the SMILES for B reuses c1, which would be invalid. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the input. However, assuming that it's a typo and the user meant to use different identifiers, let's try to correct it.\n\nAssuming the correct SMILES for B is: c1c(ccc(c1)C(=O)c2cc(CC)ccc2OC(C)=O)C\n\nNow, parsing this:\n\nMain ring (c1) has:\n\n- Atom 1: part of the benzene.\n- Atom 2: connected to a substituent, which is the branch in the parentheses: ccc(c1)C(=O)c2cc(CC)ccc2OC(C)=O.\nWait, that's still complex. Let's break it down.\n\nMain ring (c1):\n\n- Atom 1: connected to atom 2 (c1c...).\n- Atom 2 has a substituent: (ccc(c1)C(=O)c2cc(CC)ccc2OC(C)=O).\n\nThe substituent chain starts with ccc(c1), which connects back to atom 1 of the main ring, forming a ring closure. Wait, but that would create a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a chain of three carbons connected back to the main ring's atom 1. But that's not possible without forming a fused ring. This suggests that the SMILES might be malformed. Alternatively, perhaps the original SMILES for B is incorrect, leading to confusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES is intended to represent a benzene ring with substituents. Let's try again, considering possible corrections.\n\nAssuming that the user made a mistake with the ring closures and the correct SMILES for B is:\n\nc1c(ccc(c1)C(=O)c2cc(CC)ccc2OC(=O)C)C\n\nBut I'm not sure. This is getting too confusing. Maybe the key is to recognize that despite different SMILES strings, the two molecules might be the same due to symmetry or different starting points in the SMILES notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two molecules are structural isomers but not the same. For example, the positions of substituents on the benzene rings might differ. \n\nIn Molecule A, the main benzene has ethyl at position 1, acetyloxy at position 4, and the ketone-linked benzene (with methyl at position 4) at position 5. \n\nIn Molecule B, the main benzene has a methyl at position 2 (since the main ring starts with c1c(...)C, where the C is a methyl at position 2?), and the ketone-linked benzene has ethyl at position 3 and acetyloxy at position 4. \n\nIf the substituents are on different positions of their respective rings, then the molecules are different. However, if the substituents can be rotated such that their positions are equivalent, then they could be the same. Benzene rings are symmetric, so substituents in certain positions can be equivalent. \n\nFor example, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 3 are meta, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be the same. However, the exact positions matter. \n\nIn this case, the main difference is which benzene ring is considered the main ring and which is the substituent. The ethyl and acetyloxy groups are on different rings in each molecule. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nIn Molecule A, the main ring has ethyl and acetyloxy. The substituent benzene (via the ketone) has a methyl.\n\nIn Molecule B, the main ring has a methyl. The substituent benzene (via the ketone) has ethyl and acetyloxy.\n\nSo, if you imagine flipping the molecule, the main ring in A becomes the substituent in B and vice versa. But since the connectivity is via a ketone group (which is directional), flipping might not matter. However, the substituents on each benzene are different. In A's main ring: ethyl and acetyloxy. In B's substituent benzene: ethyl and acetyloxy. But their positions on the benzene might be different.\n\nWait, in A's main ring, the substituents are ethyl (position 1), acetyloxy (position 4), and ketone-linked benzene (position 5). In the substituent benzene (from A), there's a methyl at position 4.\n\nIn B's substituent benzene (the one connected via ketone), there's ethyl at position 3 and acetyloxy at position 4. So if the substituent benzene in B has ethyl at 3 and acetyloxy at 4, while the main benzene in A has ethyl at 1 and acetyloxy at 4 (with the substituent benzene having methyl at 4), then these are different arrangements.\n\nTherefore, the two molecules are not the same. They have different substituent placements on their respective benzene rings. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES strings are different representations of the same molecule due to different starting points or ring numbering. But given the substituent positions I analyzed, they seem to be different. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Let me start by looking at both SMILES and breaking them down. \n\nMolecule A is CCC(Oc1ccccc1)C(=O)Nc1nnc(S(=O)(=O)N2CCCC2)s1. Let me parse that. The main chain starts with CCC, which is a propyl group. Then there's O attached to a benzene ring (Oc1ccccc1), so that's a phenoxy group. The next part is C(=O), a carbonyl group, followed by Nc1nnc(...)s1. The nitrogen is connected to a ring that has two nitrogens (nnc), a sulfur with two sulfonyl oxygens (S(=O)(=O)), and then a N connected to a cyclohexane (N2CCCC2, but wait, N2CCCC2 would be a pyrrolidine ring, since it's five-membered: N connected to four CH2 groups and closing the ring. Wait, CC is two carbons, but the ring here is N followed by four Cs, making a five-member ring? Let me count: N2 connects to C, then three more Cs, making a total of five atoms including the N. So that's a pyrrolidine ring.\n\nNow, the sulfur in the ring is connected to the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) and the pyrrolidine. So the ring is s1 (sulfur in the ring?), wait, the SMILES notation can be tricky. Let me try to write the structure. The ring is c1nnc(...)s1. The ring starts with a carbon (c1), then two nitrogens (nn), followed by a carbon connected to the S group. Wait, the SMILES is c1nnc(S(=O)(=O)N2CCCC2)s1. So the ring is a five-membered ring: c1 (position 1), n (position 2), n (position 3), c (position 4) connected to the S group, and then s (position 5), closing the ring. So the ring is a thiazole or similar heterocycle. But the order of atoms matters. Let me sketch this mentally: positions 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (N), 4 (C), 5 (S), forming a five-membered ring. The substituents are on the S and the C at position 4? Wait, the S is at position 5, and the substituents are S(=O)(=O)N2CCCC2. So the S in the ring has two double-bonded oxygens and a connection to the pyrrolidine via N. \n\nNow, Molecule B is O=S(N1CCCC1)(c1sc(nn1)NC(=O)C(CC)Oc1ccccc1)=O. Let me parse this. The central sulfur here is part of a sulfonyl group: O=S(...)(...)=O. The substituents attached to the sulfur are N1CCCC1 and c1sc(nn1)NC(=O)C(CC)Oc1ccccc1. The N1CCCC1 is again a pyrrolidine ring. The other substituent is a benzene ring (c1sc(...) etc. Wait, let's break it down. The substituent is c1sc(nn1)NC(=O)... So this is a ring starting with c1, then s, then c connected to a group. The sc(nn1) part: the c is connected to a nn1 group. Wait, the ring is c1 (position 1), s (position 2), c (position 3) connected to nn1. Then the NC(=O) group. Wait, perhaps the ring here is a five-membered ring: positions 1 (C), 2 (S), 3 (C), 4 (N), 5 (N), closing the ring with the first C? Or maybe it's a different arrangement. Let me think. The substituent is c1sc(nn1)... So the ring starts with C1, then S, then C, and the C is connected to a group that includes nn1. The nn1 suggests a ring closure here. So perhaps the ring is C1 connected to S, then C connected to N and N which are part of a ring closure. Wait, maybe the ring is C1-S-C-N-N-C1? That would form a five-membered ring with atoms C, S, C, N, N. Let me count: C1 (position 1), S (2), C (3), N (4), N (5), and then back to C1? No, that would be a five-membered ring. But the SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to indicate closure. So if it's c1sc(nn1), the 'nn1' part would connect back to position 1. So the ring would be C1 (1), S (2), C (3), N (4), N (1), which makes a five-membered ring? Wait, that would make the ring C1-S-C-N-N-C1, but the positions would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? No, the numbering is based on the order. So the first atom is C1, then S, then C connected to N and N (nn1). The 'n1' would refer back to position 1. Wait, no, the 'nn1' is part of the 'c(nn1)' group. So the C at position 3 (after S) is connected to two N atoms, one of which is part of a ring closure (n1). Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let's try to draw it step by step.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES: O=S(...)(...)=O. The sulfur is double-bonded to two oxygens (O=S(...)(...)=O). The substituents are N1CCCC1 (pyrrolidine) and the other part: c1sc(nn1)NC(=O)C(CC)Oc1ccccc1. The c1sc(nn1) part: the ring starts with c1 (carbon), then s (sulfur), then c (carbon) connected to nn1. The nn1 would be two nitrogens, one of which is connected back to position 1 (c1). So the ring is c1-s-c-n-n1, forming a five-membered ring. So the ring would be C1-S-C-N-N-C1. That's a 5-membered ring with C, S, C, N, N. Then, the C at position 3 (the third atom in the ring, which is the C after S) is connected to NC(=O)C(CC)Oc1ccccc1. The NC(=O) is an amide group. Then C(CC) is a carbon connected to two CH2 groups and the O from the phenoxy (Oc1ccccc1). \n\nComparing this to Molecule A, which has CCC(Oc1ccccc1)C(=O)Nc1nnc(S(=O)(=O)N2CCCC2)s1. Let me see: The propyl group (CCC) is attached to the oxygen (phenoxy), then the carbonyl (C=O), then the amide N connected to the heterocycle. The heterocycle in A is a ring with C, N, N, C, S. The S is connected to the sulfonyl group and the pyrrolidine. \n\nIn Molecule B, the sulfonyl group is attached to the central sulfur, which is connected to the pyrrolidine and the heterocycle. The heterocycle in B is a ring with C, S, C, N, N. So the order of atoms in the ring is different. In A, the ring is C, N, N, C, S. In B, it's C, S, C, N, N. That would mean the rings are different in arrangement. Wait, but maybe they are the same ring but written in different orders. For example, if the ring is written starting from a different atom, the SMILES would look different, but the actual structure is the same. For example, if you start numbering from a different atom in the ring, the SMILES string changes but the molecule is the same. \n\nSo, the key is to determine whether the two SMILES strings are different representations of the same structure. Let me check if the substituents are attached in the same positions. \n\nIn Molecule A: The heterocycle is c1nnc(S(=O)(=O)N2CCCC2)s1. The ring atoms are c1 (C), n (N), n (N), c (C) connected to the S group, then s1 (S) closing the ring. So the ring is C-N-N-C-S, making a five-membered ring. The substituents are the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) connected to the pyrrolidine (N2CCCC2), attached to the C in position 4 (the fourth atom in the ring). \n\nIn Molecule B: The heterocycle is part of the substituent c1sc(nn1)..., which is a ring starting with C, then S, then C connected to nn1. The nn1 would be two N atoms connected to the first C (c1), forming a ring. So the ring here is C-S-C-N-N. That's the same five-membered ring but starting from a different position. So in A, the ring starts with C, then two N's, then C, S. In B, the ring starts with C, then S, then C, then two N's. If the rings are the same but written in different starting points, then they are the same structure. \n\nFor example, if you rotate the ring, the SMILES string can start at any atom. So in A, the ring could be written as starting at the S atom, leading to a different SMILES string. However, the substituents' positions need to be checked. \n\nIn A, the sulfonyl group is attached to the C at position 4 (c in the ring), while in B, the sulfonyl group is part of the central S which is connected to the heterocycle. Wait, no. Wait, in Molecule B, the sulfonyl group is the central S with two =O groups, connected to the pyrrolidine and the heterocycle. In Molecule A, the sulfonyl group is attached to the heterocycle's S. Wait, no. Wait, in A, the S in the heterocycle has S(=O)(=O) as substituents, making it a sulfonyl group. So the S in the ring in A is part of a sulfonamide group connected to pyrrolidine. In B, the sulfonyl group is the central S connected to the pyrrolidine and the heterocycle. \n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me compare the structures again. \n\nMolecule A's structure:\n\n- Propyl chain (CCC) connected to a phenoxy group (Oc1ccccc1).\n- Then a carbonyl (C=O) connected to an amine (N), which is connected to a heterocycle.\n- The heterocycle is a five-membered ring: C-N-N-C-S. The S in the ring has a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) connected to a pyrrolidine (N2CCCC2).\n\nMolecule B's structure:\n\n- Central sulfonyl group (O=S(...)(...)=O) connected to pyrrolidine (N1CCCC1) and a benzene ring substituent.\n- The benzene substituent is part of a heterocycle (c1sc(nn1)...). The heterocycle is a five-membered ring: C-S-C-N-N. The N is connected to an amide group (NC(=O)), then a carbon chain (C(CC)) connected to phenoxy (Oc1ccccc1).\n\nWait, but in B, the central sulfonyl group is separate from the heterocycle. The heterocycle in B has a S in the ring but not part of the central sulfonyl. Whereas in A, the sulfonyl is part of the heterocycle's S. \n\nThis suggests that the connectivity is different. In A, the sulfonyl is part of the heterocycle's S, whereas in B, the sulfonyl is a central S connected to the heterocycle and pyrrolidine. Therefore, the structures are different. \n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the SMILES. Let me re-examine Molecule B's SMILES: O=S(N1CCCC1)(c1sc(nn1)NC(=O)C(CC)Oc1ccccc1)=O. The central S is double-bonded to two O's (O=S and =O). The substituents are N1CCCC1 (pyrrolidine) and c1sc(nn1)NC(...). So the sulfur in the center is connected to the pyrrolidine and the benzene ring substituent. The benzene substituent's structure is a heterocycle (c1sc(nn1)), which is connected to NC(=O)C(CC)Oc1ccccc1. \n\nIn Molecule A, the sulfonyl group is attached to the heterocycle's sulfur. In Molecule B, the sulfonyl group is a separate central sulfur. Therefore, the connectivity is different. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting confused with the parentheses. Let me parse Molecule B again. The SMILES is O=S(N1CCCC1)(c1sc(nn1)NC(=O)C(CC)Oc1ccccc1)=O. The central S has three groups: two oxygens (as =O and O= ), but sulfur can only have four bonds. Wait, no. The SMILES notation for sulfonyl is S(=O)(=O)... So O=S(...)(...) would have two double bonds? Wait, that's not possible. Sulfur in sulfonyl groups has four bonds: two double bonds to oxygen and two single bonds to other groups. So the correct SMILES for a sulfonyl group is S(=O)(=O)(A)(B), where A and B are the substituents. \n\nIn Molecule B, the SMILES starts with O=S(N1...)(c1...)=O. That would imply the sulfur has two double bonds (O=S and =O) and two substituents (N1... and c1...). But that's four bonds: double bond to O, double bond to another O, and two single bonds. Wait, but sulfur can't have two double bonds and two single bonds because that would exceed the valence. Sulfur in sulfonyl groups has two double bonds (to two oxygens) and two single bonds to substituents, which is correct. So O=S(N1...)(c1...)=O is correct for a sulfonyl group. \n\nSo the central sulfur in B is part of the sulfonyl group connected to pyrrolidine and the heterocycle-containing substituent. \n\nIn A, the sulfonyl group is attached to the heterocycle's sulfur. Wait, no: in A's SMILES, the heterocycle's sulfur is part of the ring (s1), and the substituent is S(=O)(=O)N2CCCC2. So the S in the ring has two double-bonded oxygens and a connection to the pyrrolidine. So that's a sulfonamide group attached to the ring's sulfur. \n\nComparing to B, the sulfonyl group is a central S connected to pyrrolidine and the heterocycle substituent. \n\nSo the connectivity is different. In A, the sulfonyl is part of the heterocycle's substituent. In B, the sulfonyl is a separate group connecting the pyrrolidine and the heterocycle. \n\nTherefore, the two molecules are different. The arrangement of the sulfonyl group and the connectivity of the rings are different. Hence, the answer should be No.",

Let's start by looking at both structures carefully.\n\nMolecule A: Nc1ccc(Nc2nc(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3)cs2)cc1\nMolecule B: c1(-c2ccc(cc2)Cl)csc(n1)Nc1ccc(cc1)N\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse each SMILES to understand their structures. For Molecule A, the main structure seems to be a benzene ring (the 'c1ccc...cc1' part) with two amino groups (N). One of the amino groups is attached to another ring: a thiazole ring, perhaps? Let's break it down. The part after the first N is Nc2nc(...)cs2. The 'c2nc(...)cs2' suggests a five-membered ring with two carbons, a nitrogen, a carbon connected to a substituent, and a sulfur. The substituent here is -c3ccc(Cl)cc3, which is a benzene ring with a chlorine atom attached.\n\nSo, Molecule A has a benzene ring with two amino substituents. One amino group is connected to a thiazole ring (since there's a sulfur in the five-membered ring), and that thiazole has a benzene ring substituted with chlorine attached to it.\n\nNow, Molecule B: the SMILES starts with c1(...), which is a benzene ring. The substituent is -c2ccc(cc2)Cl, which is a benzene ring with a chlorine. Then, there's 'csc(n1)N...'. Wait, the structure here is a bit different. The main ring here seems to be a five-membered ring as well. The 'c1(-c2...)csc(n1)' part: the c1 is connected to a substituent (-c2ccc(cc2)Cl), which is the same chlorobenzene as in Molecule A. Then, the ring has a sulfur (s), another carbon (c), and then a nitrogen (n) connected back to the first carbon (n1). So this five-membered ring would be a thiazole-like structure, similar to Molecule A. Then, there's an N connected to another benzene ring: Nc1ccc(cc1)N. That's a benzene ring with two amino groups, but the positions might matter here.\n\nWait, let me draw this out mentally. In Molecule B, the main structure is a thiazole ring (sulfur and nitrogen in a five-membered ring) attached to a chlorobenzene. Then, the nitrogen of the thiazole is connected to another benzene ring that has two amino groups. The benzene in Molecule B's second part is 'c1ccc(cc1)N', which might be a para-substituted benzene with an amino group. But wait, the SMILES is Nc1ccc(cc1)N. Let me parse that: the benzene ring starts with an amino group (Nc1...), then the positions. The 'ccc(cc1)' part: the first 'c' is position 1, then positions 2,3,4. The 'cc1)' suggests that after position 4, there's another carbon (position 5) connected back to position 1. Wait, no, SMILES notation builds the ring with the numbers as you go. Let me reconstruct. For Nc1ccc(cc1)N: the first N is connected to position 1 of the benzene. Then positions 2, 3, 4. Then, in the fourth position, there's a connection to another carbon (position 5?), but perhaps that's part of the ring closure. Alternatively, maybe the benzene is N-substituted at position 1, then positions 2,3,4 are carbons, and then another N is attached at position 4. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's N connected to benzene at position 1, then positions 2,3,4 are carbons, and the next 'cc1)' would be positions 5 and 6, closing the ring. But the second N is at position 4? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring in the second part of Molecule B is para-substituted with two amino groups. Let's see: the SMILES Nc1ccc(cc1)N. The first N is attached to position 1. Then, the benzene ring is positions 1 through 6. The 'ccc(cc1)' part: after position 1 (N), positions 2, 3, 4, then 'cc1' would be positions 5 and 6 connected back to position 1? That doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the SMILES is Nc1ccc(cc1)N. The first N is at position 1. The ring is built as 1 (N), then positions 2, 3, 4 (c, c, c), then (cc1) would be positions 5 and 6, which are connected to position 1. But then the second N is at position 5? Or perhaps the SMILES is written as N attached to position 1, then positions 2, 3, 4, followed by positions 5 and 6 (the 'cc1') which connects back to position 1, making the benzene ring. Then the second N is at position 4? That would make the amino groups at positions 1 and 4, which are para to each other. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the first N is at position 1, and the second N is at position 4, that's para. So the benzene ring in Molecule B's second part has two amino groups in para positions.\n\nNow, comparing to Molecule A. Molecule A's main benzene ring is Nc1ccc(...)cc1. Let's parse that. The first N is at position 1. The ring is 1 (N), then positions 2,3,4 (c, c, c). Then, position 5 has another substituent (Nc2...), and position 6 is another c. So the main benzene ring in A has amino groups at positions 1 and 5? Wait, that's adjacent positions (1 and 5 are meta, but in a six-membered ring, positions 1 and 4 are para, 1 and 2 are ortho, 1 and 3 are meta. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's imagine the benzene ring as positions 1 through 6 in a circle. In SMILES notation, the order in which the atoms are written can affect the numbering. For example, Nc1ccc(N...)cc1: the first N is attached to position 1. Then, the next three carbons (positions 2,3,4). Then, position 5 is another substituent (N...), and position 6 is another carbon, closing the ring. So the amino groups are at positions 1 and 5, which would be meta to each other (since 1 and 5 are two positions apart in a six-membered ring). Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 4 are para. Positions 1 and 2 are ortho. Positions 1 and 3 are meta. Wait, no. Let me count: 1 (start), 2 (ortho), 3 (meta), 4 (para), 5 (meta again?), 6 (ortho again). Wait, no, the positions are adjacent. So in a benzene ring, position 1's ortho is 2 and 6, meta is 3 and 5, and para is 4. So if in Molecule A's main benzene, the substituents are at positions 1 and 5, that's meta. But in Molecule B's second benzene, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para). So that would be a difference.\n\nSo, the main benzene rings in the two molecules have their amino groups in different positions: meta in A and para in B. Therefore, the molecules would not be the same. However, wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the SMILES strings. Let me check again.\n\nMolecule A: Nc1ccc(Nc2nc(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3)cs2)cc1\n\nBreaking down the main benzene ring: starts with N attached to position 1. Then, positions 2,3,4 are c, c, c. The fourth position (position 4) has a substituent Nc2... Then, positions 5 and 6 are c, c. So the main benzene has amino groups at positions 1 and 4 (since the substituent after the three c's (positions 2-4) is at position 4, which is Nc2...). Wait, that's possible. Let me clarify: the SMILES notation for the benzene ring is Nc1ccc(...)cc1. The 'c1' starts the ring. The N is attached to position 1. Then, three c's (positions 2,3,4). Then, the next part is Nc2... which is a substituent at position 4. Then, two more c's (positions 5 and 6) to close the ring. So the main benzene ring in A has amino groups at positions 1 and 4 (para). Then, the substituent at position 4 is a N connected to a thiazole ring (c2nc(...)cs2). The thiazole has a substituent -c3ccc(Cl)cc3, which is a benzene ring with Cl at position 4 (since the SMILES is c3ccc(Cl)cc3: starts at position 1, positions 2,3,4 (Cl), positions 5,6 back to 3? Wait, no. Let me parse that substituent: -c3ccc(Cl)cc3. The benzene ring here (c3ccc(Cl)cc3) would have Cl at position 4. Because the c3 starts at position 1, then positions 2,3,4 (Cl), then positions 5 and 6 connected back to position 3. Wait, that would make a ring closure between positions 3 and 5, which is impossible. Wait, perhaps the substituent is benzene with Cl at position 3. Let me think again. SMILES notation for benzene: c1ccccc1. The substituent here is c3ccc(Cl)cc3. So starting at position 1 (c3), then positions 2,3,4 (c, c, Cl), then positions 5,6 (c, c3). That would form a benzene ring where Cl is at position 4. Because after position 4 (Cl), the next two carbons (positions 5 and 6) connect back to position 3. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the Cl is at position 3. Let me count:\n\nThe SMILES is c3ccc(Cl)cc3. So the ring starts at atom 3 (denoted by c3), then next three atoms are c, c, Cl (positions 1,2,3?), but SMILES notation can be confusing. Alternatively, maybe the ring is written as c3 (atom 1), then c (atom 2), c (atom 3), c (atom 4) with Cl, then c (atom 5), c (atom 6), and back to atom 3. Wait, that would create a ring closure from atom 6 to atom 3, making a benzene ring with Cl at position 4. But that would make the ring have a bridge, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: the substituent -c3ccc(Cl)cc3 is a benzene ring where one of the carbons is replaced by Cl. Let's write it out as a benzene ring with six members. The SMILES starts with c3 (atom 1), then c (atom 2), c (atom 3), Cl at atom 4 (since it's in parentheses), then c (atom 5), c (atom 6), and back to c3 (atom 1). So the Cl is at position 4. So the substituent is a para-chlorophenyl group.\n\nTherefore, in Molecule A, the thiazole ring is attached to a para-chlorophenyl group. The thiazole is connected via the nitrogen to the main benzene's position 4, which has an amino group (Nc2...).\n\nNow, looking at Molecule B: c1(-c2ccc(cc2)Cl)csc(n1)Nc1ccc(cc1)N.\n\nBreaking this down. The main ring here is a five-membered ring: c1 is part of the ring. The substituent on c1 is -c2ccc(cc2)Cl. Let's parse that: c2 is the start of another benzene ring. The substituent is a benzene ring with Cl. The SMILES c2ccc(cc2)Cl: starting at c2 (atom 1), then c (2), c (3), c (4), then (cc2) would be atoms 5 and 6 connected back to atom 1 (c2). So the benzene ring has Cl at position 4 (para). So the substituent is para-chlorophenyl, same as in Molecule A.\n\nThe main ring in Molecule B is c1(-c2...)csc(n1). So the ring is: c1 (with substituent), s, c, n1. Wait, the ring is c1 connected to s, then c, then n connected back to c1. So the five-membered ring would be c1-s-c-n-c1? Wait, that's four members. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me count the atoms in the ring. The SMILES is c1(...)csc(n1). The c1 starts the ring. Then there's a substituent (-c2...Cl), then 'csc(n1)'. So the ring atoms are:\n\n1. c1 (with substituent)\n2. s\n3. c\n4. n (connected back to c1 via n1)\n\nWait, that's four atoms. But a five-membered ring would require five atoms. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's see: the entire SMILES for Molecule B starts with c1(-c2...) which is part of the ring. Then comes 'csc(n1)'. So the ring is c1 connected to s, then c, then c connected to n1 (which is the first c1). So the ring would be c1-s-c-c-n1? That's five atoms: c1, s, c, c, n. Wait, but the 'csc(n1)' part: after the first c1, there's s, then another c, then n1. So the sequence is c1-s-c-n1. That would form a four-membered ring, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the SMILES is written as c1(-c2...)csc(n1), meaning that after the substituent, the next atoms are c, s, c, and then n1. Wait, maybe the ring is c1, c (from 'csc'), s, c, n, back to c1. That would make a five-membered ring. Let me try again:\n\nThe main ring in Molecule B is c1 connected to the substituent (-c2...Cl), then followed by 'csc(n1)'. So the ring is:\n\n1. c1 (with substituent)\n2. c (from 'c' in 'csc')\n3. s (from 's' in 'csc')\n4. c (from the next 'c' in 'csc')\n5. n (from 'n1') connected back to c1.\n\nWait, that makes five atoms: positions 1 (c1), 2 (c), 3 (s), 4 (c), 5 (n), closing back to c1. So it's a five-membered ring with atoms c1, c, s, c, n. That would be a thiazole-like structure, where the positions are nitrogen and sulfur. The substituent on c1 is the para-chlorophenyl group, same as in Molecule A. Then, the n (position 5) is connected to another benzene ring via N: 'Nc1ccc(cc1)N'. Wait, the 'Nc1ccc(cc1)N' is another benzene ring with two amino groups. Let's parse this part: N connected to c1 (benzene position 1), then positions 2,3,4 (c, c, c), then (cc1) which would be positions 5 and 6 connected back to position 1. The second N is attached where? The SMILES is Nc1ccc(cc1)N. So after the three c's (positions 2,3,4), we have 'cc1' which is positions 5 and 6, connected back to position 1. The second N is attached to position 4. So the benzene ring has amino groups at positions 1 and 4 (para positions). \n\nSo in Molecule B, the structure is a thiazole ring (with para-chlorophenyl substituent) connected via the nitrogen to a para-aminophenyl group (benzene with amino at 1 and 4). \n\nComparing to Molecule A, which has a benzene ring (positions 1 and 4) with amino groups, connected via the position 4 amino to a thiazole ring (which has the para-chlorophenyl substituent). \n\nWait, but wait\u2014Molecule A's main benzene has amino groups at positions 1 and 4 (para), connected to the thiazole. The thiazole is attached to the main benzene's position 4 via an amino group (Nc2...). The thiazole in A is connected to the para-chlorophenyl group. \n\nIn Molecule B, the thiazole is attached to the para-chlorophenyl group at position 1 of the thiazole ring, and the nitrogen of the thiazole is connected to a benzene ring that has amino groups at positions 1 and 4 (para). \n\nSo both molecules have a thiazole ring with para-chlorophenyl substituent and a benzene ring with two amino groups connected via a nitrogen. The difference lies in the connectivity. In Molecule A, the main benzene (with para amino groups) is connected via one of its amino groups (position 4) to the thiazole. In Molecule B, the thiazole's nitrogen is connected to a benzene ring with para amino groups. \n\nWait, but let me visualize both structures. \n\nMolecule A: para-aminophenyl (positions 1 and 4) -> the position 4 amino is connected to a thiazole ring. The thiazole has a para-chlorophenyl group. \n\nMolecule B: thiazole ring with para-chlorophenyl substituent on one carbon, and the nitrogen of the thiazole connected to a para-aminophenyl group. \n\nSo the two molecules are structural isomers. The main difference is which part is the central benzene. In A, the central part is the benzene with two amino groups, connected to the thiazole. In B, the central part is the thiazole, connected to a benzene with two amino groups. \n\nWait, but wait\u2014that might not be correct. Let me check the connectivity again. \n\nIn Molecule A, the SMILES is Nc1ccc(Nc2nc(...)cs2)cc1. The main benzene (c1) has amino groups at positions 1 and 4. The amino at position 4 is connected to the thiazole ring (Nc2...). The thiazole's nitrogen is part of the ring. \n\nIn Molecule B, the SMILES starts with the thiazole ring (c1(-...)csc(n1)), where the nitrogen (n1) is connected to the para-aminophenyl group (Nc1ccc(cc1)N). \n\nSo in A, the thiazole is a substituent on the main benzene's amino group. In B, the thiazole is the central ring, with substituents being the chlorophenyl and the para-aminophenyl groups. \n\nTherefore, the two molecules are different because the connectivity is reversed. The core structure in A is the benzene with amino groups, while in B, the core is the thiazole ring. \n\nAnother way to check is to compare canonical SMILES. Sometimes different SMILES strings can represent the same molecule if they are canonicalized. But since the user is asking to determine if they are the same based on the given SMILES, perhaps we can compare the connectivity. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the two SMILES are actually the same molecule but written in different orders. Let's see: sometimes SMILES can be written starting from different atoms, leading to different strings but the same structure. For example, if the main benzene in A is the same as the one connected to the thiazole in B, but written in a different order. \n\nTo check this, perhaps we can try to generate the canonical SMILES for both and see if they match. However, without doing that programmatically, I need to reason it out. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two structures are enantiomers or different conformers, but that's unlikely to affect the SMILES determination. \n\nAnother approach: count the number of each type of atom and bonds. Both molecules should have the same molecular formula. Let's count:\n\nMolecule A: \n\nMain benzene (6 C, 5 H), two amino groups (2 N). Thiazole ring (5-membered: 3 C, 1 N, 1 S). The substituent on the thiazole is a benzene ring (6 C, 5 H) with Cl. \n\nSo total C: 6 (main benzene) + 5 (thiazole, assuming the substituent's benzene is connected via a single bond) + 6 (chlorobenzene) = 17 C. Wait, no. Let me correct: the main benzene is 6 C. The thiazole ring has 3 C (since two are part of the ring: the 'nc(...)cs2' part. Wait, the thiazole is a five-membered ring with 2 C, 1 N, 1 S, and another C (from the substituent). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's break down the thiazole in A: the SMILES part is Nc2nc(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3)cs2. The thiazole ring is c2 (C), n (N), c (C), -c3... (C connected to benzene), s (S), back to c2. So the ring is C, N, C, C, S. Wait, that's five members: C (c2), N, C (from 'nc'), C (from the substituent?), S (s), and back to C (c2). Wait, no, the substituent is attached to one of the carbons. The thiazole ring in SMILES is c2nc(...)cs2. So the ring is c2 (C1), n (N2), c (C3), substituent (-c3...), s (S4), and back to c2 (C1). So the thiazole ring has four members? That can't be. Wait, no. The ring closure is between c2 and s2. Wait, the 'nc(...)cs2' part: n is followed by c (which is part of the ring), then substituent, then c (another ring atom), then s, and the ring closure is to c2 (position 2). So the ring atoms are c2 (C1), n (N2), c (C3), c (C4), s (S5), and back to C1. So it's a five-membered ring: C1, N2, C3, C4, S5. The substituent is attached to C3. \n\nSo the thiazole in A has 3 C, 1 N, 1 S. The substituent is a benzene ring (6 C, 1 Cl). The main benzene has 6 C, 2 N. The thiazole's substituent adds 6 C and 1 Cl. The amino groups add 2 N. \n\nSo total atoms for A: \n\nC: 6 (main benzene) + 3 (thiazole) + 6 (chlorobenzene) = 15 C\n\nN: 2 (main benzene) + 1 (thiazole's N) + 1 (amino group connecting to thiazole) = 4 N? Wait, the thiazole's N is part of the ring. Wait, in the thiazole ring, the N is part of the ring. The substituent from the main benzene's amino is connected to the thiazole's N. Wait, no: the SMILES for the substituent in A is Nc2nc(...), which means the amino group (from the main benzene's position 4) is connected to the c2 of the thiazole ring. Wait, no: the 'Nc2...' indicates that the amino group is attached to the c2 of the thiazole ring. Wait, the thiazole ring is written as c2nc(...)cs2. So c2 is the first atom of the thiazole ring. The amino group (from the main benzene) is connected to c2. Then, the thiazole ring has N at position 2 (n), followed by c (position 3), which is connected to the chlorophenyl group. Then c (position 4), s (position 5), and back to c2 (position 1). \n\nSo the thiazole in A has an amino group connected to c2 (position 1 of the thiazole). The thiazole's nitrogen is at position 2. \n\nSo the amino group from the main benzene is connected to position 1 of the thiazole. The chlorophenyl group is connected to position 3 of the thiazole. \n\nNow, for Molecule B: the thiazole ring has the chlorophenyl group connected to c1 (position 1), and the nitrogen (n1) is connected to the para-aminophenyl group. \n\nSo the thiazole in B has chlorophenyl at position 1, and the nitrogen at position 5 connected to the para-aminophenyl. \n\nIn contrast, the thiazole in A has the amino group (from main benzene) connected to position 1, and chlorophenyl at position 3. \n\nTherefore, the substituents on the thiazole are in different positions in A and B, making the molecules different. \n\nAdditionally, the connectivity between the thiazole and the benzene rings differs. In A, the thiazole is connected via position 1 to the main benzene's amino, while in B, the thiazole's nitrogen is connected to the para-aminophenyl. \n\nTherefore, the two molecules are not the same. The answer should be No.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. The molecules given are:\n\nMolecule A: CC1C2Cc3ccc(N)cc3C1(C)CCN2\nMolecule B: C1NC2Cc3ccc(cc3C(C)(C2C)C1)N\n\nFirst, I should recall that SMILES strings can sometimes look different but still represent the same molecule because of the way the atoms are numbered or the rings are closed. To check if they're the same, I can try converting both SMILES into their canonical forms using a tool like RDKit in Python. But since I'm doing this manually, I need to break down each structure.\n\nLet's start with Molecule A: CC1C2Cc3ccc(N)cc3C1(C)CCN2.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- The first part is CC1C2C... So there's a carbon connected to another carbon (C1), which is part of a ring with C2. Then another carbon (C) attached. Then there's a c3ccc(N)cc3, which is a benzene ring with a nitrogen substituent. The C1(C) part suggests that the first ring (C1) has a methyl group (from the C in C1(C)). Then CCN2, which is a chain ending with N2, which is part of another ring.\n\nMolecule B: C1NC2Cc3ccc(cc3C(C)(C2C)C1)N.\n\nBreaking down Molecule B:\n- Starts with C1N... so a nitrogen in a ring (C1). Then C2C... another ring (C2). The benzene ring here is c3ccc(cc3...), which might be a benzene ring with substituents. The part C(C)(C2C)C1 suggests branching here. The ending is N, which might be a substituent on the benzene.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to try drawing the structures. Let me try to parse each SMILES step by step.\n\nFor Molecule A:\n- The main structure has two rings. Let's see, starting with CC1C2C... So C1 is part of a ring, and C2 is another ring. The Cc3ccc(N)cc3 part is a cyclopropane? Or wait, the lowercase c indicates aromatic rings. Wait, no, lowercase c is for aromatic carbons. So c3ccc(N)cc3 would be a benzene ring (since six aromatic carbons) with a nitrogen substituent. Wait, but in SMILES, aromatic rings are usually written with lowercase letters. So in Molecule A, the benzene ring is c3ccc(N)cc3, which is a benzene ring where one of the carbons is replaced by a nitrogen? Wait, no, the N is a substituent. Wait, in SMILES, parentheses denote branches. So the benzene ring is c3ccc(N)cc3. So position 4 (if we count starting at 1) has an NH2 group? Wait, no, the N here would be an amine group attached to the benzene. Wait, but in SMILES, the order matters. So c3ccc(N)cc3 would have the nitrogen attached at the fourth carbon of the benzene ring. Then, the rest of the structure connects to that benzene ring via C1 and C2 rings.\n\nMolecule B: C1NC2Cc3ccc(cc3C(C)(C2C)C1)N.\n\nBreaking this down, starting with C1N... which is part of a ring. Then C2C... another ring. The benzene ring is c3ccc(cc3...), which would be a benzene ring. Then C(C)(C2C)C1. This part might be a branching point. The ending N is outside the benzene ring.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to build the structures mentally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two molecules are stereoisomers, but the SMILES doesn't indicate stereochemistry here, so they might be the same. Or maybe they are different in the arrangement of substituents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rings are connected differently. Let's try to see the connectivity.\n\nIn Molecule A: The main rings are C1 and C2. The benzene ring (c3) is connected to C1 and C2. The structure might be a bicyclic system with a benzene ring attached. The C1 has a methyl group (from CC1), and the C2 is connected to a CCN2 group, which is part of the ring closure.\n\nIn Molecule B: The rings are C1 and C2 as well. The benzene ring is attached to C2 and C1 via different positions. The substituents on the benzene are different? Let's see: in B, the benzene is c3ccc(cc3...). The substituents are in positions that might be different. Also, the nitrogen in B is at the end of the SMILES, but perhaps attached to the benzene ring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two molecules are the same but written in different orders. For example, the benzene ring's substituent (N) might be in a different position, but due to the symmetry of the benzene ring, they could be the same. Wait, but benzene rings with substituents in different positions are different unless they're in positions that are equivalent due to symmetry.\n\nWait, but in SMILES, the order of writing the substituents doesn't matter if the positions are equivalent. However, if the substituent is in a different position that isn't symmetric, then they are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two SMILES strings are just different representations of the same molecule. To check this, I need to canonicalize both and compare.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, I need to see if the connectivity is the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to count the number of atoms and bonds. Let's see:\n\nMolecule A: Let's count the atoms. The SMILES is CC1C2Cc3ccc(N)cc3C1(C)CCN2.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first C is a methyl group (CC1...)\n- Then C1 is part of a ring. The ring closure is at the end with C1(...)C1(...)\n- Then C2 is another ring closure.\n- The benzene ring (c3ccc(N)cc3) has six aromatic carbons, one with an NH2 group (assuming N here is NH2? Or is it a nitrile? Wait, in SMILES, N is NH2 if it's a primary amine. Wait, actually, in SMILES, the valence is handled automatically. So if N has two substituents, it's NH, etc. But in the benzene ring, the N would be part of an aromatic ring? No, because the benzene is made of carbons (lowercase c) and the N is a substituent. So the benzene ring has five carbons and one N? Wait, no. The benzene ring in SMILES is made of six aromatic atoms. In Molecule A's SMILES, the benzene part is c3ccc(N)cc3. So starting at atom 3 (c3), then three aromatic carbons (ccc), then an N (but N is not aromatic, so this is a substituent. Wait, no. Wait, in SMILES, the nitrogen in the benzene ring would have to be part of the aromatic system, which would require it to be in a ring with proper aromatic bonding. But in this case, the N is in the middle of the benzene ring's SMILES notation. Wait, perhaps the N is a substituent. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe benzene ring is written as c3ccc(N)cc3. The parentheses mean that the N is a branch off the fourth carbon in the benzene ring. So the benzene ring is six aromatic carbons, with one of them (position 4) having an NH2 group attached. Then the rest of the structure connects back to the bicyclic system.\n\nIn Molecule B: C1NC2Cc3ccc(cc3C(C)(C2C)C1)N.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe SMILES starts with C1N, which indicates that the nitrogen is part of a ring (ring closure at C1). Then C2C... part of another ring. The benzene ring is c3ccc(cc3...), which would be a benzene ring where the fourth and fifth positions have branches. The cc3C(C)(C2C)C1 part: after the benzene ring (c3), there's a carbon connected to the benzene. That carbon has branches: C(C) (a methyl group), (C2C) which is part of the C2 ring, and C1 which is part of the first ring. Then the ending N is another substituent.\n\nWait, this is getting quite complex. Maybe the key difference is the position of the nitrogen substituent on the benzene ring and how the rings are connected.\n\nIn Molecule A, the benzene has an NH2 group in one position, and in Molecule B, the benzene has an NH2 group in a different position. If the positions are different and not symmetric, then the molecules are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rings are connected in a way that makes the structures identical when considering the overall connectivity.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to write the SMILES in a way that shows the connectivity.\n\nFor Molecule A:\n\n- The main structure is a bicyclic system (two rings) connected to a benzene ring. The benzene has an NH2 group. The bicyclic system might be something like a decalin-like structure but with different substituents.\n\nFor Molecule B:\n\n- The bicyclic system might be similar but connected differently, and the benzene's NH2 is in a different position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES strings are just different representations of the same molecule. For example, the starting point of the SMILES might be different, leading to different numbering but the same structure.\n\nTo check this, I can try to generate the canonical SMILES for both using a tool. Since I can't do that here, I need to mentally compare.\n\nAnother approach: Check if the molecular formulas are the same. Let's count the atoms.\n\nMolecule A:\n\n- CC1C2Cc3ccc(N)cc3C1(C)CCN2\n\nCounting all atoms:\n\nCarbons: Let's parse each character:\n\n- C (1)\n- C1 (another C, part of ring 1)\n- C2 (another C, part of ring 2)\n- C (another C)\n- c3 (aromatic C, part of ring 3)\n- c (aromatic C)\n- c (aromatic C)\n- c(N) (aromatic C, then N)\n- c (aromatic C)\n- c3 (aromatic C, closes ring 3)\n- C1 (C part of ring 1)\n- (C) (another C, methyl group)\n- C (another C)\n- C (another C)\n- N2 (N part of ring 2)\n\nNitrogens: the N in the benzene and the N2 in the ring.\n\nWait, the SMILES is a bit tricky. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nMolecule A: CC1C2Cc3ccc(N)cc3C1(C)CCN2\n\nBreaking into tokens:\n\n1. C: Carbon\n2. C1: Carbon in ring 1\n3. C2: Carbon in ring 2\n4. C: Carbon\n5. c3: Aromatic carbon in ring 3\n6. c: Aromatic carbon\n7. c: Aromatic carbon\n8. (N): Branch with N\n9. c: Aromatic carbon\n10. c: Aromatic carbon\n11. 3: Closes ring 3\n12. C1: Carbon in ring 1\n13. (C): Branch with C (methyl)\n14. C: Carbon\n15. C: Carbon\n16. N2: Nitrogen in ring 2\n17. 2: Closes ring 2\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to expand the SMILES without the ring closures.\n\nFor Molecule A:\n\nStart at the first C (let's call this C0). Then C0 is connected to C1 (ring 1). C1 is connected to C2 (ring 2). C2 is connected to another C (C3). C3 is connected to c3 (aromatic carbon in ring 3). Then we have c4 (next aromatic carbon), c5, then (N) which is a branch here. So the benzene ring is c3-c4-c5-N (wait, no, the SMILES is c3ccc(N)cc3. Let's parse that part:\n\nc3 is the first aromatic carbon. Then three carbons (c c c), then a branch (N), then two more carbons (c c), then close ring 3 (back to c3). So the benzene ring is c3 connected to c4, c5, c6, then a branch to N (so c6 has a substituent N), then c7 and c8 (but since it's a benzene ring, it's six members. So positions c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, c8, with c6 having an N substituent. Wait, but how are the positions arranged? The SMILES c3ccc(N)cc3 would be: starting at c3, then three carbons (c4, c5, c6), then a branch (N) off c6, then two more carbons (c7, c8), then back to c3. That forms a benzene ring with the N substituent on position c6 (which is the fourth carbon in the sequence). But in a benzene ring, the positions are in a cycle, so the substituent's position depends on where you start. However, in SMILES, the numbering can vary based on the starting point, so the actual position might be different if the starting point is different.\n\nNow, the rest of Molecule A: after the benzene ring, we have C1(C) which means the ring 1 closure is at C1 with a methyl group (from the (C) branch). Then C, C, N2 which is part of ring 2's closure.\n\nIn Molecule B: C1NC2Cc3ccc(cc3C(C)(C2C)C1)N\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nStart with C1 connected to N, then C2, then C, then c3 (aromatic ring 3). The benzene ring is c3ccc(cc3...). So c3, c4, c5, c6, then a branch (cc3...), which would be c6 connected to c7 and then back to c3? Wait, no. The part c3ccc(cc3...) would be c3 connected to c4, c5, c6, then a branch starting with two carbons (c and c), then closing back to c3. That forms a benzene ring as well. But the substituents here are in different positions. The cc part would mean that after c6 (fourth carbon), there are two more carbons (c7 and c8), then back to c3. That forms a six-membered aromatic ring. However, the substituents are attached at positions c6 and c7? Or perhaps the branch is after c6, which is connected to other atoms.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Let me try to count the atoms again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both molecules have the same molecular formula. Let's count the atoms.\n\nMolecule A: Count all C and N.\n\nCarbons: Let's see:\n\n- The SMILES starts with C (1), then C1 (2), C2 (3), C (4), c3 (5 aromatic), c (6), c (7), c (8), then N (1 nitrogen), c (9), c (10), C1 (11), C (12 from the (C)), C (13), C (14), N2 (2nd nitrogen). Wait, but aromatic carbons are lowercase, but they're still carbons. So the total carbons:\n\nEach 'C' or 'c' is a carbon. Let's count:\n\nMolecule A:\n\nCC1C2Cc3ccc(N)cc3C1(C)CCN2\n\nBreaking into individual atoms (excluding ring closures as numbers):\n\nC, C, C, C, c, c, c, c, N, c, c, C, C, C, C, N\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some. Let's parse each character:\n\n1. C\n2. C1\n3. C2\n4. C\n5. c3\n6. c\n7. c\n8. c (then branch (N))\n9. c\n10. c\n11. 3 (ring closure)\n12. C1\n13. (C)\n14. C\n15. C\n16. N2\n17. 2 (ring closure)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of actual atoms:\n\nThe SMILES string is:\n\nC C1 C2 C c3 c c c (N) c c 3 C1 (C) C C N2 2\n\nSo:\n\n- The first C (non-ring)\n- C1 (ring 1)\n- C2 (ring 2)\n- C (non-ring)\n- c3 (aromatic ring 3)\n- c\n- c\n- c (with branch (N))\n- c\n- c\n- back to c3 (closing ring 3)\n- C1 (ring 1 closure)\n- (C) (methyl branch)\n- C\n- C\n- N2 (ring 2 closure)\n- 2 (closing ring 2)\n\nSo the carbons:\n\nFirst C: 1\nC1: 2\nC2: 3\nC: 4\nc3: 5\nc:6\nc:7\nc:8 (with N branch)\nc:9\nc:10\nC1: same as 2\nC in (C): 11\nC:12\nC:13\nN2: N in ring 2\nN from branch:14?\n\nWait, this is getting messy. Alternatively, the total number of carbons:\n\nEvery 'C' or 'c' is a carbon. Let's count all the Cs and cs:\n\nMolecule A:\n\nC, C, C, C, c, c, c, c, c, c, C, C, C, C, C.\n\nWait, but some of these are part of rings. Let's see:\n\nThe SMILES string: CC1C2Cc3ccc(N)cc3C1(C)CCN2\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- The first four characters: C, C1, C2, C \u2192 4 carbons.\n- Then c3, c, c, c, (N), c, c, c3 \u2192 aromatic ring: 6 carbons (c3 to c3 via 6 members).\n- Then C1 (already counted), (C) \u2192 another C.\n- Then C, C, N2 \u2192 two more Cs.\n\nSo total carbons: 4 (initial) + 6 (aromatic) + 1 (methyl branch) + 2 (end Cs) = 13 carbons. Plus the N in the benzene and the N in the ring. Total N: 2.\n\nMolecule B: C1NC2Cc3ccc(cc3C(C)(C2C)C1)N.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nC1, N, C2, C, c3, c, c, c, (cc3...), etc.\n\nCarbons:\n\nC1, C2, C, c3, c, c, c, c, c, c, C, C, C, C, C, N.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nC1, N, C2, C, c3, c, c, c, (c, c, 3), C, (C), (C2, C), C1, N.\n\nBut this is confusing. Alternatively, the total carbons:\n\nEvery 'C' and 'c' in the SMILES:\n\nC1, C2, C, c3, c, c, c, c, c, c, C, C, C, C, C, C.\n\nPossibly 16 carbons? Not sure. Maybe the same as Molecule A? But I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both have the same molecular formula. If they do, then they could be the same or isomers. If not, they're different.\n\nAssuming the molecular formulas are the same (C13H18N2?), but I'm not certain.\n\nAnother angle: Check if the rings are the same. Molecule A has a bicyclic system connected to a benzene with an NH2. Molecule B might have the same but with the NH2 in a different position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two SMILES are different representations of the same structure. For example, the benzene's NH2 is in a position that's equivalent when considering the entire molecule's symmetry.\n\nBut without a tool, it's hard to say. Given the complexity, I'll have to make a educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the SMILES strings can be renumbered to match.\n\nMolecule A: CC1C2Cc3ccc(N)cc3C1(C)CCN2\n\nLet's try to reindex the rings. Suppose the main bicyclic system is a fused ring. The benzene is attached to one of the rings. The substituents on the bicyclic rings are methyl groups and amines.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES has the nitrogen in a different part. The main rings might be the same, but the substituents' positions differ.\n\nAlternatively, the two molecules are enantiomers or different conformers, but SMILES usually doesn't denote stereochemistry unless specified with @ or @@.\n\nAnother thought: If I can mentally rotate or rearrange the SMILES to see if they match.\n\nFor example, in Molecule A, the benzene has an NH2 at a certain position. In Molecule B, maybe it's at a different position, but due to the molecule's symmetry, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, the connectivity might be different. For instance, in Molecule A, the benzene is attached to C1 and C2, while in B, it's attached to C2 and another carbon.\n\nThis is really challenging without visualizing the structures.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll assume that the two SMILES strings represent different molecules, possibly due to the position of the nitrogen substituent on the benzene ring or the connectivity of the rings. Therefore, the answer is \"No\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. The user provided Molecule A and Molecule B. Let me start by parsing both SMILES and comparing their structures.\n\nFirst, Molecule A: Nc1ccc(-c2nnc(NC(=O)Nc3ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c3)s2)cc1. Breaking this down. The main ring is a benzene (six-membered aromatic ring) with an amino group (NH2) attached. Then there's a substituent coming off the benzene: -c2nnc(...)s2. That looks like a thiazole ring or similar heterocycle. The substituent on the thiazole is NC(=O)Nc3ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c3. So, that's a urea group (NC(=O)N-) connected to another benzene ring which has two Cl atoms in the para positions (since the third ring is c3ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c3, meaning positions 3 and 4? Wait, SMILES notation can be a bit tricky. Let me visualize. The third benzene ring (c3ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c3) would have Cl substituents at positions 3 and 4 if the numbering starts at the first carbon. But SMILES is written in a way that depends on the order. Alternatively, the positions might be adjacent. Let me think. The SMILES is written as c3ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c3. So starting at the first carbon, then positions 4 and 5 would be Cl? Wait, no. Let's break it down. For benzene rings in SMILES, the order is the order of writing. So the first carbon is 1, then moving around the ring. So c3 (1) connected to c (2), then c (3), Cl (4), c (5), Cl (6), c3 (back to 1). So the Cls are on positions 4 and 6 of the benzene ring, which would be para to each other. So that's a para-substituted benzene with two Cls. Then the urea group connects that benzene to the thiazole ring. The thiazole ring (c2nnc(...)s2) has a nitrogen at position 2 and another at position 3, with a sulfur at position 5? Wait, thiazole is a five-membered ring with S and N. Let me check. The SMILES is c2nnc(...)s2. So the ring starts with a carbon (c2), then two nitrogens (nn), followed by a carbon (c), and then sulfur (s2). So the ring would be C-N-N-C-S, forming a five-membered ring. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe the thiazole is structured as S-C-N-C=N-C. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different arrangement. Wait, SMILES notation for thiazole is usually c1nscs1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out. The SMILES for the substituent in Molecule A is -c2nnc(NC(=O)Nc3...)s2. So the ring starts with a carbon (c2), then two nitrogens (nn), then another carbon (c) connected to the urea group, then sulfur (s2) closing the ring. So the ring would be c2 connected to the first N, then another N, then the c connected to the urea, then the s2. That makes a five-membered ring: C-N-N-C-S, but that's not a standard thiazole. Thiazole has S, N, and three carbons. Wait, maybe this is a triazole or another heterocycle. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is written differently. Let me think again. The substituent from the main benzene in Molecule A is -c2nnc(...)s2. The ring is written as c2nnc(...)s2. So the ring closure is between the first carbon (c2) and the sulfur (s2). The sequence is c2 followed by n, n, c, and then s2. So the ring is C (1) connected to N (2), N (3), C (4), S (5), and back to C (1). That would form a five-membered ring with two adjacent nitrogens. That's like a 1,2,3-triazole? Wait, but triazoles have three nitrogens. Hmm. Alternatively, this could be a 1,2-diazole with a sulfur? Not sure. The exact structure might be a bit complex, but the key is to compare the substituents and their positions.\n\nNow, Molecule B: c1(c(Cl)cc(NC(Nc2nnc(s2)-c2ccc(N)cc2)=O)cc1)Cl. Let's parse this. The main ring is a benzene (c1(...)cc1). The substituents are Cl at position 1 (since c1 is the first carbon, and then c(Cl) would be adjacent?), then another Cl at the end. Wait, the SMILES is c1(c(Cl)cc(...)cc1)Cl. The main ring starts with c1, then a branch: c(Cl) connected to the first carbon. Then the ring continues with cc(...)cc1. So the Cls are on adjacent positions? Let me try to write it out. The benzene ring has Cl at position 2 (since the first carbon is connected to a Cl via the branch) and another Cl at position 6 (the closing part). Wait, maybe the positions are para. Alternatively, perhaps the main benzene in Molecule B has two Cl substituents on adjacent carbons. Let's see. The SMILES is c1(c(Cl)cc(...)cc1)Cl. The first carbon (1) has a Cl attached (from the branch c(Cl)), then positions 2 and 3 are carbons (from the cc), then the substituent NC(...)=O, followed by another c and c1. The Cl at the end is attached to which position? Wait, the entire main ring is c1(...)Cl. So after the main ring closes, there's a Cl attached to position 1? That can't be right. Wait, the SMILES is written as c1(...)Cl. The Cl is part of the main ring's substituents. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with c1: the first carbon is 1. Then there's a branch: (c(Cl)cc(NC(...))cc1). So the main ring is carbon 1 connected to a carbon that has a Cl (so carbon 2?), then followed by cc (carbons 3 and 4?), then the substituent NC(...), then another cc (carbons 5 and 6?), and back to carbon 1. But then there's a Cl outside the ring closure. Wait, maybe the Cl is attached to carbon 1. So the main benzene ring has Cl at position 1 and another Cl at position 2? That would be adjacent. Hmm. But the substituent NC(...) is in the middle of the ring. Let me try to visualize. Alternatively, maybe the main benzene has Cls at positions 1 and 4 (para) or something else. This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the main benzene in Molecule B has two Cls: one on the first carbon (from the branch) and another on the sixth carbon (from the end). Let me try numbering. The main ring is written as c1(c(Cl)cc(NC(...))cc1)Cl. So, starting with c1 (1), then a branch: c(Cl) (this would be carbon 2, attached to Cl), then cc (carbons 3 and 4), then the substituent NC(...) attached to carbon 4, then cc (carbons 5 and 6), and back to carbon 1. Then the Cl at the end is attached to carbon 1. So the main benzene has Cls on carbons 2 and 1? That would be adjacent, making them ortho. But that's possible. Then the substituent NC(...) is on carbon 4. Wait, but the SMILES is written as c1(c(Cl)cc(NC(...))cc1)Cl. So after the branch, we have cc, which would be carbons 3 and 4. Then the substituent NC(...) is on carbon 4. Then cc1 would be carbons 5 and 6, connecting back to carbon 1. So the main benzene has Cls on carbons 2 (from the branch) and 1 (from the ending Cl). That would be adjacent Cls, which is possible. Then the substituent on carbon 4 is NC(...).\n\nLooking at the substituent in Molecule B: NC(Nc2nnc(s2)-c2ccc(N)cc2)=O. Let's parse this. The substituent is NC(...)=O. The ... part is (Nc2nnc(s2)-c2ccc(N)cc2). So the N is connected to a c2 ring. The c2 ring is nnc(s2)-c2ccc(N)cc2. Wait, this part is a bit complex. Let's break it down. The substituent is Nc2nnc(s2)-c2ccc(N)cc2. So, starting with N connected to c2 (which is part of a ring). The ring is nnc(s2)-... So the ring starts with c2 (carbon 1), then n (nitrogen 2), n (nitrogen 3), c (carbon 4), and s2 (sulfur closing the ring with carbon 1). That forms a five-membered ring: C-N-N-C-S. Then there's a substituent attached to this ring: -c2ccc(N)cc2. Wait, the same c2 is used here, but that's not possible because the previous ring was already closed with s2. Wait, perhaps that's a typo, but in SMILES, each ring closure uses a unique number. So the first ring closure uses s2, and the next substituent has a benzene ring with c2, which might actually be a different number. But in the given SMILES, it's written as -c2ccc(N)cc2. So that's another benzene ring, where the substituent is attached. So the entire substituent after the N is a group connected to a five-membered ring (C-N-N-C-S) and a benzene ring with an amino group.\n\nPutting this together, the substituent in Molecule B is a urea group (NC(=O)...) connected to a nitrogen that's part of a five-membered ring (C-N-N-C-S), which is also connected to a benzene ring with an amino group.\n\nNow, comparing the two molecules. Molecule A has a benzene ring (N attached) connected to a five-membered ring (C-N-N-C-S) which is connected to a urea group (NC(=O)N...) that's attached to a benzene with two Cls (para). Molecule B has a benzene with two Cls (ortho?), connected to a urea group (NC(=O)N...) which is connected to a five-membered ring (C-N-N-C-S) attached to a benzene with an amino group.\n\nWait, the substituents might be similar but arranged differently. Let me check the connectivity. In Molecule A, the main benzene (with NH2) is connected to the five-membered ring, which is connected to the urea, which connects to the benzene with two Cls. In Molecule B, the main benzene (with two Cls) is connected to the urea, which is connected to the five-membered ring, which is connected to a benzene with NH2.\n\nSo, the core structures are similar but the positions of the substituents are swapped. The main benzene in A has NH2 and the substituent leading to the five-membered ring and urea to Cl-benzene. In B, the main benzene has Cls and the substituent leads to the urea, five-membered ring, and NH2-benzene.\n\nIf the connectivity is different, then the molecules are not the same. They would be structural isomers but not identical. Unless the SMILES can be written in a way that the order of substituents is different but the actual structure is the same. For example, if the substituents are attached in a symmetric way, but given the substituents here, it's unlikely.\n\nAnother thing to check is the position of the substituents on the benzene rings. In Molecule A, the benzene with Cls is para-substituted (positions 4 and 6?), while in Molecule B, the main benzene has Cls on adjacent positions (ortho). If that's the case, then they are different.\n\nAdditionally, the five-membered rings: in A, the substituent is attached to the urea group on the five-membered ring, while in B, the urea is attached to the nitrogen of the five-membered ring. Wait, let's see. In Molecule A: the five-membered ring (c2nnc(...)s2) has the urea group connected to the carbon in the ring. In Molecule B: the five-membered ring (c2nnc(s2)-c2ccc(N)cc2) is connected via the nitrogen (Nc2...). So the connectivity between the urea and the five-membered ring is different. In A, the urea is attached to a carbon in the ring, while in B, it's attached to a nitrogen. That would make them different structures.\n\nMoreover, the benzene with the amino group: in A, it's the main benzene (attached to the five-membered ring), while in B, it's the substituent on the five-membered ring. So the positions are swapped. Thus, the two molecules are not the same; they are structural isomers but differ in the arrangement of substituents and connectivity, leading to different structures.",

Let me start by looking at both structures carefully. \n\nFirst, Molecule A: Cc1c(NC(=O)c2ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc3ccccc3F)cc2)c(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)n1C. Let me parse this. The core seems to be a ring with substitutions. Breaking it down, there's a central ring (probably a five-membered ring since the numbering goes up to 1), with a methyl group (C), an amide group (NC=O), another carbonyl (c=O), and two nitrogens connected to a benzene ring (-c2ccccc2). The amide part is connected to a benzene ring with a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) attached to an aniline group (Nc3ccccc3F).\n\nNow, Molecule B: c1cc(NS(c2ccc(C(=O)Nc3c(n(C)n(c3=O)-c3ccccc3)C)cc2)(=O)=O)c(F)cc1. Let me parse this one too. The main ring here is a benzene (starts with c1cc...). There's a substituent on position 1 (assuming the numbering starts at the first carbon). The substituent is NS(...), which is a sulfonamide group. The sulfur is connected to another benzene ring (c2ccc(...)cc2) which has a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to an N which is part of another ring. That ring (c3c(...)C) has two nitrogens, one methyl group, a carbonyl (c3=O), and a substituent (-c3ccccc3).\n\nWait, let me compare the substituents. Both have a sulfonyl group connected to an aniline with fluorine. In Molecule A, the sulfonyl is S(=O)(=O)Nc3ccccc3F. In Molecule B, the sulfonyl is part of NS(=O)(=O) attached to a benzene ring. The fluorine is on the benzene ring in B: c(F)cc1. In A, the fluorine is on the aniline ring (c3ccccc3F). \n\nLooking at the core structure. Molecule A's central ring has a methyl, amide, carbonyl, and two nitrogens connected to benzene. Molecule B's core is a benzene ring with a sulfonamide substituent. The sulfonamide in B is connected to a benzene that has a carbonyl and a ring structure. That ring in B (c3c(n(C)n(c3=O)-c3ccccc3)C) has a methyl group, two nitrogens, a carbonyl, and a benzene substituent. \n\nWait, maybe the core structures are the same but just arranged differently in the SMILES string. SMILES can be written in different orders, so perhaps they are isomorphic. Let me try to see if the substituents are the same but written in a different order. \n\nIn A, the central ring is a five-membered ring with substitutions. Let me count the atoms: the SMILES starts with Cc1c(...), which suggests a ring with a methyl. Then there's NC(=O)..., which is an amide group attached to the ring. The c(=O)n(-c2ccccc2)n1C part suggests two nitrogens in the ring, each connected to a benzene (from the -c2ccccc2) and a methyl (C at the end). \n\nIn B, the core is a benzene ring (c1cc...cc1) with substituents. The NS(...) group is attached to position 1 (since the SMILES starts with c1cc(...)cc1). The sulfur connects to a benzene ring (c2ccc(...)cc2) which has a C(=O)N... group. That N is part of a ring (c3c(...)C), which has n(C), n(c3=O), and a benzene substituent. \n\nWait, perhaps the central rings are different. A's central ring is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens, while B's central part is a benzene ring with substituents. But maybe the five-membered ring in A is actually part of a fused system? Alternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are written in a different order but represent the same connectivity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two molecules are enantiomers or different tautomers, but SMILES usually doesn't account for that unless specified. Wait, but tautomerism can sometimes lead to different SMILES. However, in this case, looking at the functional groups, both have amides and sulfonamides, which are generally not tautomeric. \n\nLet me try to draw both structures mentally. \n\nMolecule A: A central five-membered ring (like a pyrimidine?) with substituents. The ring has a methyl (C), an amide group (NC=O), a carbonyl (C=O), and two nitrogens each connected to benzene rings. The amide group is attached to a benzene ring which has a sulfonyl group connected to another benzene ring with fluorine.\n\nMolecule B: A benzene ring with a sulfonamide group (N-SO2). The sulfonamide's nitrogen is attached to a benzene ring that has a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to an amine (N), which is part of a five-membered ring. This five-membered ring has a methyl, two nitrogens, a carbonyl, and a benzene substituent.\n\nWait, maybe the five-membered ring in A is the same as the one in B. Let's check the substituents. In A, the five-membered ring has methyl, amide, carbonyl, two nitrogens with benzene rings. In B, the five-membered ring (c3c(n(C)n(c3=O)-c3ccccc3)C) has methyl (C at the end), two nitrogens (n(C) and n(c3=O)), a carbonyl (c3=O), and a benzene substituent (-c3ccccc3). So that's similar to A's five-membered ring. \n\nBut in A, the substituents are: NC(=O) attached to a benzene with sulfonyl group. In B, the substituent on the five-membered ring is via the N, which is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O) which is part of another benzene ring (c2ccc(...)cc2). \n\nWait, perhaps the connectivity is different. Let me try to map the substituents. \n\nIn A: The central ring has a substituent NC(=O)c2ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc3ccccc3F)cc2. So the amide group is attached to a benzene (c2ccc...cc2), which has a sulfonyl group attached to an aniline (Nc3ccccc3F). \n\nIn B: The sulfonamide group is NS(=O)(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)Nc3...)cc2. The benzene (c2ccc...) has a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to N, which is part of the five-membered ring. \n\nSo perhaps the sulfonyl groups are in different positions. In A, the sulfonyl is on the benzene attached to the amide of the central ring. In B, the sulfonyl is attached to the main benzene via the N-SO2 group, and the amide is part of the five-membered ring's substituent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe these are the same groups but connected in different orders. SMILES can sometimes be written starting from different atoms, leading to different strings but the same structure. However, the connectivity here seems different. For example, in A, the sulfonamide is on the benzene attached to the amide, while in B, the sulfonamide is directly attached to the main benzene, and the amide is part of another substituent. \n\nAnother way to check is to canonicalize both SMILES and see if they match. Since I can't do that here, I have to rely on structural analysis. Let me check the substituents again. \n\nMolecule A's substituents:\n- Central five-membered ring with:\n   - Methyl (C)\n   - Amide (NC=O) connected to benzene (c2ccc...) which has sulfonyl (S(=O)(=O)Nc3ccccc3F)\n   - Carbonyl (c(=O))\n   - Two nitrogens each connected to benzene rings (-c2ccccc2)\n\nMolecule B's substituents:\n- Main benzene ring (c1cc...cc1) with:\n   - NS(=O)(=O) connected to benzene (c2ccc...) which has C(=O)N connected to a five-membered ring (c3c...C)\n   - Fluorine (c(F))\n\nThe five-membered ring in B has:\n   - Methyl (C)\n   - Two nitrogens (n(C) and n(c3=O))\n   - Carbonyl (c3=O)\n   - Benzene substituent (-c3ccccc3)\n\nComparing the substituents, both have a sulfonyl group connected to an aniline with fluorine. Wait, in A, the sulfonyl is connected to Nc3ccccc3F (fluoro benzene), while in B, the fluorine is on the main benzene (c(F)cc1). That's a key difference. So in A, the fluorine is on the aniline part of the sulfonamide, while in B, the fluorine is on the main benzene ring. That would make them different molecules because the fluorine's position is different.\n\nAdditionally, the core structures differ: A has a five-membered ring as the core, while B has a benzene ring as the main structure. The connectivity of the sulfonamide and amide groups is also different between the two. \n\nTherefore, despite having similar substituents like sulfonyl, amide, and benzene rings, the positions of these groups and the fluorine atom are different. So the two SMILES represent different molecules.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Let's start by looking at both SMILES structures closely.\n\nMolecule A is COc1cc2c(cc1OC)CC(N1CCOCC1)C2. Let's break that down. The core is a benzene ring (c1cc...). The substituents on the ring are methoxy groups (OC) at positions which I need to figure out. Then there's a cc2c(...) which suggests a fused ring or a substituent. The part CC(N1CCOCC1)C2 probably indicates a cyclopropyl group with an N-containing substituent. Wait, N1CCOCC1 is a morpholine ring, right? Because N connected to a CCOCC chain, forming a six-membered ring with oxygen. So the morpholine is attached via the nitrogen to a cyclopropane (CC...C2), which is connected to the benzene ring.\n\nMolecule B is COc1c(cc2c(CC(N3CCOCC3)C2)c1)OC. Let's parse this one. The benzene ring here is c1c(...) with substituents. The substituents are OCH3 (methoxy) groups. Then there's a cc2c(...) which again might be a fused ring or substituent. The inner part CC(N3CCOCC3)C2 is similar to molecule A\u2014so again a cyclopropane attached to a morpholine. But how are these groups positioned on the benzene ring?\n\nThe key here is to check if the connectivity and substituents are the same but written in a different order due to SMILES notation. SMILES can represent the same molecule with different atom numbering depending on how the rings are closed. So maybe the two SMILES are just different representations of the same structure.\n\nLet me try to draw both structures mentally. For Molecule A: a benzene ring with two methoxy groups (OC) at certain positions. Attached to the benzene is a cyclopropane ring (CC...C2) which is connected to a morpholine (N1CCOCC1). The cyclopropane is part of the fused system with the benzene?\n\nWait, maybe the benzene has a substituent that's a cyclopropane fused to it. Alternatively, the cyclopropane could be a bridge between two positions on the benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's a spiro compound. Hmm. Let me try to map the atoms.\n\nIn SMILES, the numbering can vary, so the same structure can be written with different atom orderings. For example, in Molecule A, the benzene ring is o-c1cc2..., and in Molecule B, it's COc1c(...)OC. The methoxy groups might be in the same positions but written in a different order.\n\nAnother approach is to canonicalize both SMILES. If they are the same, their canonical SMILES would match. Since I can't run a canonicalization tool here, I have to compare the structures manually.\n\nLooking at substituents: both molecules have two methoxy groups (COc... and ...OC). The morpholine ring (N-CCOCC) is present in both. The cyclopropane part (CC...C2) is also in both. The question is whether the positions of the substituents are the same.\n\nIn Molecule A: the benzene ring starts with COc1cc2c(cc1OC)... So the first atom (1) is OCH3. Then positions 1, 2, 3, etc. Let's imagine the benzene ring: positions 1 has OCH3, position 2 is connected to the next part (cc2...), then position 2 is part of a fused ring or substituent. The part c(cc1OC) suggests that when you go back to position 1 (since cc1OC is the same as positions 4 and 5?), maybe there's another OCH3 at position 4. Wait, SMILES notation can be a bit confusing. Let's parse again:\n\nCOc1cc2c(cc1OC)CC(N1CCOCC1)C2.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- COc1: methoxy attached to position 1 of benzene ring (atom 1 is OCH3).\n- c c2: next two carbons (positions 2 and 3) are part of the benzene ring.\n- c(cc1OC): this part is a bit tricky. The 'c' here is part of the benzene ring, but maybe this is a substituent. The 'cc1OC' would refer to positions 4 and 5, then back to position 1 (OCH3 again?), but that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring is numbered such that after the initial COc1, the next atoms are 2 and 3, and then the c(cc1OC) implies that from atom 3, there's a substituent that connects back to position 1 with another OCH3. That would mean positions 1 and 4 have OCH3 groups, but that's a para arrangement. Wait, but SMILES strings can be written with different starting points, so maybe the two methoxy groups are adjacent (ortho) or para.\n\nIn Molecule B: COc1c(cc2c(...)c1)OC. So the benzene starts with COc1 (position 1: OCH3), then the next carbon (position 2) has a substituent: c(cc2c(...)). Then position 6 (since the SMILES is COc1c(...)OC) would have another OCH3. So positions 1 and 6 are OCH3? But benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 6 would be adjacent (if it's a six-membered ring). Wait, benzene has six positions. If in SMILES, the order is COc1c(...)OC, that would make the OCH3 groups at positions 1 and 6 (since after the first c1 comes the c(...), then OC is at the end of the ring closure. Wait, perhaps the benzene is written as positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If the SMILES is COc1c(...)OC, then position 1 is OCH3, position 2 is part of the substituent, and the last OC (position 6?) is another OCH3. So maybe the two OCH3 groups are in positions 1 and 6, which are adjacent (ortho), but in a benzene ring, position 1 and 6 are actually adjacent. Wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are 1-2-3-4-5-6-1. So position 1 and 2 are adjacent, 1 and 6 are adjacent. So if the two OCH3 groups are on positions 1 and 6, that's ortho. But if they are on positions 1 and 4, that's para. Alternatively, positions 1 and 3 (meta).\n\nBut how does this compare to Molecule A? In Molecule A, the benzene is written as COc1cc2c(cc1OC)... So the first OCH3 is at position 1. Then positions 2 and 3 are carbons. Then comes a branch: c(cc1OC). The 'cc1OC' would be positions 4 and 5, leading back to position 1 (OCH3), which would mean position 5 is OCH3 again? Wait, that can't be. Maybe the 'cc1OC' refers to positions 4 and 5 of the benzene ring, but then the OCH3 would be at position 5. But that would make two OCH3 groups at positions 1 and 5, which is meta. But in the SMILES notation, the order can sometimes be a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for Molecule A is COc1cc2c(cc1OC)..., which after the first three atoms (positions 1, 2, 3), the next part is a branch starting at position 3. The c(cc1OC) would mean that from position 3, there's a substituent that includes positions 4 and 5, leading back to position 1 with another OCH3. That would imply that positions 1 and 5 have OCH3 groups, which are meta (positions 1 and 3 would be meta, but 1 and 5 are adjacent to 6 and 4, so maybe para? Wait, in a benzene ring, position 1 and 4 are para. Position 1 and 5 are not directly opposite. Let me think: numbering a benzene as 1-2-3-4-5-6, position 1 is opposite to 4. So if positions 1 and 5 have OCH3, that's two positions apart (1,5 are two carbons away, which is meta). Wait, 1 to 2 is adjacent, 1 to 3 is meta (two away), 1 to 4 is para. So if in Molecule A, OCH3 is at 1 and 5, that's meta. But in Molecule B, OCH3 is at 1 and 6, which are adjacent. Wait, that would mean the substituents are in different positions, making the molecules different. But maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES notation is such that the branching doesn't affect the actual positions. SMILES can be written with different starting points and directions, so the same molecule can have different SMILES strings. For example, a benzene ring with substituents can be written starting at any position and traversing clockwise or counter-clockwise, leading to different SMILES but the same structure.\n\nSo the key is whether the two SMILES strings, when canonicalized, would be identical. Since I can't run a tool here, I have to mentally check if the substituents are in equivalent positions.\n\nAnother approach: look for the substituents and their positions. Both molecules have two methoxy groups and a morpholine-connected cyclopropane. The question is whether the methoxy groups are in the same relative positions and the cyclopropane-morpholine group is attached in the same position.\n\nIn Molecule A: the benzene ring has OCH3 at position 1 and another OCH3 (from the cc1OC part). Wait, in the part c(cc1OC), the 'cc1OC' would be positions 4 and 5. So position 4 is connected to OCH3. So OCH3 at positions 1 and 4 (para). Then the cyclopropane-morpholine group is attached at position 3 (from the cc2c(...) part).\n\nIn Molecule B: the benzene starts with OCH3 at position 1, then at position 2 is a substituent that includes the cyclopropane-morpholine group, and the last OCH3 is at position 6. So OCH3 at 1 and 6 (adjacent), and the substituent at position 2. But in a benzene ring, substituents at 1 and 6 are adjacent, which would be ortho. If in Molecule A they are para (1 and 4), then the molecules are different. However, if the SMILES for Molecule B actually has OCH3 at positions 1 and 4 (para), but written differently, then they are the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the SMILES for Molecule B is written in a way that the OCH3 groups are at positions 1 and 4. Let me parse it again:\n\nMolecule B: COc1c(cc2c(CC(N3CCOCC3)C2)c1)OC.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- COc1: position 1 is OCH3.\n- c(...)OC: the benzene ring closes with OC at the end, so the last atom (position 6?) is OCH3.\n- The inner part is cc2c(...)c1. So starting at position 2 of the benzene ring (since the first is position 1: OCH3), then position 2 has a substituent that starts with cc2... So maybe a fused ring or substituent. The cc2c(...) would be a cyclopropane again, attached to morpholine. But how does the positioning go?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the benzene ring in Molecule B is numbered such that OCH3 groups are at positions 1 and 4 (para), but written as positions 1 and 6 due to SMILES traversal direction. For example, if you traverse the benzene ring starting at position 1, go to 2, then 3, then 4, 5, 6, back to 1. But SMILES can be written in a different order. If in Molecule B, the traversal is 1 -> 2 -> substituent -> then back to 6 (OC), that might place OCH3 at 1 and 6, but in reality, that's adjacent. But if the actual structure has OCH3 at 1 and 4, then the SMILES would need to reflect that, perhaps through branching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the key is that despite different SMILES strings, the actual arrangement of substituents is the same. For example, two methoxy groups para to each other and the cyclopropane-morpholine group in a specific position. If that's the case, then the molecules are the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES strings are different because the substituents are in different positions, making them different molecules.\n\nAnother way to think: the order of substituents in SMILES can vary, but the actual connectivity matters. If both molecules have two methoxy groups para to each other and the morpholine-cyclopropane group attached at a certain position, then they are the same. Otherwise, not.\n\nLet me try to sketch both:\n\nMolecule A: Benzene ring with OCH3 at 1 and 4 (para). Attached to position 3 (assuming the cc2 part starts at position 3), there's a cyclopropane connected to morpholine.\n\nMolecule B: Benzene with OCH3 at 1 and 6 (adjacent). Attached to position 2 is the cyclopropane-morpholine group.\n\nIn that case, the substituents are in different positions, so the molecules are different.\n\nBut wait, maybe the way the SMILES is written for Molecule B actually results in OCH3 at positions 1 and 4. Because the benzene ring is written as COc1c(...)OC. Let's see: the benzene starts with COc1 (position 1: OCH3), then the next atom is position 2: c(...), then position 3, 4, 5, 6: OC. So position 6 is OCH3. So OCH3 at 1 and 6, which are adjacent. That's ortho.\n\nBut in Molecule A, OCH3 at 1 and 4 (para). So if that's the case, then the molecules are different because the substituents are in different positions.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the positions. Let me try to imagine the benzene ring for Molecule B:\n\nCOc1c(...)OC. The benzene ring has six atoms. The first is OCH3 (position 1). The next atom is position 2, which has a substituent (cc2c(...)). Then positions 3,4,5, and 6. The last OC is at position 6. So OCH3 at 1 and 6. That's adjacent (ortho). But in Molecule A, OCH3 at 1 and 4 (para). So different substitution patterns, making the molecules different.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be No. But wait, I need to be careful. Because SMILES can be written with different starting points and directions. For example, if you rotate the benzene ring, positions can change. So maybe the OCH3 groups are actually para in both cases, but written differently in SMILES.\n\nFor example, in Molecule B, if the benzene ring is written starting at OCH3 (position 1), then the substituent is at position 2, and the next OCH3 is at position 5. Wait, but how does the numbering work? Let's think: the SMILES for the benzene in Molecule B is COc1c(cc2c(...)c1)OC. The ring closure is c1), so the first atom is position 1 (OCH3), then position 2 is the c(...), then position 3 is the cc2..., position 4 is part of that substituent, position 5 is c(...), and position 6 is OC. So OCH3 at 1 and 6. But in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent. So that's ortho. While in Molecule A, OCH3 at 1 and 4 (para). So different substitution patterns.\n\nBut wait, maybe the substituent in Molecule A is not at position 4. Let me re-express Molecule A's SMILES: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)CC(...)C2. The benzene ring starts with OCH3 at position 1. Then positions 2 and 3 are carbons. Then position 3 is connected to a branch: c(cc1OC). The 'cc1OC' here means that starting from position 3's branch, there are two carbons (positions 4 and 5 of the benzene?), leading back to position 1 (OCH3). So the OCH3 is at position 1 and 5? Wait, that would make positions 1 and 5 (meta). But in benzene, 1 and 5 are not para. Para is 1 and 4. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the branch in Molecule A's SMILES is indicating that from position 3 of the benzene, there's a substituent which is a carbon connected to another carbon (the 'cc1OC' part), which then connects back to position 1. But that might form a fused ring. For example, a naphthalene-like system, but with a cyclopropane.\n\nAlternatively, the 'cc2c(...)' part in Molecule A is forming a fused cyclopropane ring. So the benzene is fused to a cyclopropane, which is connected to the morpholine. In that case, the positions of the OCH3 groups would be on the benzene ring, and the cyclopropane is fused at positions 2 and 3 (or similar). Then the OCH3 groups would be at positions 1 and 4 (para), and the fused cyclopropane is at positions 2-3.\n\nIn Molecule B, the benzene has OCH3 at positions 1 and 6 (adjacent), and the cyclopropane-morpholine substituent is at position 2. If that's the case, the molecules are different.\n\nBut wait, maybe the cyclopropane in both cases is a bridge between two positions on the benzene, making the structure a bicyclic system. For example, a benzene ring with a bridge between positions 2 and 3, forming a bicyclo structure. If that's the case, then the OCH3 positions would be para (1 and 4) in both molecules, but written differently in SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are just different representations of the same structure due to different traversal orders.\n\nGiven the complexity, I might need to conclude that they are the same if the substituents are in equivalent positions, but different if not. Since the OCH3 groups in Molecule A are para (positions 1 and 4) and in Molecule B are ortho (1 and 6), they are different. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: maybe the SMILES for Molecule B's benzene ring is actually numbered such that the OCH3 groups are para. For example, if the SMILES is written in a way that the ring starts at a different position, making the OCH3 groups appear in para positions. For example, if the benzene ring in Molecule B is numbered such that the OCH3 groups are at positions 1 and 4, but the SMILES string is written in a way that starts at a different position, leading to the OC being at a different spot in the string. But without canonicalization, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are actually different representations of the same molecule. For example, the branching in the SMILES could be rearranged but refer to the same structure.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the correct approach is to recognize that SMILES can be written in different ways but represent the same molecule. If the connectivity is the same, then they are the same. To check that, perhaps both SMILES have two methoxy groups para to each other and the cyclopropane-morpholine group attached in the same position, but the SMILES strings are written with different atom numbering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cyclopropane-morpholine group is attached in the same relative position relative to the methoxy groups.\n\nGiven the complexity, and without a tool to canonicalize, I might need to make a judgment call. But considering the SMILES structures, I think they might actually be the same molecule. Because the substituents are all present in both, and the branching might be due to different starting points in the SMILES notation. For example, the OCH3 groups could be para, and the morpholine group attached in the same position, but written differently.\n\nWait, another approach: count the number of each atom and bonds. Both molecules have the same molecular formula. Let's check:\n\nMolecule A: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)CC(N1CCOCC1)C2.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- CO is OCH3 (count: 2 OCH3 groups, as there are two OC in the SMILES).\n- The benzene ring (6 carbons).\n- The cyclopropane (2 carbons from CC...C2, and one from the benzene? Or three carbons in total for the cyclopropane? Maybe two from CC and one from C2).\n- The morpholine ring (N connected to CCOCC: so 1 N, 4 C, 1 O).\n\nWait, the morpholine ring is N-C-C-O-C-C, forming a six-membered ring.\n\nSo the molecular formula would be:\n\nEach OCH3 contributes C, 3 H, O.\n\nBenzene: 6 C.\n\nCyclopropane: 3 C (assuming it's a cyclopropane ring).\n\nMorpholine: C4H9NO (since morpholine is C4H9NO).\n\nBut maybe the overall formula is the same for both molecules.\n\nAlternatively, the exact count may vary, but given that the SMILES strings both have two OCH3 groups, a benzene, a cyclopropane, and a morpholine, their molecular formulas would be the same. However, structural isomers would have the same formula but different structures.\n\nBut the question is whether they are the same molecule, not isomers.\n\nGiven that both have the same substituents (two OCH3, morpholine-cyclopropane), the key is their positions. If the positions are the same, then yes; otherwise, no.\n\nConsidering the difficulty in parsing the exact positions without a tool, but knowing that SMILES can represent the same structure in different ways, I think these two SMILES might be different representations of the same molecule. Therefore, the answer is Yes.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggested that the OCH3 positions might be different. I'm conflicted here. Another angle: the SMILES strings may have different branching but the same structure. For example, the part after the benzene in Molecule A is cc2c(cc1OC)..., which could be equivalent to the part in Molecule B: cc2c(...)c1)OC.\n\nAlternatively, the cyclopropane and morpholine are attached in the same way relative to the OCH3 groups.\n\nI think I need to make a decision. Given that SMILES can vary in notation but represent the same structure, and considering that both have two OCH3 groups and the same other substituents, it's possible they are the same. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine if Molecule A and Molecule B are the same based on their SMILES strings. First, I'll recall that SMILES notation can represent the same molecule in different ways due to the order of atoms or different starting points. So, the key is to parse both SMILES and see if they describe the same structure.\n\nStarting with Molecule A: Cc1c(F)ccc(C(=O)Nc2cc(C(=O)O)ccc2N2CCN(C)CC2)c1Cl\n\nBreaking it down: The core is a benzene ring (c1...c1Cl). The substituents on the ring are a methyl group (C), a fluorine (F), a chlorine (Cl), and a carbonyl-linked group (C(=O)N...). The N is connected to another benzene ring (c2) which has a carboxyl group (C(=O)O) and a piperazine-like ring (N2CCN(C)CC2). The second benzene ring (c2) has substituents in positions that are part of the ring structure.\n\nNow Molecule B: c1(cc(ccc1N1CCN(C)CC1)C(O)=O)NC(=O)c1ccc(c(c1Cl)C)F\n\nParsing this: The main benzene here is written with a different starting point. The ring starts with a connection to the NC(=O) group. The substituents include a fluorine (F), a methyl group (C), chlorine (Cl), and the same carbonyl-amino group. The other part is a benzene ring attached via the amino group (N), which has a carboxyl group (C(O)=O) and the piperazine ring (N1CCN(C)CC1). \n\nI need to check if the connectivity is the same. The main differences could be the order of substituents on the benzene rings. Let me visualize both structures.\n\nIn Molecule A, the main benzene has substituents at positions: methyl (maybe position 1?), fluorine (position 2?), chlorine (position 6?), and the carbonyl group (position 4?). The second benzene (attached via the amide) has substituents: carboxyl at position 4 (assuming the ring is numbered starting from the amide attachment) and the piperazine at position 6.\n\nIn Molecule B, the main benzene is attached to the amide group (NC(=O)), with substituents fluorine, methyl, chlorine. The other benzene is connected via the amide's nitrogen and has the carboxyl group and piperazine. The key is to see if the substituents are on the same positions when considering the ring numbering.\n\nBut SMILES strings can start numbering from any atom, so the order might be different but the structure the same. To confirm, perhaps canonicalizing both SMILES would help. If they canonicalize to the same string, then they're the same. Since I can't run a tool here, I'll have to mentally check.\n\nAnother approach: look for the same functional groups and connectivity. Both have a benzene with F, Cl, methyl, and an amide group. The amide connects to another benzene with a carboxyl and a piperazine. The piperazine in both is N-methyl (since it's N(C) in the SMILES). The carboxyl is -C(=O)O in A and C(O)=O in B, which is the same.\n\nNow, checking the arrangement of substituents. For the main benzene in A: the order is C, F, then in the ccc (which would be positions 1, 2, and 4?), but SMILES notation can be tricky. For example, the benzene ring in A is written as c1c(F)ccc(...)c1Cl. So the first atom (position 1) is connected to the methyl (C), position 2 is F, then positions 4 is the carbonyl group. The Cl is at position 6 (since it's the closing c1Cl). \n\nIn Molecule B, the main benzene is c1(cc(ccc1...). The substituents are attached at positions where? Let's parse it step by step. The SMILES starts with c1(...), so the first atom is position 1. The groups attached are: NC(=O)c1ccc(c(c1Cl)C)F. The main benzene here is the one with NC(=O) attached. The substituents are F, Cl, methyl (C), and the amide group. The positions here might be: the amide is at position 1, then the other substituents are in positions 2 (F?), 4 (Cl?), and 5 (methyl?). Wait, perhaps the arrangement is different. Alternatively, considering that in SMILES, the branches are written in order. So for the benzene ring in B: the main ring is c1(cc(ccc1N1CCN...)) etc. But this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main difference is the position of the substituents on the benzene rings. If the substituents are on the same positions relative to each other, then the molecules are the same. For instance, if in both cases, the F is adjacent to the methyl and the Cl is opposite, then they would be the same. But if their positions are swapped, they might be different.\n\nAlternatively, since SMILES can be written starting from any atom, maybe the two SMILES are just different representations of the same structure. For example, the main benzene in A is written starting with the methyl, while in B it's starting with the amide group. So if you rotate the ring, the substituents would be in the same positions.\n\nAnother point: the piperazine rings in both are the same. Both have N-methyl groups (N(C) in the SMILES). The carboxyl groups are also the same. The amide linkage is present in both. The key is the arrangement on the benzene rings.\n\nTo check if the substituents are in the same positions, I need to map them. Let's take the main benzene in A: positions 1 (methyl), 2 (F), 4 (amide), 6 (Cl). In SMILES notation, the order of writing the substituents doesn't necessarily indicate their positions unless specified by the parentheses. So the SMILES for A is Cc1c(F)ccc(C(=O)N...)c1Cl. The first carbon (methyl) is attached to position 1. Then position 2 is F. Then the ccc (positions 3,4,5) leads to the amide at position 4. Position 6 is Cl.\n\nIn Molecule B: the main benzene is written as NC(=O)c1ccc(c(c1Cl)C)F. Let's parse this. The benzene starts with the amide group (NC(=O)) attached to position 1. Then c1ccc(...) would be positions 2,3,4,5. The substituents are at positions 4 (c(c1Cl)C) and F at position 5? Wait, the SMILES is a bit complex. Let's break it down:\n\nc1 is the benzene ring. The NC(=O) is attached to position 1. Then we have ccc(...), which would be positions 2,3,4. The next part is c(c1Cl)C)F. Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost here. Let's try again.\n\nThe SMILES for the main benzene in B is: NC(=O)c1ccc(c(c1Cl)C)F. So, the benzene ring (c1) starts at the NC(=O) group. Then we have ccc (positions 2,3,4), followed by a branch: c(c1Cl)C. Here, the c is connected to the benzene ring (position 4?), and then another c which is connected to Cl and the main ring (c1Cl). This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the benzene has substituents at positions 1 (amide), 4 (Cl and methyl?), and 5 (F). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for B is equivalent to A but written in a different order. For example, the main benzene in B starts with the amide group, so the substituents would be arranged as amide (position 1), then positions 2-6: perhaps F, methyl, Cl, etc., but the relative positions could be the same as in A when considering ring orientation.\n\nWithout visualizing, it's challenging, but perhaps the key is that both molecules have the same substituents connected in the same way. The only possible difference could be the positions of substituents on the benzene rings. If the substituents are in the same relative positions (ortho, meta, para), then the molecules are the same. If not, they're different.\n\nAnother approach: canonicalize the SMILES. If both SMILES, when canonicalized, are identical, then they're the same. Since the user can't do that here, I have to mentally check.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of each substituent. Both have one Cl, one F, one methyl, one amide group, one carboxyl, and one piperazine. So the counts match. Now, check connectivity.\n\nThe amide in A is attached to a benzene that has a carboxyl and a piperazine. The same for B. So the secondary benzene has the same groups. Now, the main benzene: in A, it's methyl, F, Cl, amide. In B, the main benzene has amide, Cl, methyl, F. But depending on their positions, this could be the same molecule.\n\nIf the main benzene in A is arranged as methyl (position 1), F (2), amide (4), Cl (6), and in B it's amide (1), F (position 2), Cl (4), methyl (6), then they would be different. But if the numbering is different but the substituents are adjacent in the same way, they could be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two SMILES are just different representations. For example, the main benzene in A starts with the methyl, while in B it starts with the amide. If the relative positions are maintained when rotating the ring, they are the same. For example, if in A the substituents are at positions 1 (methyl), 2 (F), 4 (amide), 6 (Cl), and in B the substituents are at positions 1 (amide), 2 (Cl), 4 (methyl), 6 (F), then they would be different. But if the arrangement is such that the substituents are in the same relative positions, they are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for B is a different permutation but the same structure. For example, the main benzene in B could be written starting from the amide, which would correspond to a different starting point in A but same structure.\n\nThis is quite tricky. To resolve this, maybe I can try writing both SMILES in a way that highlights the substituents' order.\n\nMolecule A: The main benzene is written as Cc1c(F)ccc(...)c1Cl. So positions:\n\n1: C (methyl)\n\n2: F\n\n3: c (part of the ring)\n\n4: c (part of the ring, but where the substituent is attached (C(=O)N...))\n\nWait, the SMILES is Cc1c(F)ccc(C(=O)N...)c1Cl. So the first atom is C (methyl) attached to position 1 of the benzene. Then position 2 is F. Then positions 3,4,5 are part of the ring (the 'ccc' part). The substituent at position 4 is C(=O)N..., and position 6 is Cl.\n\nIn Molecule B: the main benzene is written as NC(=O)c1ccc(c(c1Cl)C)F. So the benzene starts with the NC(=O) group (position 1). Then positions 2,3,4 (the 'ccc'). The substituent at position 4 is a branch: c(c1Cl)C. Wait, this is confusing. Let's parse it step by step.\n\nBreaking down B's SMILES:\n\nThe main benzene is c1(cc(ccc1N1CCN(C)CC1)C(O)=O). Wait, no\u2014the entire SMILES is c1(...)NC(=O)c1ccc(c(c1Cl)C)F. Hmm, perhaps I should split it into parts.\n\nThe entire SMILES for B is:\n\nc1(cc(ccc1N1CCN(C)CC1)C(O)=O)NC(=O)c1ccc(c(c1Cl)C)F\n\nBut maybe it's better to parse it as two benzene rings connected via the amide.\n\nThe main part after the first c1 is a benzene ring with substituents: cc(ccc1...) which would be positions 2 and 3, then positions 4-6. The substituents include N1CCN(C)CC1 (piperazine) and C(O)=O (carboxyl). Then this benzene is connected via NC(=O) to another benzene (c1ccc(...)).\n\nSo the other benzene is c1ccc(c(c1Cl)C)F. Let's parse this:\n\n- c1: benzene ring starting at position 1 (attached to the amide's N).\n- ccc: positions 2,3,4.\n- Then a branch: c(c1Cl)C. Wait, the c here is attached to position 4 of the benzene. The next part is c(c1Cl)C. So this would be a carbon (position 4) connected to another carbon (which is attached to Cl and the benzene ring (c1Cl)), and a methyl group (C). Then F is at the end.\n\nThis is quite complex. Maybe the benzene ring here is structured with Cl at position 5, methyl at position 4, and F at position 6? Or perhaps Cl at position 5, methyl at position 4, and F at position 2. Without a clear visualization, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both molecules are identical because the substituents are all the same and the connectivity is the same, just written in a different order. For example, the amide group in A is attached to the main benzene, and in B it's the same, but the SMILES starts from a different point. If the relative positions are maintained, they would be the same.\n\nAnother angle: the SMILES strings might be different due to the order of writing branches, but the actual structure is the same. For instance, the main benzene in A starts with methyl, F, then the amide, while in B it starts with the amide, then other groups. But if you rotate the ring, the substituents would be in the same positions.\n\nAssuming that the SMILES are different representations of the same molecule, the answer would be Yes. But if the substituents are in different positions (e.g., adjacent vs. opposite), then No.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to map the exact positions, I might lean towards them being the same if the substituents are all present and the connectivity (which groups are attached to which) matches. Both have the same groups attached to the same parts (amide linked to the benzene with carboxyl and piperazine, main benzene with F, Cl, methyl, and amide). The only question is the positions on the benzene rings. If the arrangement is the same, then yes. If not, no.\n\nBut without a tool, I have to make a best guess. Since SMILES can vary in notation but represent the same structure, and considering that all substituents are present in both molecules in the same connectivity (except possibly ring positions), but the arrangement might be different. However, given that the SMILES strings might just be different representations of the same molecule due to different starting points or branch orders, I think they are the same. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Let me start by recalling that SMILES notation can sometimes represent the same structure in different ways due to the order of atoms or different starting points.\n\nFirst, let's look at Molecule A: CCC(CO)Oc1cc(NCc2ccccc2)c2ncn(C(C)C)c2c1. Breaking this down, the main structure seems to have an oxygen connected to a CCC(CO) group. Then there's a benzene ring (the 'c1cc...c1' part) with substituents. The substituents include an NCc2ccccc2 group, which is a phenylmethylamine group (a benzene ring attached via a methylene to an amine). Then there's another ring part with c2ncn(C(C)C)c2. Wait, the indices here might be a bit confusing. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nMolecule B is given as c1c(cc2c(c1NCc1ccccc1)ncn2C(C)C)OC(CC)CO. Let's parse this one too. Starting with the benzene ring (c1...c1), then inside there's a substituent OC(CC)CO, which is similar to the OCCC(CO) in Molecule A but maybe in a different order. Also, there's the NCc1ccccc1 group attached, same as in A. The ring substitution also has a c2ncn(C(C)C) part here. \n\nWait, maybe the difference is in how the substituents are ordered on the benzene ring. SMILES strings can start numbering from different positions, so perhaps the order in which the substituents are listed affects the string but not the actual structure. Let me try to visualize both structures.\n\nFor Molecule A: The benzene ring (c1) has substituents at positions where? The first 'cc' after O would be positions 2 and 3, but SMILES uses a clockwise notation. The substituents are N(Cc2ccccc2), which is attached to the benzene ring. Then there's a c2ncn(C(C)C)c2 which forms a fused ring? Or maybe a substituent. Wait, the 'c2ncn(C(C)C)c2c1' part: the c2 starts at position, say, 4 of the benzene ring (c1), then forms another ring? Or maybe a substituent with a five-membered ring? Alternatively, perhaps a pyridine ring fused to the benzene? Hmm, I might need to draw this out mentally.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES: starts with c1, then a branch: c(cc2c(...)ncn2C(C)C). So, the benzene ring (c1) has at position 2 (since the first atom is c1, the next is c connected to c1) a substituent OC(CC)CO. Then, at another position, there's the NCc1ccccc1 group (but wait, here the 'c1' is reused, which is allowed in SMILES as long as the numbering is nested). The part with cc2c(...)ncn2C(C)C suggests a fused ring here. \n\nWait, perhaps both molecules are the same but written with different starting points and ring numbering. For example, the order of substituents on the benzene ring might be different in the SMILES strings, but actually the same in structure. Another possibility is that the SMILES strings are canonicalized differently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions of the substituents on the benzene ring are different, leading to different structures. For instance, if the substituents are in para or meta positions, but in SMILES, the order can sometimes represent adjacent positions depending on how the string is built.\n\nAnother thing to check is the branching. In Molecule A, we have CCC(CO)Oc1cc..., which is O connected to CCC(CO). In Molecule B, the substituent is OC(CC)CO. Let me parse that. For A: CCC(CO)O-... So that's a propyl group (CCC) with a CO (hydroxymethyl) branch. The oxygen is attached to the central carbon of the propyl chain. So the structure would be O-C(CC)(CO). For B: OC(CC)CO. That's O connected to a carbon which is connected to CC (ethyl) and CO (another hydroxymethyl group). Wait, that's the same as CCC(CO)O, right? Because CCC(CO)O would be O-C(CC)(CO). So the substituent on the oxygen is a central carbon connected to two CH2 groups (from CC and CO). So yes, that's the same as OC(CC)CO. So that part is the same.\n\nNow looking at the aromatic rings. Molecule A has a benzene ring (from the 'c1cc...c1') with substituents. The substituents are at positions where? Let's see: the 'Oc1cc(NC...)c2ncn(...)c2c1'. The benzene ring (c1) starts with O attached, then comes two carbons (cc), then a substituent NC..., then a c2 which is part of a ncn ring. Wait, maybe the benzene ring is connected to a fused ring. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe SMILES for A: O-C-... (the O from the OC(CC)CO group) connected to c1. Then the benzene ring is c1 connected to c (position 2), then another c (position 3) with substituent NCc2ccccc2 (which is a benzylamine group). Then position 4 is connected to c2, which starts a new ring: c2ncn(C(C)C)c2. So c2 is connected to n, then c, then n, then C(C)C, and then back to c2. That forms a five-membered ring? Wait, c2ncn(C(C)C)c2: that would be a five-membered ring with atoms c2, n, c, n, C(C)C? Wait, no, because the ring closure is c2 at the end. So the sequence is c2 - n - c - n - C(C)C - c2. That would form a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. But wait, the C(C)C is a tert-butyl group attached to one of the nitrogens. So the ring would be a five-membered ring with two nitrogens and a carbon connected to tert-butyl. That's a possible structure, maybe like an imidazole ring?\n\nIn Molecule B, the benzene ring (c1) has substituents. The structure is c1c(cc2c(...)ncn2C(C)C)OC(...). So starting at c1, the next c is connected to a branch: (cc2c(...)ncn2C(C)C). Then the benzene ring also has an OC(...) group. The substituent inside the branch is cc2c(...)ncn2C(C)C. Let's parse that: the benzene's c is connected to c, then c2. The c2 is part of another ring: c(...)ncn2C(C)C. So that's a ring closure back to c2. This seems similar to the five-membered ring in Molecule A. So perhaps the fused ring structure is the same in both molecules, just written with different starting points.\n\nAnother thing to check is the connectivity of the benzylamine group (NCc2ccccc2). In Molecule A, it's attached to the benzene ring via the N, then a CH2 (from Cc2...), leading to another benzene (c2ccccc2). In Molecule B, the same group is present as NCc1ccccc1. The numbering here is different (c1 vs c2), but that's just a label and doesn't affect the structure.\n\nSo putting it all together: Both molecules have an oxygen substituent connected to a propyl and hydroxymethyl group (OC(CC)CO vs CCC(CO)O), which are the same. The benzene ring has a benzylamine substituent and a fused five-membered ring with two nitrogens and a tert-butyl group. The order in which these substituents are attached might differ in the SMILES strings, but if they are in the same positions on the benzene ring, then the molecules are the same. However, if the substituents are in different positions (like para vs meta), they would be different.\n\nBut SMILES strings can represent the same molecule with different atom ordering. To confirm, perhaps the SMILES strings are canonicalized differently. Alternatively, maybe the benzene ring substituents are in different positions. Let's try to analyze the substitution pattern.\n\nIn Molecule A: The benzene ring is O-c1cc(NC...)c2... So the oxygen is at position 1, then positions 2 and 3 are carbons (the 'cc'), then position 4 has the NC group. Then position 5 is connected to the fused ring (c2ncn...). Wait, the benzene ring has six positions. Let me count:\n\nThe SMILES for A's benzene ring: O-c1cc(NC...)c2ncn(...)c2c1. The 'c1' is position 1 (with O attached). Then positions 2 and 3 are carbons (the first two 'c's in 'cc'). Then position 4 has the NC substituent. Then comes 'c2', which starts a new ring. The 'c2ncn(C(C)C)c2' part forms a ring where c2 is connected to n, then c, then n, then C(C)C, and back to c2. Then the 'c2c1' connects this back to the original benzene ring. So the fused ring is attached at position 5 of the benzene ring. Wait, maybe not. Let's imagine the benzene ring (positions 1-6). Position 1: O. Position 2: C. Position 3: C. Position 4: NC substituent. Then position 5: connected to the fused ring. Position 6: connects back to position 1. Hmm, perhaps the fused ring is between positions 4 and 5, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fused ring is a five-membered ring attached to the benzene. For example, the benzene ring has a substituent that is part of another ring. Let's say the benzene ring is connected to a pyrrole-like ring. But the actual structure isn't clear without drawing.\n\nIn Molecule B's SMILES: c1c(cc2c(...)ncn2C(C)C)OC(...). The benzene ring starts at c1, then the next atom is c connected to a branch. The branch is (cc2c(...)ncn2C(C)C). The first c in the branch is connected to another c, then to c2. The c2 is part of a ring: c(...)ncn2C(C)C. Then OC(...) is another substituent on the benzene ring.\n\nIt's possible that the substituents on the benzene ring in both molecules are arranged in the same order but written in a different sequence in the SMILES strings. Since SMILES strings can start numbering from any atom and traverse the ring in any direction, two different SMILES can represent the same molecule.\n\nTo check if they are the same, perhaps the best approach is to convert both SMILES to their canonical forms using a tool like RDKit. However, since I can't run code here, I need to analyze manually.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the SMILES strings might be identical when canonicalized. For example, the substituents might be in the same positions, just written in a different order in the string.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the SMILES for Molecule B reuses the index c1 for the benzene ring in the NCc1ccccc1 part, which is allowed as the indices are scoped within the branch. That part is the same as NCc2ccccc2 in Molecule A.\n\nPutting this all together, it's likely that these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule, just written with different starting points and ring numbering. The substituents on the benzene ring are in the same positions, and the fused ring structure is identical. The different order in the SMILES string is due to the way the rings are numbered and the starting atom chosen.",

The user provided Molecule A: CCOC(=O)CC(NC(=O)C1CCCN1)C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC and Molecule B: C1(C(NC(C2CCCN2)=O)CC(OCC)=O)OC2OC(OC2C1OC)(C)C. \n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing each SMILES string to understand their structures. SMILES can sometimes be written in different ways but still represent the same molecule due to ring numbering or branch ordering. So my task is to parse both and check if they are isomorphic.\n\nLooking at Molecule A: The structure starts with CCOC(=O)CC..., which is an ethyl group (CCO-) attached to a carbonyl (C=O). Then there's a CC chain connected to an NC(=O) group. The NC(=O) is attached to a cyclohexyl group (C1CCCN1), which is a five-membered ring? Wait, C1CCCN1 would be a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. Let me count: positions 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (C), 5 (N), connected back to position 1. So that's a pyrrolidine ring, right? Because pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four CH2 groups and one NH. So that part is NC(=O) attached to pyrrolidine.\n\nThen in Molecule A, after that, there's C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. This seems like a sugar-like structure. The C1 is part of a ring. Breaking it down: C1O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1-O-C. Wait, maybe it's a tetrahydropyran ring with substituents? Let me try to draw this mentally. The ring is formed by C1-O-C2-O... Hmm, maybe a dioxane derivative? Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic structure with two oxygen atoms. Let's parse it step by step. The part C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC: Starting at C1, connected to O, then C2, then O, then C(C)(C) (which is a tert-butyl group?), then O, then C2 (forming a ring between C2 and O?), then back to C1, then O, and another C. Maybe a cyclic structure with two oxygen atoms, creating a ring. It's a bit complex, but perhaps a 1,4-dioxane ring or similar, but with substituents like a tert-butyl group.\n\nNow, Molecule B: C1(C(NC(C2CCCN2)=O)CC(OCC)=O)OC2OC(OC2C1OC)(C)C. Let's parse this. Starting with C1, which is part of a ring. The main chain attached to C1 includes a C(NC(...)) group. The NC(...) is NC(C2CCCN2)=O, which again is the pyrrolidine ring attached to a carbonyl, similar to Molecule A. Then CC(OCC)=O: this is a CC chain where one carbon is attached to an OCC group (ethoxy) and a carbonyl. So that part would be -CH2-C(O)OEt. \n\nThe rest of Molecule B is OC2OC(OC2C1OC)(C)C. So the oxygen connected to C2, which is part of a ring. The OC2OC(...) suggests a ring here as well. The substituents here are (OC2C1OC) and (C)C (another tert-butyl group?). The OC2C1OC part connects back to the original C1 ring, forming a bridge perhaps. \n\nComparing the two SMILES, both have similar components: the ethyl ester (OCC=O), the pyrrolidine carboxamide (NC(=O)C1CCCN1), and a complex ether ring structure with tert-butyl groups. The key is to check if the arrangement of these groups is the same despite the different SMILES notation.\n\nSMILES can vary in how rings are closed and the order of branches. For example, the order in which substituents are listed or the numbering of rings can differ but still represent the same structure. So I need to check if the connectivity is identical.\n\nLooking at the main chains: Molecule A has CCOC(=O)CC(...), which is ethyl-O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(...). Molecule B has CC(OCC)=O, which is CH2-C(=O)-OCH2CH3. Wait, that's the same as ethyl ester. So OCC is ethoxy, so OCH2CH3. So in Molecule B, the ester is written as CC(OCC)=O, which is equivalent to C(OCC)=O attached to a CH2. So that's the same as the ethyl ester group in A. So the ethyl ester part is present in both.\n\nThe next part is the NC(=O) attached to pyrrolidine. Both have that, so that's a match.\n\nThen the cyclic ether parts. In Molecule A, the part after that is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. In Molecule B, it's OC2OC(OC2C1OC)(C)C. Let's try to parse these.\n\nIn Molecule A: C1 is part of a ring. Starting at C1, connected to O, then C2, O, then C(C)(C) (tert-butyl), O, C2 (closing the ring between C2 and O?), then back to C1, then O and another C. Wait, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring with two oxygen atoms, like a dioxane ring. For example, the ring could be C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1. Wait, but that might not form a proper ring. Let me try to write it as:\n\nC1 (connected to O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1-O-C). Maybe the ring is C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2, which would form a ring if C2 is connected back. But that would make a five-membered ring? Alternatively, perhaps C1 is connected to O, then C2, which is connected to O, then C(C)(C), then O, then back to C2, forming a ring between C2 and O? That might create a three-membered ring, which is unlikely. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should try to draw both structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a tool to convert SMILES to structures would help, but since I'm doing this manually, I need to parse each part carefully.\n\nIn Molecule A's cyclic part: C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. Let's break it down:\n\n- C1 is connected to O, then to C2.\n- C2 is connected to O, then to C(C)(C) (tert-butyl), then O, then back to C2 (ring closure?), then to C1 (another ring closure?), and then O-C.\n\nWait, the SMILES notation uses numbers to indicate ring closures. So C1...C1 would form a ring between the first and second C1. Similarly, C2...C2 forms another ring.\n\nWait, in Molecule A: The sequence is C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1-O-C. So C1 is connected to O, then C2. Then C2 is connected to O, then to C(C)(C), then O, then back to C2 (ring closure between the second C2 and the O?), then back to C1 (ring closure between C1 and the O?), then O-C.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has two rings: one involving C1 and another involving C2. Let's try to parse it again.\n\nStarting at C1:\n\nC1 (connected to O) -> C2 (connected to O) -> C(C)(C) (tert-butyl) -> O -> C2 (ring closure here between the second O and C2?), then back to C1 (ring closure between C1 and the O after C2?), then O-C.\n\nThis might form a fused ring system. Alternatively, perhaps a spiro ring system. For example, a central atom connected to two rings. But without drawing it, it's hard to tell.\n\nIn Molecule B's cyclic part: OC2OC(OC2C1OC)(C)C. Let's parse this:\n\nO connected to C2, which is part of a ring. C2 is connected to O, then to a branch: OC2C1OC. Wait, that might be a ring closure. Let me see:\n\nThe part OC2OC(...) starts with O connected to C2. Then C2 is connected to O, which is connected to a branch (OC2C1OC) and (C)C (tert-butyl). The OC2C1OC part: O connected to C2 (which is part of the previous ring?), then C1, which is connected to O and C. So perhaps C1 is part of another ring.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Maybe the key is to check if the substituents and connectivity are the same, regardless of the SMILES string's ordering.\n\nAnother approach: canonicalize both SMILES. Since SMILES can be written in different ways but represent the same structure when canonicalized. However, since I can't run a canonicalization algorithm here, I need to mentally check.\n\nAlternatively, check if the molecular formulas are the same. Let's count the atoms.\n\nMolecule A: Let's count each element.\n\nCCOC(=O)CC(NC(=O)C1CCCN1)C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- CCO: 2 C, 1 O\n- C(=O): 1 C, 1 O\n- CC: 2 C\n- NC(=O): 1 N, 1 C, 1 O\n- C1CCCN1: 4 C (since C1 is counted once), 1 N. Wait, C1 is part of the ring: C1-C-C-C-N-C1. That's 5 atoms in the ring (4 C and 1 N). So that's 4 C and 1 N.\n- Then the rest: C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. Let's parse this:\n\nC1 (part of a ring) connected to O, C2 (ring), O, C(C)(C) (3 C), O, C2 (ring closure), C1 (ring closure), O, C.\n\nSo for the cyclic part:\n\nC1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1-O-C. Breaking down:\n\nC1: 1 C\nO: 1 O\nC2: 1 C\nO: 1 O\nC: 1 C\n(C)(C): 2 C (but the central C is already counted, so 3 C in total here)\nO: 1 O\nC2: ring closure (no new atoms)\nC1: ring closure (no new atoms)\nO: 1 O\nC: 1 C\n\nSo in this part: 1 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 3 (C from C(C)(C)) + 1 (C at the end) = 6 C. O: 1 (O) +1 (O) +1 (O) +1 (O) =4 O. Plus the O from the previous OC.\n\nWait, this is getting too time-consuming. Let's try to count all atoms in Molecule A:\n\nCCOC(=O)CC(NC(=O)C1CCCN1)C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC\n\nCount C:\n\n- CCO: 2 C\n- C(=O): 1 C\n- CC: 2 C\n- NC(=O): 1 C\n- C1CCCN1: 4 C (since C1 is part of the ring, which has 4 C and 1 N)\n- C1OC2OC(...): The cyclic part. The ring here has C1 and C2 as part of the rings. Let's see:\n\nC1 is part of a ring (C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1-O-C). So C1 is connected to O, C2, O, and back. The C(C)(C) is a central C connected to three CH3 groups? Wait, no, C(C)(C) is a C connected to two C atoms (as branches), but in this context, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group. Wait, the SMILES is OC(C)(C), which is O-C(C)(C). So that's a C connected to three methyl groups? No, the C(C)(C) would be a central carbon connected to three other carbons, making a tert-butyl group if those are CH3. But in this case, the SMILES is OC(C)(C), which is O connected to a central C, which is connected to two Cs (branches) and another C (from the OC). Wait, maybe it's O-C(C)(C) which is O connected to a carbon that has two methyl groups (if the Cs are part of branches). But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the entire SMILES string and count each atom.\n\nMolecule A:\n\nC C O C(=O) C C (N C(=O) C1 C C C C N1) C1 O C2 O C (C)(C) O C2 C1 O C\n\nBreaking down each segment:\n\n- CCOC(=O): 2 C (from CC), 1 O (from O), 1 C (from C(=O)), 1 O (from =O)\n- CC: 2 C\n- NC(=O): 1 N, 1 C, 1 O\n- C1CCCN1: C1 (1 C), followed by C C C N, making 4 C and 1 N, but since C1 is part of the ring, the total here is 4 C (C1 is counted once) and 1 N\n- Then C1 (another ring start) O C2 O C (C)(C) O C2 C1 O C\n\nSo for the cyclic part:\n\nC1 O C2 O C (C)(C) O C2 C1 O C\n\nC1: 1 C\nO: 1 O\nC2: 1 C\nO: 1 O\nC: 1 C\n(C)(C): two C atoms (branches)\nO: 1 O\nC2: ring closure (no new atom)\nC1: ring closure (no new atom)\nO: 1 O\nC: 1 C\n\nSo in the cyclic part: 1 (C1) +1 (C2) +1 (C) +2 (from branches) +1 (C at end) =6 C. But wait, the branches are part of the C atom in C(C)(C), so that's one C with two branches (each a C). So the C(C)(C) is one central C connected to two Cs (so three Cs in total for that group: the central one and two branches). So adding that: 3 Cs here.\n\nSo the cyclic part: C1 (1) + C2 (1) + C (central, 1) + 2 C (branches) + C (end) =1+1+1+2+1=6 C? Wait, but the C(C)(C) is one C connected to two Cs, but those Cs are part of the branches. So total for that part: 1 (central C) + 2 (branches) =3 C. Then the rest of the cyclic part: C1, C2, O's, and the final C.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's try to list all atoms in Molecule A:\n\nCarbon atoms:\n\n- CCOC(=O): 2 (from CC) + 1 (C=O) =3 C\n- CC: 2 C\n- NC(=O): 1 C (attached to N)\n- C1CCCN1: 4 C (C1, then 3 more Cs)\n- Then the cyclic part: C1 (another C1), C2, C (central in C(C)(C)), two Cs from C(C)(C) branches, and the final C. So 1+1+1+2+1=6 C\n- The O's are oxygens, not counted for C.\n\nTotal C in A: 3 +2 +1 +4 +6 =16 C?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me try again.\n\nMolecule A's SMILES:\n\nCCOC(=O)CC(NC(=O)C1CCCN1)C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC\n\nBreaking into parts:\n\n1. CCOC(=O): ethyl group (C-C-O) connected to carbonyl (C=O). So 3 C (C-C-O) and the C in C=O. Wait, CCO is C-C-O, then C(=O) is another C. So total here: 3+1=4 C.\n\n2. CC: two more C (so 4+2=6 C so far).\n\n3. NC(=O): the C in the carbonyl (so 1 C, total 7).\n\n4. C1CCCN1: the ring. C1 is one C, then three Cs (C-C-C), then N, then back to C1. So total C here: 4 (C1 and three Cs) +1 N. So C count: 7+4=11.\n\n5. Then C1 (another ring) OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC.\n\nBreaking this part:\n\nC1 O C2 O C(C)(C) O C2 C1 O C.\n\nSo:\n\n- C1: 1 C (total 12)\n- C2: 1 C (13)\n- C in C(C)(C): 1 C (14)\n- The two C in the branches: 2 C (15 and 16)\n- The final C: 1 C (17)\n\nBut wait, the C(C)(C) is a central C connected to two Cs. So that's three Cs here (central and two branches). So that part adds 3 C. So from the cyclic part:\n\nC1 (1) + C2 (1) + C(C)(C) (3) + final C (1) = 6 C. So total C so far: 11 (from previous) +6=17 C.\n\nOxygens:\n\n1. CCOC(=O): O in CCO, O in C(=O) \u2192 2 O.\n2. CC: no O.\n3. NC(=O): O in carbonyl \u2192 1 O (total 3).\n4. C1CCCN1: no O.\n5. Cyclic part: O in C1-O, O in C2-O, O in O-C(C)(C), O in O-C2, O in O-C. So that's 5 O. Total O: 3 +5=8 O.\n\nNitrogen:\n\n1. NC(=O): 1 N.\n2. C1CCCN1: 1 N. Total N: 2.\n\nNow, Molecule B: C1(C(NC(C2CCCN2)=O)CC(OCC)=O)OC2OC(OC2C1OC)(C)C\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nC1(...)OC2OC(...) etc.\n\nCount C:\n\n1. C1(...): the main ring C1 has substituents:\n\n- C(NC(...)=O: the C attached to N.\n- CC(OCC)=O: C attached to OCC and =O.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nC1 (C(...)): the substituents on C1 are:\n\n- C(NC(C2CCCN2)=O: this is a carbon attached to N (which is attached to C(C2CCCN2)=O). The C2CCCN2 part is a pyrrolidine ring (similar to Molecule A), so 4 C and 1 N.\n- CC(OCC)=O: this is a carbon attached to another C (which is attached to OCC and =O). OCC is ethoxy, so 2 C here.\n\nThen the main chain continues with OC2OC(...)(C)C.\n\nSo, counting C:\n\nC1 (1) + substituents:\n\n- C(NC(...))=O: 1 C\n- NC(...)=O: 1 C (from C(...)), which is part of C2CCCN2: 4 C\n- CC(OCC)=O: 2 C (the two Cs in CC)\n- OCC: 2 C (ethyl)\n- OC2OC(...): O connected to C2 (part of a ring)\n- OC2C1OC: O connected to C2, which is part of the ring, connected to C1, O, and C\n- (C)C: 2 C (tert-butyl?)\n\nThis is very complex, but let's try:\n\nMolecule B's SMILES: C1(C(...))OC2OC(...)(C)C\n\nBreaking down:\n\nC1 has substituents:\n\n- C(NC(C2CCCN2)=O): 1 C attached to N, which is attached to C(C2CCCN2)=O. The C2 here is part of a pyrrolidine ring (C2CCCN2), which has 4 C and 1 N.\n\n- CC(OCC)=O: the C attached to C(OCC)=O. OCC is ethyl, so 2 C here.\n\nThen the main chain is OC2OC(...)(C)C. The OC2 is part of a ring. The substituents on C2 are OC2C1OC and (C)C.\n\nThe OC2C1OC part connects back to C1 and O, forming a ring. The (C)C is a tert-butyl group (if each C is a methyl).\n\nThis is quite involved, but let's try to count all C atoms:\n\nMain chain starting with C1:\n\n- C1: 1\n- substituent C(...): 1 C\n- NC(...): 1 C (in C(C2CCCN2))\n- C2CCCN2: 4 C (pyrrolidine)\n- CC(OCC)=O: 2 C (the two Cs in CC)\n- OCC: 2 C (ethyl)\n- OC2OC(...): C2 is part of a ring\n- OC2C1OC: C2 here is part of the ring connected to C1\n- (C)C: 3 C (central C plus two branches)\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming, but I need to compare the molecular formulas.\n\nIf the molecular formulas (count of C, H, O, N) are the same, they might be the same molecule. If different, definitely not.\n\nFrom Molecule A's count earlier: C:17, O:8, N:2.\n\nFor Molecule B:\n\nLet's count:\n\nC1(C(...))OC2OC(...)(C)C.\n\nBreaking into parts:\n\nC1(...)OC2... \n\n- C1 is part of a ring. The substituents on C1 include a C(NC(...))=O group and a CC(OCC)=O group.\n\nThe C(NC(...))=O group:\n\n- 1 C (attached to N)\n- N attached to C(C2CCCN2)=O: the C here is part of the pyrrolidine (C2CCCN2: 4 C, 1 N)\n- So this part contributes 1 +1 (from C in C(...))=O) +4 (pyrrolidine) =6 C, 1 N.\n\nThe CC(OCC)=O group:\n\n- CC: 2 C\n- OCC: 2 C (ethyl)\n- =O: no C\n- So this part contributes 2 +2 =4 C.\n\nThe main C1 and the ring structure:\n\nC1 is connected to O, then C2 in the ring. The OC2OC(...)(C)C part:\n\n- C2 is part of a ring. The substituents on C2 include OC2C1OC and (C)C.\n\nOC2C1OC: O-C2-C1-O-C. So this connects C2 back to C1, forming a ring. The (C)C is a tert-butyl group (if each C is methyl, but in SMILES, unless specified, C is CH3. Wait, no, in SMILES, C is a carbon atom with unspecified hydrogen. So (C)C would be a C attached to two other Cs. Wait, the SMILES is (C)C, which is a central C connected to two Cs (branches), making it a propyl group? Or a tert-butyl? Hmm, maybe (C)C is C(C)(C)C? No, the SMILES here is (C)C, which would be C-C. But with branches. Wait, no. The SMILES for tert-butyl is C(C)(C)C. But in this case, it's written as (C)C. Let's parse it properly.\n\nThe part OC2OC(...)(C)C:\n\nThe OC2 is O connected to C2. Then OC(...) is O connected to a branch. The branch is OC2C1OC and (C)C. \n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Let's count all atoms in Molecule B:\n\nC1(C(...))OC2OC(OC2C1OC)(C)C\n\nBreaking into components:\n\n1. C1: 1 C\n2. substituents on C1: C(...) and CC(...)\n   - C(NC(C2CCCN2)=O): 1 C (from C(...)), N, C (from C(...)), C2CCCN2 (4 C, 1 N)\n   - CC(OCC)=O: 2 C, OCC (2 C)\n3. OC2OC(...)(C)C: O, C2, O, C(...), (C)C (2 C)\n\nThis is not working. Let me try to count step by step.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES:\n\nC1(C(NC(C2CCCN2)=O)CC(OCC)=O)OC2OC(OC2C1OC)(C)C\n\nCount C:\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nC1 (1) connected to:\n\n- C(NC(...))=O: 1 C (2)\n- NC(...): N attached to C (3) which is part of C2CCCN2 (ring)\n   - C2 (4) connected to C (5), C (6), C (7), N (8), back to C2 (forming a ring)\n   - So the pyrrolidine ring has 4 C (4,5,6,7) and 1 N (8). But wait, C2 is part of the ring. So the ring is C2-C-C-C-N-C2. So that's 5 atoms: 4 C and 1 N. So total C here: 4 (C2, C, C, C) and N=1.\n\nThen CC(OCC)=O:\n\n- CC: 2 C (9,10)\n- OCC: 2 C (11,12)\n- =O: no C.\n\nMain chain after C1: OC2OC(...)(C)C.\n\n- OC2: O and C2 (13)\n- OC(...): O connected to branch OC2C1OC (O, C2 (same as 13?), C1 (1), O, C (14))\n- (C)C: C (15) connected to another C (16)\n\nBut there are ring closures here. The OC2C1OC part connects C2 back to C1, forming a ring. \n\nThis is extremely complicated, but let's try to tally:\n\n- C1:1\n- C in C(NC(...)):2\n- pyrrolidine C2:4 (but C2 is part of the ring, so counted once)\n- CC(OCC)=O: C9, C10\n- OCC: C11, C12\n- OC2: C13\n- OC2C1OC: C13 again (ring closure), C1 (already counted), C14\n- (C)C: C15, C16\n\nBut this is getting messy. Maybe the total C count is similar to Molecule A's 17 C, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if both have the same number of each atom, then they might be the same. But given the time I'm taking, perhaps I should consider that the SMILES strings, despite different ordering and ring numbering, represent the same molecule. But I need to check connectivity.\n\nAnother approach: look for identical groups and connectivity. Both have ethyl ester, pyrrolidine carboxamide, and a cyclic ether with tert-butyl groups. The question is whether the cyclic parts are connected the same way.\n\nIn Molecule A, the cyclic part after the pyrrolidine is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. In Molecule B, it's OC2OC(OC2C1OC)(C)C. If these are different arrangements of the same rings, then they could be the same. For example, if the rings are the same but numbered differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one is a mirror of the other, but since SMILES doesn't account for stereochemistry unless specified, they might be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES are different representations of the same structure due to different ring closures and branch ordering. \n\nGiven the complexity, I think the best approach is to say they are the same molecule, as the functional groups (ethyl ester, pyrrolidine carboxamide, cyclic ethers with tert-butyl) are present in both, and the differences in SMILES are due to different ways of writing the same structure.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine if the two SMILES strings provided represent the same molecule. The user has given me Molecule A and Molecule B, and I have to compare them.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that SMILES strings can sometimes look different but still represent the same molecule due to different starting points or ring numbering. So, the first step is to parse both SMILES into their chemical structures to see if they are identical.\n\nMolecule A: COc1cc2ncnc(N3CCN(C(=O)Nc4ccccn4)CC3)c2cc1OC\nMolecule B: c1(NC(=O)N2CCN(CC2)c2ncnc3c2cc(c(c3)OC)OC)ncccc1\n\nLet me break down each SMILES.\n\nStarting with Molecule A. The SMILES starts with COc1cc2... which indicates a methoxy group (CO-) attached to a benzene ring (c1). Then there's a second ring (c2) connected via some atoms. The part N3CCN(...)CC3 suggests a piperazine ring (since N connected to two CH2 groups and another N). The C(=O) is a carbonyl group, and Nc4ccccn4 is a substituent where an amine (N) is connected to another benzene ring (c4ccccn4, which is a pyridine ring since there's a nitrogen in the ring).\n\nMolecule B's SMILES starts with c1(...)ncccc1. This looks like a benzene ring with substituents. The substituents include NC(=O)N2CCN(CC2), which is similar to the piperazine part in Molecule A. Then there's a c2ncnc3c2... part, which seems like a ring system with two nitrogens. The substituents here include OC (methoxy) groups as well.\n\nI need to check if both SMILES have the same atoms connected in the same way. Let's try to map the structures.\n\nMolecule A has a central benzene ring (c1) with two methoxy groups (OC at positions 1 and another OC at the end, but the numbering might be different). Then there's a fused ring system with a pyrimidine or similar (ncnc). The substituent on the nitrogen is the piperazine ring connected via a carbonyl to an aminopyridine (Nc4ccccn4).\n\nMolecule B starts with a benzene ring (c1) that has a substituent NC(=O)N2CCN(CC2), which is a piperazine connected via a carbonyl to an amine. Then there's another ring system (c2ncnc3...) which might be similar to the fused ring in Molecule A. The methoxy groups (OC) are present here as well.\n\nWait, maybe the core structure is the same, but the way the rings are connected differs. Let me try to draw both structures mentally.\n\nIn Molecule A, the benzene ring (c1) has two methoxy groups. Then, there's a fused ring (c2) which is part of a ncnc (possibly a pyrimidine ring: ncnc would be a five-membered ring with two nitrogens). The substituent on that ring is the piperazine group connected to a carbonyl and then to a pyridine (c4ccccn4 is a pyridine with a substituent on the nitrogen).\n\nIn Molecule B, the core seems to be a benzene ring (c1) with a substituent chain that includes the piperazine, carbonyl, and then another ring system (c2ncnc3...). The methoxy groups are on the c3 part here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES are written in different orders but represent the same connectivity. For example, the benzene ring in Molecule A with methoxy groups might be connected to the pyrimidine ring, which is connected to the piperazine-amide-pyridine part. In Molecule B, maybe the benzene ring is part of the pyridine in the substituent, but that seems different.\n\nWait, let's look again. Molecule A's substituent on the piperazine is C(=O)Nc4ccccn4. That's a carbonyl connected to a NH group, which is connected to a pyridine ring (since c4ccccn4 is a six-membered ring with a nitrogen at position 1 and substituents? Or wait, in pyridine, the nitrogen is at position 1. So c4ccccn4 would be a pyridine ring where the nitrogen is at the end. Wait, the SMILES notation for pyridine is c1ccncc1. But here, it's c4ccccn4. That would be a six-membered ring with the nitrogen at position 5? Because the numbering starts at the first carbon. Let me count: positions 1,2,3,4,5 (n), then 6. So that's a pyridine with substituents. The NH is connected to the pyridine's nitrogen? Wait, no. The N is part of the ring. Wait, the substituent is Nc4ccccn4. So the NH is attached to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the pyridine ring. Let's see: the pyridine ring would be Nc4ccccn4. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's parse that. The ring is c4ccccn4. Starting at c4 (position 1), then c (position 2), c (3), c (4), n (5), and then back to c4 (position 6). Wait, that would make the ring: position 1 (c4), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (n), 6 (c4 again). That can't be right. Maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the SMILES for pyridine is n1cccccc1, but here it's written as c4ccccn4. Let's parse it step by step: the ring closure is 4. So starting at c4, then c, c, c, n, and then back to c4. That would be a six-membered ring: positions 1 (c4), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (n), 6 (c4). But that's only five atoms. Wait, no. The SMILES is c4ccccn4. Let's break it down: c4 is the first atom. Then c, c, c, n, and then the ring closure to 4. So the sequence is c4-c-c-c-n-c4. That's a six-membered ring with one nitrogen. So positions 1 (c4), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (n), 6 (c4). Wait, but that's a ring closure from the fifth atom (n) back to the first (c4). That would form a five-membered ring? Wait, no. Let me count: c4 (1), c (2), c (3), c (4), n (5), then ring closure to 4 (the fourth atom?), but wait, the fourth atom is the third c. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbering. Alternatively, the ring closures are indicated by numbers. So c4...n4 would mean connecting back to the fourth atom. Wait, the SMILES notation for ring closures uses numbers to indicate which atoms are connected. So in c4ccccn4, the first atom is c4 (the 4 is a ring closure label), then c, c, c, n, and then another ring closure 4. Wait, no. The numbers in SMILES for ring closures are just labels; each pair of same numbers indicates a bond between those atoms. So in c4ccccn4, the first atom is a carbon with ring closure label 4, then three carbons, then a nitrogen with ring closure label 4. So the nitrogen is connected back to the first carbon (c4), forming a five-membered ring. Wait, that would be a five-membered ring: positions 1 (c4), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (n), connected back to 1 (c4). That makes a five-membered ring with one nitrogen. But that's not possible because a five-membered ring with one nitrogen would be a pyrrole-like structure, but in this case, the nitrogen is not part of the aromatic ring unless it's in a different valence state. However, SMILES aromaticity rules might assign it as aromatic if possible. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's move on.\n\nThe key point is to compare the two molecules. Another approach is to canonicalize both SMILES strings. If they have the same canonical SMILES, then they are the same molecule. However, I can't do that programmatically here, but I can try to reason about it.\n\nLooking at both SMILES:\n\nMolecule A: COc1cc2ncnc(N3CCN(C(=O)Nc4ccccn4)CC3)c2cc1OC\n\nMolecule B: c1(NC(=O)N2CCN(CC2)c2ncnc3c2cc(c(c3)OC)OC)ncccc1\n\nLet me try to see if the substituents are the same. Both have methoxy groups (OC). Both have a piperazine ring (N3CCN...CC3 in A, and N2CCN(CC2) in B). Both have a carbonyl group (C=O). The substituent on the carbonyl in A is Nc4ccccn4 (a pyridine ring with NH attached?), and in B, the substituent is part of the main chain.\n\nWait, in Molecule B, the structure starts with c1(...)ncccc1, which is a benzene ring (assuming aromatic) with a substituent. The substituent is NC(=O)N2CCN(CC2), which is an amine connected to a carbonyl, then to a piperazine ring (N2CCN(CC2)). Then there's another part: c2ncnc3c2cc(c(c3)OC)OC. This seems like a fused ring system where c2 is a nitrogen-containing ring connected to c3. The c3 part has methoxy groups (OC). Then the main benzene ring (c1) ends with ncccc1, which might indicate a pyridine ring, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main structure in Molecule B is a benzimidazole or similar, but I'm getting confused.\n\nAnother approach: count the number of each type of atom. Let's count the nitrogens. Molecule A: looking at the SMILES, there's N3, N in the piperazine (two Ns), N in the C(=O)N..., and the n in the rings. Let's see:\n\nCOc1cc2ncnc(N3CCN(C(=O)Nc4ccccn4)CC3)c2cc1OC\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- O in COc and OC (methoxy groups)\n- The n in the ring (ncnc)\n- N3 (piperazine has two Ns)\n- N in C(=O)Nc4... (another N)\n- The c4 ring has an n (pyridine-like)\n\nSo nitrogens: in the ncnc part (two n atoms), the N3 piperazine (two Ns), the N in C(=O)N, and the n in c4ccccn4. That's a total of 2 (from ncnc) + 2 (piperazine) + 1 (amide N) + 1 (pyridine N) = 6 nitrogens.\n\nMolecule B: c1(NC(=O)N2CCN(CC2))c2ncnc3c2cc(c(c3)OC)OC)ncccc1\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- NC(=O)N2... (two Ns here)\n- N2CCN(CC2) (piperazine again: two Ns)\n- The c2ncnc3 part has two n atoms\n- The main ring c1 ends with ncccc1, which is a pyridine-like N (one N)\n- Total nitrogens: 2 (NC(=O)) + 2 (piperazine) + 2 (ncnc) +1 (n in c1 ring) = 7? Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's recount:\n\nIn Molecule B's SMILES:\n\n- The first part: NC(=O)N2... has two Ns (the N in NC=O and the N2)\n- The N2 is part of N2CCN(CC2), which is a piperazine (two Ns)\n- The c2ncnc3 part has n, c, n, c: two n atoms in the ring\n- The main ring c1 ends with ncccc1: one N in the ring\n\nTotal nitrogens: 1 (NC=O) + 2 (piperazine) + 2 (ncnc) +1 (main ring) = 6. Wait, but the N2 is part of the piperazine, so that's two Ns. So the count would be 1 (NC=O) + 2 (piperazine) + 2 (ncnc) +1 (main ring N) = 6. So same as Molecule A.\n\nHmm, same number of nitrogens. Let's check oxygens. Molecule A has two methoxy groups (COc and OC), and a carbonyl (O). Molecule B has two OC groups (methoxy) and a carbonyl (O). So same number of oxygens: 2*2 (methoxy) +1 (carbonyl) = 5? Wait, in A, COc is one methoxy (O), and another OC at the end (another O). So two methoxys (2 Os), plus the carbonyl O (C=O), so total 3 O. Molecule B: two OC groups (each O), and the carbonyl O. So three O. Same.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the connectivity is the same. Let's try to see if the substituents are attached in the same positions.\n\nIn Molecule A, the benzene ring (c1) has two methoxy groups. The substituent from the benzene is at position where the ncnc ring is attached. Then, that ncnc ring has a substituent which is the piperazine connected via an amide to a pyridine.\n\nIn Molecule B, the main ring (c1) has a substituent NC(=O)N2... (piperazine), and another substituent which is the c2ncnc3... part. The c3 part has methoxy groups.\n\nWait, perhaps the core structure in A is a benzene ring with two methoxy groups and a fused pyrimidine ring (ncnc), which is connected to the piperazine-amide-pyridine. In B, the main ring is a pyridine (ncccc1), with substituents including the piperazine-amide and another fused ring system with methoxys.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES are written in a way that the main rings are different, but the overall connectivity is the same. However, without visualizing, it's challenging. Another approach is to check if the two SMILES can be standardized into the same form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are enantiomers or different tautomers, but the question is whether they are the same molecule, which would include stereochemistry and tautomerism. However, SMILES usually doesn't specify stereochemistry unless indicated, and tautomerism can vary, but in this case, both seem to have the same groups connected.\n\nWait, another possibility: the order of substituents on the rings might be different but due to SMILES' ability to start numbering from any position, leading to different SMILES strings for the same molecule.\n\nFor example, if the benzene ring in A is numbered starting at a different position than in B, but the substituents are in the same relative positions, then they would be the same molecule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main difference is the placement of the methoxy groups. In A, the benzene ring has two methoxys, while in B, the methoxys are on a different ring. Let me see:\n\nIn Molecule A, the benzene ring is c1, with substituents COc (methoxy) and OC at the end (another methoxy). The rest of the structure is connected via the c2 ring, which is part of the ncnc group.\n\nIn Molecule B, the main ring is c1, which ends with ncccc1 (so a pyridine ring). Then, the substituents include a c2ncnc3 ring, which has methoxys on c3. So the methoxys are on a different ring than in A.\n\nIf that's the case, then the molecules are different because the methoxy groups are attached to different rings. In A, they're on a benzene ring, while in B, they're on a fused ring attached to a pyridine.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be no, they are not the same molecule.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine if the two SMILES strings provided represent the same molecule. The user has given Molecule A and Molecule B, and I have to check if they are identical.\n\nFirst, I'll start by recalling that SMILES strings can sometimes represent the same molecule but written in different ways due to the order of atoms or ring numbering. So my job is to parse both SMILES and see if their structures are the same.\n\nLooking at Molecule A: CC1CN(c2c(F)c(N)c3c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C4CC4)c3c2F)C(C)CN1\n\nAnd Molecule B: CC1NCC(N(c2c(F)c(N)c3c(=O)c(cn(C4CC4)c3c2F)C(O)=O)C1)C\n\nHmm, let's break them down. Both have a cyclohexane ring (C4CC4) as part of their structure, which is a four-membered ring. Let's look for the main framework.\n\nStarting with Molecule A. The core structure seems to be a cyclic amine. The SMILES starts with CC1CN(...)C(C)CN1. The part in the middle is a substituent attached to the nitrogen. Let's parse that substituent: c2c(F)c(N)c3c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C4CC4)c3c2F. This looks like a bicyclic system. The c2...c3... suggests a fused ring. The substituents here include fluorine atoms (F), an amino group (N), a ketone (=O), a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O), and the cyclohexane (C4CC4) attached via a nitrogen (n).\n\nNow, Molecule B's SMILES is CC1NCC(N(...)C1)C. The core here is a ring as well (CC1NCC...C1), which might be a five-membered ring. The substituent on the nitrogen is similar to A's: c2c(F)c(N)c3c(=O)c(cn(C4CC4)c3c2F)C(O)=O. Wait, here the carboxylic acid group is written as C(O)=O instead of C(=O)O. But those are equivalent; the order of the double bond doesn't matter in SMILES. So that's the same group. The rest of the substituent seems similar: fluorine, amino, ketone, cyclohexane attached via a nitrogen.\n\nBut the main difference might be in the core structure. Molecule A's core is CC1CN(...)C(C)CN1. Let's count the atoms in the ring. The ring closure is at the end with N1. The ring starts with CC1, then C, N, then the substituent, then C(C)C, N, and back to 1. Wait, that would make the ring: positions 1 (C), then another C, N, then after the substituent, there's C(C)CN1. So the ring is 1 (C), then C, N, ... then C(C)C, N, and back to 1. So the ring has atoms: C1, C, N, ..., C, N. Wait, maybe I need to count the atoms in the ring. Let's parse the ring for Molecule A:\n\nThe ring starts at CC1CN(...)C(C)CN1. Breaking it down:\n\n- CC1: the first carbon is connected to another C (the first CC) and is part of ring 1.\n- Then comes C: connected to the first C in ring 1.\n- Then N: connected to that C.\n- The substituent (c2c(F)...) is attached to the N.\n- Then C(C)CN1: after the substituent, there's a C connected to two C's (C(C)), then another C, then N connected back to ring 1.\n\nSo the ring structure is C1-C-N-...-C(C)-C-N1. That would make a 6-membered ring: C1 (position 1), then C (position 2), N (3), then perhaps positions 4,5,6? Wait, maybe the ring is formed by 1 (C1) -> C (position 2) -> N (3) -> ... then after some substituents, there's C(C) (position 4?), then C (position 5), N (position 6), connecting back to position 1. So a 6-membered ring with atoms C, C, N, C, C, N?\n\nWait, maybe I should draw this mentally. Let's try to map the ring:\n\nMolecule A's ring is built as follows:\n\nStart at C1 (part of CC1...). The next atoms are C (from CC1CN...), then N. Then the substituent is on the N. Then after the substituent, we have C(C)CN1. So after the N (position 3 in the ring), the ring continues with C(C) (position 4), then C (position 5), then N (position 6), which connects back to C1 (position 1). So the ring is 6-membered: positions 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (N), 4 (C(C)), 5 (C), 6 (N).\n\nMolecule B's SMILES is CC1NCC(N(...)C1)C. Let's parse its ring:\n\nCC1NCC(...)C1. The ring starts with C1 connected to C and N. Then the next atoms are N (position 1 is C?), wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's break down:\n\nThe SMILES is CC1NCC(N(...)C1)C. The ring is formed by the closure at 1. Let's see:\n\n- CC1: the first C is connected to another C (the first CC), and part of ring 1.\n- Then N: attached to C1.\n- Then C: connected to N.\n- Then C: connected to the previous C (so NCC...)\n- Then the substituent N(...) is attached to the second C in NCC.\n- Then C1 closes the ring.\n\nWait, the ring is CC1NCC(...)C1. So the ring starts at C1 (position 1), then N (position 2), then C (position 3), C (position 4), and back to C1 via the closure. Wait, but that would make a 4-membered ring: positions 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C), 4 (C), and back to 1. But that would be a 4-membered ring? But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm misparsing. Let me try again.\n\nThe SMILES for Molecule B is:\n\nCC1NCC(N(...)C1)C\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- The first part is CC1: a carbon connected to another carbon (the first C in CC1) and part of ring 1 (the 1 here).\n- Then N: attached to C1.\n- Then C: attached to N.\n- Then another C: forming a chain of N-C-C.\n- Then the next part is N(...) which is attached to the second C in the chain.\n- Then C1 closes the ring. So the ring is formed by C1 -> N -> C -> C -> ... and then back to C1. Wait, but how many atoms are in the ring?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ring is C1 (C), N, C, C, and then back to C1. That would be a 4-membered ring: C1 (C), N, C, C. But that would require the closure to be at the end. Let me check: the SMILES is CC1NCC(N(...)C1)C. The C1 is at the beginning and then after the NCC part, there's a C1 closure. So the ring would be C1 connected to N, then C, C, and then back to C1. So positions: 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C), 4 (C), connected back to 1. That's a 4-membered ring. But that seems strained. However, SMILES allows such representations.\n\nSo the core structure in Molecule B is a 4-membered ring: C-C-N-C-C (but wait, that's five atoms? No, wait, C1 is the first carbon, then N is attached to it, then two Cs, then closure back to C1. So the ring is C1 (C), N, C, C, and then back to C1? Wait, that would be a 4-membered ring: C1 (C) -> N (position 2) -> C (position 3) -> C (position 4) -> back to C1. So the ring has four members: C, N, C, C. That seems possible but maybe less common. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in parsing.\n\nWait, the SMILES for Molecule B is CC1NCC(N(...)C1)C. Let's write the connections:\n\n- The first C is connected to another C (from CC1) and part of ring 1 (C1).\n- Then comes N connected to C1.\n- Then C connected to N (position 2).\n- Then another C connected to the previous C (position 3).\n- Then we have a substituent N(...) attached to position 4 (the second C in the NCC chain).\n- Then the C1 closure connects back to C1, making the ring close here. So the ring would be C1 (C) -> N (position 2) -> C (position3) -> C (position4) -> back to C1. So a 4-membered ring: C, N, C, C.\n\nBut in Molecule A, the ring is 6-membered. So the core rings are different: 6-membered in A and 4-membered in B. If that's the case, then the molecules are different. But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rings are the same. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Molecule A's core ring: CC1CN(...)C(C)CN1. So the ring starts at C1, then C, then N, then after the substituent, there's C(C)C, then N connected back to C1. So the ring would be C1-C-N-...-C(C)-C-N1. Let's count the atoms:\n\n1. C1 (from CC1)\n2. C (next in chain)\n3. N (connected to that C)\n4. Then after the substituent, there's C(C) (which is part of the ring)\n5. Then C (connected to C(C))\n6. Then N (connected to that C, and back to C1)\n\nSo that's a 6-membered ring: C1-C-N-C(C)-C-N.\n\nIn Molecule B, the core ring is CC1NCC(...)C1. The ring is:\n\n1. C1 (from CC1)\n2. N (attached to C1)\n3. C (next in chain)\n4. C (next)\n5. Then closure back to C1 via C1 at the end.\n\nWait, that's four members: C1, N, C, C. So a 4-membered ring. That's different from A's 6-membered ring. If that's the case, then the molecules are different.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to write the rings explicitly.\n\nFor Molecule A:\n\nThe SMILES is CC1CN( [substituent] )C(C)CN1.\n\nBreaking down the ring:\n\n- The ring starts with CC1: the first C is connected to another C (the first CC) and is part of ring 1 (C1).\n- The next atom is C (from CC1C...).\n- Then N (from CC1CN...).\n- Then comes the substituent attached to N.\n- After the substituent, we have C(C) (from ...C(C)CN1).\n- Then another C (from ...C(C)C...).\n- Then N (from ...CN1), which connects back to C1 (ring closure).\n\nSo the ring atoms in order are:\n\n1. C1 (position 1)\n2. C (position 2)\n3. N (position 3)\n4. C(C) (position 4)\n5. C (position 5)\n6. N (position 6), connected back to C1.\n\nSo it's a 6-membered ring: C-C-N-C(C)-C-N.\n\nIn Molecule B, the SMILES is CC1NCC( [substituent] )C1)C.\n\nBreaking down the ring:\n\n- CC1: first C connected to another C (the CC), part of ring 1.\n- Next is N (attached to C1).\n- Then C (from N-C...).\n- Then another C (from C-C...).\n- The substituent is attached to this second C.\n- Then closure with C1 (from ...C1).\n\nSo the ring atoms are:\n\n1. C1 (position 1)\n2. N (position 2)\n3. C (position 3)\n4. C (position 4)\n5. Then back to C1 via the closure.\n\nWait, but that's a 4-membered ring: C1-N-C-C-C1? Wait, no. The closure is from the last C (position 4) back to C1. So the ring is C1 (1) -> N (2) -> C (3) -> C (4) -> C1 (1). So four members: C, N, C, C. That's a four-membered ring.\n\nIf the core rings are different (6-membered vs. 4-membered), then the molecules are definitely different. But maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents are different. Let's compare the substituents attached to the nitrogen in both molecules.\n\nMolecule A's substituent: c2c(F)c(N)c3c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C4CC4)c3c2F\n\nBreaking this down: it's a bicyclic system. Let's parse it:\n\n- Starting with c2 (a carbon in a ring), then connected to F (c2c(F)...)\n- Next carbon (c) has an NH group (c(N))\n- Then c3 (another ring), connected via c3c(=O) etc.\n- The structure seems to have a fused ring between the c2 and c3 rings, creating a bicyclic system. The ketone (=O), carboxylic acid (C(=O)O), and the cyclohexane (C4CC4) attached to a nitrogen (n(...)).\n\nMolecule B's substituent: c2c(F)c(N)c3c(=O)c(cn(C4CC4)c3c2F)C(O)=O\n\nHere, the substituent starts similarly: c2c(F)c(N)... then c3, with ketone (=O), followed by a carbon connected to a cyano group (cn(C4CC4)) and a carboxylic acid (C(O)=O). Wait, in Molecule A, the carboxylic acid is C(=O)O, which is equivalent to C(O)=O. So that's the same group. The cyclohexane (C4CC4) is attached to the nitrogen in both cases. So the substituents here might be identical.\n\nIf the substituents are the same but the core rings are different (6-membered vs. 4-membered), then the molecules are different. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps I should generate the canonical SMILES for both and compare. However, since I can't actually run a parser here, I have to rely on structural analysis.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number of rings or other features. Molecule A has a 6-membered ring in the core, and the substituent has a fused ring (c2 and c3). Molecule B has a 4-membered core ring and the same substituent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the core rings are actually the same but written differently. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in SMILES, the order of writing atoms in a ring can affect the numbering but not the structure. For example, a six-membered ring can be written starting at any atom. However, the connectivity must be the same.\n\nIn Molecule A's core: the ring is C1-C-N-C(C)-C-N-C1 (6 members). In Molecule B's core: C1-N-C-C-C1 (4 members). These are different ring sizes, so the molecules cannot be the same.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the two molecules are different. The answer is No.",

Let me break them down.\n\nStarting with Molecule A. The main chain seems to be a central carbon connected to a carbonyl group (C(=O)), which is attached to an NCc group. The NCc is connected to a benzene ring (c1ccc...nc1). The benzene ring has a CF3 group (C(F)(F)F) and an oxygen-connected ethyl group (OCc1ccc(F)cc1). Then, the central carbon also has a branch with a benzene ring (c1ccc(NS(C)(=O)=O)c(F)c1).\n\nMolecule B's SMILES starts with a benzene ring (c1c(...)ccc1C(C)...). The benzene has an NS(=O)(=O)C group attached. The central part is C(C)C(...)=O, which is a carbonyl connected to a NCc group similar to Molecule A. The NCc connects to the same CF3 and OCc groups as in A. \n\nWait, maybe the central structure is similar. Let me check the substituents. Both have the CF3 on a benzene ring attached via an oxygen to another benzene with fluorine. The sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)C) is present in both, but in A it's on a benzene ring as NS(C)(=O)=O, which is the same as S(=O)(=O) attached to N and a methyl group. In B, it's written as NS(=O)(=O)C, which is the same thing. \n\nLooking at the main chain: In A, the central part is CC(C(=O)NCc...), which is a carbon connected to two methyl groups (the first CC), then a carbonyl attached to NCc. In B, the central part is C(C)C(...)=O. Wait, C(C)C would be a propyl group with two methyl branches? Let me visualize. The SMILES for B's central part is C(C)C(...)=O. So that's a carbonyl group attached to a C(C)C, which is a tertiary carbon (like (CH3)2CH-). But in A, the central part is CC(C(=O)...), which is a carbon connected to a methyl group and another carbon that has the carbonyl. Wait, maybe the branching is different. \n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the SMILES more carefully. For Molecule A: The main chain starts with CC, so two carbons. Then the second C has a branch: C(=O)NCc... So that's a carbonyl group attached to a NCc (which is a methylene group connected to an amine). Then, the rest of the structure. \n\nFor Molecule B: The main chain is c1c(...)ccc1C(C)C(...)=O. The benzene ring is connected to a C(C)C group, which is a tertiary carbon (two methyl groups attached to a central carbon), which is then connected to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl is part of the structure C(C)C(NC...)=O. \n\nSo in Molecule A, the carbonyl is directly attached to the NCc group and part of a branch from a central carbon. In Molecule B, the carbonyl is part of a tertiary carbon (C(C)C=O), which is connected to the NCc group. \n\nThis difference in the connectivity might indicate that they are different structures. Let me check if it's just a different way of writing the same structure. For example, maybe the position of the substituents on the benzene rings is different. \n\nLooking at the benzene rings: In Molecule A, the central part is CC(...)c1ccc(NS...)c(F)c1. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions that are adjacent (since the SMILES starts with c1ccc(...), which would be positions 1, 2, 4 maybe? Wait, SMILES notation is based on the order of the atoms. Let me consider the numbering. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main difference is that in Molecule A, the sulfonamide group (NS(C)(=O)=O) is on a benzene ring that's attached to the central carbon, whereas in Molecule B, the sulfonamide is on the same benzene ring as the fluorine. Wait, let me try to draw this mentally. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES strings are just different representations of the same molecule. For example, the order in which substituents are listed can vary, but the actual structure is the same. \n\nAnother approach: canonicalize both SMILES. If the canonical SMILES are the same, then they are the same molecule. Since I can't actually compute that here, I have to compare manually. \n\nLooking at both structures, the substituents might be the same but arranged differently. For example, the central carbonyl group in A is attached to a methyl group (from CC) and another carbon that has the NCc group. In B, the carbonyl is part of a C(C)C group, which is a tertiary carbon (two methyl groups and the carbonyl). Wait, that would make the carbonyl in B attached to a tertiary carbon, whereas in A, the carbonyl is attached to a secondary carbon (connected to two carbons: the methyl and the NCc branch). \n\nSo if the carbonyl is attached to different types of carbons (secondary vs. tertiary), then the molecules are different. Therefore, the answer would be No. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Let me check again. \n\nMolecule A: CC(C(=O)NCc...)c1ccc(...) \n\nSo the first part is CC(...), which is a carbon connected to two methyl groups (the first C is part of CC), then the next C is connected to the carbonyl. So the structure is:\n\n- Central carbon (let's call it C1) connected to two methyl groups (C(C)(C)...)\nWait, no. The SMILES is CC(C(=O)...) which is a central carbon (C) connected to another C (the first C), then that second C has a branch: C(=O). So the structure is:\n\n- A central methyl group (C) connected to another carbon (C) which has a carbonyl group (C(=O)). So the central part is like CH2-C(=O)-... \n\nWait, no. Wait, the SMILES is written as CC(C(=O)...). So, the first C is connected to another C (the second C), which has a branch: the C(=O). So the structure is:\n\nThe first C is a methyl group (connected to the second C). The second C has three bonds: one to the first C (methyl), one to the carbonyl group (C(=O)), and one to the NCc group. So that's a carbon with three substituents: methyl, carbonyl, and NCc. So that's a tertiary carbon (assuming the fourth bond is to another carbon). Wait, but SMILES uses valence. Carbon must have four bonds. \n\nSo the second C (in CC(C(=O)...)) is connected to: the first C (methyl), the C(=O), the NCc..., and what else? The main chain continues. Wait, maybe after the NCc..., there's another part. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire structure is a central carbon with branches. But this is getting complicated. \n\nIn Molecule B, the structure is c1c(...)ccc1C(C)C(...)=O. The benzene ring (c1c(...)ccc1) is connected to a C(C)C group. The C(C)C is connected to a carbonyl (=O) and another group (NCc...). So the structure here is a tertiary carbon (C(C)C) connected to the carbonyl. \n\nSo in Molecule A, the carbonyl is attached to a secondary carbon (since the carbon attached to the carbonyl is connected to two carbons: the methyl and the NCc group), while in Molecule B, the carbonyl is attached to a tertiary carbon (connected to two methyl groups and the carbonyl). \n\nIf that's the case, then the molecules are structural isomers and therefore different.

Then there's another benzene ring at the end (c1ccccc1). \n\nNow, Molecule B's SMILES is c1(C(O)CN2C3CCC2CC(C3)c2ccccc2)ccccc1. Starting with the benzene ring (c1...ccccc1), the substituent on the benzene is C(O)CN2C3CCC2CC(C3)c2ccccc2. The C(O) part is a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon, which connects to another carbon with an amine (N2). Then there's another ring structure: N2C3CCC2CC(C3)... This seems similar to the ring in Molecule A but perhaps arranged differently. The C3 is part of a cyclopropane-like ring, and there's a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) attached here.\n\nI need to check if the connectivity and arrangement of the atoms are the same. Let's compare the rings. In Molecule A, the nitrogen (N1) is connected to C2, forming a ring. The sequence is N1C2CCC1CC..., which suggests a 7-membered ring? Wait, let me count: N1 connected to C2, then three Cs (C2-C-C-C), back to C1 (since CCC1 would close the ring here). Then CC(c1ccccc1)C2. Hmm, maybe a bicyclic structure. Similarly, in Molecule B, the rings are N2C3CCC2CC(C3)... So the nitrogen is part of a ring with C3, then three Cs, closing back to C2. Then CC(C3), which might create a bridge.\n\nAlso, the positions of the substituents might differ. In Molecule A, the hydroxyl group (O) is attached to a carbon that's connected to the amine and the benzene. In Molecule B, the hydroxyl is part of the substituent on the benzene ring. Wait, the SMILES for B starts with the benzene ring (c1...) with a substituent at position 1 (since it's written as c1(...)ccccc1). The substituent is C(O)CN2..., which would be a carbon attached to O (as -OH), then a CH2 group connected to N2. \n\nComparing the core structures: both have a bicyclic amine system (like a tropane or similar) attached to a benzene ring. But the placement of the hydroxyl group and the benzene rings might vary. Let me try to draw both structures mentally.\n\nIn Molecule A, the hydroxyl is on a central carbon connected to the amine ring and a benzene. The amine ring has two bridges: one from N1 to C2, then another bridge connecting to the benzene. In Molecule B, the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's part of the substituent attached to the benzene ring. The amine ring in B is connected via N2 and the substituent chain.\n\nAnother approach is to canonicalize both SMILES strings. If they are the same when converted to canonical form, they're the same molecule. Alternatively, differences in the SMILES notation (like different starting points or ring numbering) could lead to different strings even if the molecules are the same.\n\nLet me check if the two SMILES represent the same structure. For example, in Molecule A, the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's part of a chain leading to the amine ring. In Molecule B, the hydroxyl is on a carbon attached to the benzene ring. Wait, no. Let's parse again.\n\nMolecule A: OC(...) The O is attached to a central carbon (C), which is connected to CN1... and the benzene (c1ccccc1). So the structure is O-C(...) where the C is connected to another C (from CN1), the amine ring, and a benzene.\n\nMolecule B: The benzene ring (c1...) has a substituent at position 1 which is C(O)CN2... So that substituent is a carbon attached to O (as -OH), then CH2 connected to N2. The rest of the amine ring structure (N2C3CCC2CC(C3)c2ccccc2) is similar to Molecule A's amine ring but perhaps arranged differently.\n\nWait, maybe the difference is in how the substituents are attached. The hydroxyl group in A is on a central carbon that's connected to both the amine ring and a benzene. In B, the hydroxyl is part of a substituent on a benzene ring, which is connected via a chain to the amine ring. So the overall connectivity might be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES are just written in a different order but represent the same structure. For example, the benzene rings could be in different positions but actually the same due to symmetry. But given the complexity of the substituents, it's less likely.\n\nAnother way to check is to look for the number of rings and their types. Both molecules have benzene rings and a bicyclic amine system. The key difference might be where the hydroxyl group is attached. If the hydroxyl is on a different part of the molecule, they are not the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES strings are different representations of the same molecule. For example, different starting points in the SMILES can lead to different strings. Let me try to canonicalize them.\n\nUsing a SMILES parser, if available, would help. Since I can't do that here, I have to rely on manual analysis. \n\nLooking at the substituents:\n\nIn Molecule A: The central structure is O-C-CH2-N(ring). The benzene is attached to this central carbon. The amine ring has a bridge with another benzene.\n\nIn Molecule B: The benzene has a substituent that's a chain: C(OH)-CH2-N(ring). The amine ring in B has a bridge with another benzene.\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is that in Molecule A, the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's part of a chain leading to the amine, and the benzene is attached to that same carbon. In Molecule B, the hydroxyl is on a carbon that's attached to the benzene ring, and the chain leads to the amine. So their structures are different. For example, the hydroxyl's position relative to the benzene and amine rings differs, making them constitutional isomers, hence different molecules.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.",

First, I need to parse each SMILES to understand their structures.\n\nStarting with Molecule A: O=C(Oc1ccccc1C(=O)Oc1ccccc1)c1cccnc1. Breaking it down, the central part is the carbonyl group (O=C) attached to an oxygen (O) which is connected to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1). That benzene ring has a substituent: another carbonyl group (C(=O)O) attached to another benzene ring (c1ccccc1). Then the main carbonyl is also connected to a pyridine ring (c1cccnc1). Wait, the pyridine has a nitrogen in the ring. So the structure would be a central carbonyl linked to a benzene ring with an ester group (O-C=O) connected to another benzene, and the other side attached to a pyridine.\n\nNow Molecule B: n1cc(C(=O)Oc2ccccc2C(=O)Oc2ccccc2)ccc1. Here, the main ring is a pyridine (n1cc...ccc1). The substituent on the pyridine is a group attached to the second carbon (since it's n1cc(...)ccc1). The substituent is C(=O)Oc2ccccc2C(=O)Oc2ccccc2. That looks similar to the substituent in Molecule A. The substituent here is a carbonyl (C=O) connected to an oxygen, which is attached to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2), which then has another carbonyl group (C(=O)O) connected to another benzene ring (c2ccccc2). So the substituent is the same as in Molecule A: a bis-ester linking two benzene rings.\n\nSo comparing both molecules: Molecule A has a central carbonyl attached to an oxygen-benzene-ester-benzene group and a pyridine ring. Molecule B has a pyridine ring where one of the carbons is substituted with the same ester-benzene-ester-benzene group. Wait, in Molecule A, the central carbonyl is connected to the oxygen and the pyridine. In Molecule B, the substituent is on the pyridine. Let me visualize this.\n\nWait, maybe the central part in A is O=C(O-...)c1cccnc1. The carbonyl (C=O) is attached to an oxygen that's connected to the benzene rings, and also attached to the pyridine ring's carbon. So the pyridine is directly connected to the central carbonyl. In Molecule B, the substituent on the pyridine is the ester group. So the structure would be pyridine with a substituent that's the same ester group as in A. Are these two structures actually the same, just written in a different order?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES strings are different representations of the same molecule. Let me check the connectivity. For Molecule A: The central carbonyl (O=C) is attached to two groups: the oxygen (O) which links to the benzene rings, and the pyridine ring (c1cccnc1). So the structure is a pyridine ring connected via a carbonyl group to an ester-linked bis-benzene group.\n\nFor Molecule B: The pyridine ring (n1cc...ccc1) has a substituent on the second carbon (since it's n1cc(...)ccc1, the substituent is on the second carbon of the pyridine). The substituent is C(=O)O... which is the same ester-benzene-ester-benzene group. So in this case, the substituent is attached to the pyridine's carbon via a carbonyl group. Wait, but in Molecule A, the pyridine is attached to the carbonyl, which is part of the central atom. In Molecule B, the substituent on the pyridine is a carbonyl connected to the ester groups.\n\nWait, perhaps they are actually the same. Because in SMILES notation, the order can vary depending on how you traverse the molecule. Let me try to write both SMILES in a standard way.\n\nMolecule A: The central atom is the C of the carbonyl (O=C). One branch is O connected to a benzene ring (Oc1ccccc1C(=O)Oc2ccccc2), and the other branch is the pyridine ring (c1cccnc1). So the structure is O=C(O-benzene-ester-benzene)-pyridine.\n\nMolecule B: The pyridine ring (n1cc(C(=O)O...)ccc1) has a substituent at position 2 (since the pyridine is n1, the positions are 1 (N), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The substituent is at position 2. The substituent is C(=O)O-benzene-ester-benzene. So the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the pyridine's C2, then the rest as before.\n\nWait, but in Molecule A, the carbonyl is attached to the pyridine's carbon. Let me check the SMILES again. Molecule A's SMILES is O=C(...)c1cccnc1. The 'c' here is part of the pyridine ring. So the carbonyl is connected to the pyridine's carbon. In SMILES, the order matters in terms of how the atoms are connected. So the central carbonyl has two substituents: the O-linked part and the pyridine ring.\n\nIn Molecule B, the substituent is a C(=O)O... group attached to the pyridine's carbon. So the structure is pyridine with a substituent that's a carbonyl connected to the ester-benzene-ester-benzene. But in Molecule A, the carbonyl is between the pyridine and the ester-benzene part. Wait, that sounds the same. Because if you have a carbonyl connected to the pyridine's carbon and the ester group, then both structures would be the same. Let me draw it out mentally.\n\nIn Molecule A: The carbonyl is O=C(O-...)c1cccnc1. So the carbonyl's carbon is connected to O-... and to the pyridine's carbon. The pyridine is a ring with a nitrogen. Let's say the carbonyl is attached to the pyridine's carbon at position 4 (assuming the numbering starts where the nitrogen is 1). Then in Molecule B, the substituent is on position 2 of the pyridine, which is a carbonyl group. But wait, maybe the numbering is different due to SMILES notation.\n\nAlternatively, SMILES strings can represent the same molecule even if written in different orders, depending on how the rings are closed and the branches are ordered. The key is to see if the connectivity is the same.\n\nAnother approach is to convert both SMILES to their canonical form using a tool like RDKit. However, since I can't do that here, I need to analyze the SMILES manually.\n\nLooking at Molecule A: The central carbonyl (C=O) is connected to an oxygen that's part of an ester group (Oc1ccccc1C(=O)Oc2ccccc2). The other side of the carbonyl is connected to a pyridine ring (c1cccnc1). So the structure is:\n\nPyridine ring (c1cccnc1) connected via a carbonyl group (C=O) to an oxygen, which is part of a benzene ring (Oc1ccccc1) that has another ester group (C(=O)Oc2ccccc2).\n\nMolecule B: The pyridine ring (n1cc(C(=O)O...)ccc1) has a substituent at position 2, which is a carbonyl group (C(=O)) connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a benzene ring (Oc2ccccc2), which in turn is connected to another ester group (C(=O)Oc2ccccc2). Wait, the SMILES for B has two 'c2' rings? Let me parse that again. The substituent is C(=O)Oc2ccccc2C(=O)Oc2ccccc2. The first 'c2' is a benzene ring, then another C(=O)O group, and then another 'c2' ring. But since the second 'c2' is defined again, it's actually a separate benzene ring. So the substituent in B is a carbonyl group connected to an oxygen, which is connected to a benzene ring, which has a carbonyl oxygen connected to another benzene ring. So the substituent is O-C(=O)-benzene-C(=O)-O-benzene.\n\nWait, but in Molecule A, the substituent is O-C(=O)-benzene-O-C(=O)-benzene. Wait, no. Let me check again. Molecule A's substituent is Oc1ccccc1C(=O)Oc1ccccc1. So the first O is connected to the benzene (c1ccccc1), which has a C(=O)O group attached, which is connected to another benzene (c1ccccc1 again? Wait, but the same ring closing numbers are reused. In SMILES, once a ring number is closed (like 1), it can't be reused. So the SMILES for Molecule A: O=C(Oc1ccccc1C(=O)Oc2ccccc2)c3cccnc3. Wait, maybe there was a typo in the original input. Let me re-examine the input.\n\nOriginal input: Molecule A: O=C(Oc1ccccc1C(=O)Oc1ccccc1)c1cccnc1. Here, the first benzene is c1, then within that benzene, there's a C(=O)Oc1ccccc1. Wait, the ring closure numbers are reused here, which is not allowed in SMILES. Because after opening ring 1 with c1, it's closed with the last c1. Then, the next Oc1ccccc1 would open a new ring 1, but in SMILES, each ring closure number must be unique. So this might be a mistake in the input SMILES. Similarly for Molecule B: n1cc(C(=O)Oc2ccccc2C(=O)Oc2ccccc2)ccc1. Here, the substituent has Oc2... then another Oc2..., which reuses ring number 2. That's invalid SMILES syntax. So perhaps there's a typo in the input. If that's the case, maybe the intended structure is different.\n\nAssuming that the user made a typo and the correct SMILES for Molecule A is O=C(Oc1ccccc1C(=O)Oc2ccccc2)c3cccnc3. Similarly, Molecule B would be n1cc(C(=O)Oc2ccccc2C(=O)Oc3ccccc3)ccc1. If that's the case, then the substituent in both molecules would be the same: a group with two benzene rings connected via ester groups.\n\nBut given the original input as written, both SMILES have reused ring closure numbers, which is invalid. However, perhaps the user intended them as separate rings. If we ignore that and parse as intended, then both substituents are O-C6H4-C(=O)-O-C6H4.\n\nSo comparing the two molecules:\n\nMolecule A: Central carbonyl connected to O-(benzene-ester-benzene) and to a pyridine ring.\n\nMolecule B: Pyridine ring with a substituent at position 2, which is a carbonyl connected to O-(benzene-ester-benzene).\n\nBut wait, in Molecule A, the carbonyl is between the pyridine and the ester group. In Molecule B, the substituent on the pyridine is a carbonyl connected to the ester group. So structurally, they are the same. Because the carbonyl is part of the substituent on the pyridine. So in both cases, the pyridine is connected via a carbonyl group to the ester-benzene-ester-benzene group. The difference in SMILES notation is just the starting point. For example, in A, the SMILES starts with the carbonyl, then branches to the ester and the pyridine. In B, the SMILES starts with the pyridine, which has a substituent that includes the carbonyl and ester groups.\n\nIf that's the case, then the two SMILES represent the same molecule, just written in different orders. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.",

Both are given, and I have to compare them.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that SMILES notation can sometimes represent the same molecule in different ways due to the order of branches or parentheses. The key is to parse them correctly and check if they are isomorphic, meaning the atoms are connected in the same way.\n\nMolecule A's SMILES is O=S(=O)(NCCCCCO)c1ccc(-c2ccc(O)cc2)cc1. Let me break that down. The central sulfur atom (S) is double-bonded to two oxygen atoms (=O) and also connected to a nitrogen group (NCCCCCO) and a benzene ring (c1ccc...). The benzene ring has a substituent which is another benzene ring (-c2ccc(O)cc2) with an oxygen (O) in the para position.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES is O=S(NCCCCCO)(c1ccc(-c2ccc(cc2)O)cc1)=O. Here, the sulfur is bonded to the same groups: an oxygen with a double bond (=O), the nitrogen group (NCCCCCO), and the benzene ring. The benzene ring substituent is again another benzene ring (-c2ccc(cc2)O), but the oxygen here is in a different position? Wait, let me check the numbering.\n\nIn SMILES, the order of substituents matters in how they're placed on the ring. For the substituent in Molecule A's benzene ring (-c2ccc(O)cc2), the oxygen is on the fourth carbon of the second benzene ring (since the ring is c2, then the positions are 1-6). The pattern ccc(O)cc2 would place the O at position 4. In Molecule B's substituent (-c2ccc(cc2)O), the oxygen is attached to position 5? Wait, let me parse that. The second benzene ring is c2, then the sequence is ccc(cc2)O. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's write out the ring structure for each substituent.\n\nFor Molecule A's substituent: c2ccc(O)cc2. Starting at the first carbon, then three carbons (positions 1, 2, 3), then position 4 is O, then positions 5 and 6 are carbons. So the oxygen is at position 4 of the benzene ring.\n\nFor Molecule B's substituent: c2ccc(cc2)O. Let's parse this. The benzene ring is c2, then positions 1, 2, 3. At position 4, there's a branch (cc2)O. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let's break it down step by step. The substituent in B is -c2ccc(cc2)O. So starting the second benzene ring (c2), then three carbons (positions 1, 2, 3). At position 4, there's a branch: (cc2), which would connect back to position 1 (since c2 is the ring closure). Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is c2 connected as follows: c2 (position 1), then c (position 2), c (position 3), c (position 4) with a branch (cc2), which would be positions 5 and 6? Then the O is outside that, so maybe the oxygen is attached to position 4. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should draw the structures mentally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES notation for the substituent in B is written as c2ccc(cc2)O. Let's parse that. The ring closure is c2, so starting at position 1 (c2), then next three c's (positions 2, 3, 4). Position 4 has a branch (cc2), which would be two more carbons connected here, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzene ring where the oxygen is attached to position 4, similar to Molecule A. Wait, perhaps the SMILES strings are just written with different ordering of substituents but the same structure.\n\nAnother approach: SMILES can have different representations based on the order of writing substituents. The central sulfur in both molecules has four substituents: two oxygens (one double-bonded, another double-bonded?), wait no. Wait, sulfur in the sulfonyl group is S(=O)(=O). Wait, in Molecule A: O=S(=O)(NCCCCCO)c1... So the sulfur has two double-bonded oxygens (O=S(=O)), then two single bonds: one to the NCCCCCO group and one to the benzene ring. Similarly for Molecule B: O=S(NCCCCCO)(c1...) The order of substituents around the sulfur doesn't matter because they are all single bonds except the two double bonds. So the arrangement of substituents (NCCCCCO and the benzene ring) as branches in the SMILES string doesn't affect the actual structure because they are all single-bonded, so the order in the SMILES doesn't change the molecule.\n\nAs for the benzene rings, the substituent in A is -c2ccc(O)cc2. That's a benzene ring with an oxygen in the para position. For B, the substituent is -c2ccc(cc2)O. Let's parse that. The ring starts at c2, then three c's (positions 1, 2, 3, 4?), but the SMILES is c2ccc(cc2)O. Wait, maybe it's c2 (position 1), then c (position 2), c (position 3), c (position 4). Then at position 4, there's a branch (cc2), which would be positions 5 and 6 connected back to position 1 (since c2 is the ring closure). But then the O is outside. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzene ring with an oxygen attached to position 4, same as in A. Because the SMILES c2ccc(cc2)O can be read as follows: start with c2 (position 1), then three c's (positions 2, 3, 4). At position 4, there's a branch (cc2), which would be positions 5 and 6 (but that's the same as the ring closure, so perhaps it's a benzene ring where the oxygen is attached to position 5? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for the substituent in B is written as c2ccc(cc2)O. Let's number the benzene ring as positions 1-6. Starting at position 1 (c2), then positions 2, 3, 4. At position 4, there's a branch: cc2. So position 4 is connected to two more carbons (positions 5 and 6), but then the ring closure is to position 1 (c2). Wait, that doesn't form a benzene ring. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent in B is a benzene ring where the oxygen is attached to position 5. Let me try to write the SMILES again. The substituent is -c2ccc(cc2)O. Breaking it down:\n\n- Start with c2 (ring closure 2)\n- Then c (position 1)\n- c (position 2)\n- c (position 3)\n- ( then c (position 4) and c2 (ring closure back to position 1)\n- ) followed by O attached where? At position 4?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzene ring where the oxygen is at position 4, similar to A. Maybe the different SMILES strings are just different representations of the same structure. For example, in A, the substituent is written as -c2ccc(O)cc2, which is benzene ring with O at position 4. In B, it's written as -c2ccc(cc2)O. Wait, perhaps that's the same. Let me visualize:\n\nIn SMILES notation, when you have a ring closure, the order matters. For the substituent in A: c2ccc(O)cc2. The O is in the fourth position. For B's substituent: c2ccc(cc2)O. Let's parse this as:\n\nc2 (position 1), then c (2), c (3), c (4). At position 4, there's a branch (cc2). The branch is c (5) and c2 (which is position 1 again). So positions 4 connected to 5 and 1. Then the O is attached to position 5. Wait, no. The O is outside the branch, so after the branch, the O would be attached to position 4. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the substituent in B: c2ccc(cc2)O. Breaking down:\n\nStart with c2 (position 1). Then three c's: positions 2, 3, 4. At position 4, there's a branch (cc2). The branch is c (position 5) and c2 (position 1). Then after the branch, the O is attached to position 4. So the benzene ring would have positions 1-6 connected as 1-2-3-4-5-1 (from the branch), but that would make a five-membered ring, which isn't possible. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent in B is written as c2ccc(cc2)O, which is equivalent to Oc1ccc(cc1) where the oxygen is attached to position 4. Wait, maybe not. Another approach: use a SMILES parser or consider that the order of writing substituents doesn't affect the structure as long as the connectivity is the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent in B is a benzene ring where the oxygen is attached to position 5. But then how does that compare to A's substituent, which has the oxygen at position 4. If the oxygen is in different positions on the benzene ring, then the molecules are different. But if they are in the same position, just written differently in SMILES, then they are the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the SMILES for the substituent in B is actually equivalent to A's. For example, in A: c2ccc(O)cc2. Positions 1,2,3,4 (O), 5,6. In B: c2ccc(cc2)O. Let's see:\n\nc2 (position 1), then c (position 2), c (position 3), c (position 4). Then (cc2) which would be position 5 connected to c (position 5) and c2 (position 1). Then O is attached to position 5. So the benzene ring would have positions 1-2-3-4-5-6 (but where is the O?). Alternatively, this could be a different arrangement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent in B is written as c2ccc(cc2)O, which is the same as O-c1ccc(cc1). That would be a benzene ring with the oxygen in the para position (position 4). Wait, O-c1ccc(cc1) is O attached to position 1, and the ring is 1-2-3-4-5-6-1. Then the substituent would be at position 4? Or maybe position 1. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two SMILES for the substituent are actually the same structure. Because SMILES can be written in different orders but represent the same molecule. For example, the substituent in A is -c2ccc(O)cc2, which is a benzene ring with O at position 4. The substituent in B is -c2ccc(cc2)O. Let's parse B's substituent again. Starting with c2 (position 1), then three c's (positions 2,3,4). At position 4, there's a branch (cc2). The branch is two more c's (positions 5 and 6), but since it's a ring closure (c2), position 6 would connect back to position 1. Then the O is attached to position 4. Wait, that would make the benzene ring have the O at position 4, same as in A. So maybe the substituent is the same. Therefore, the entire molecule would be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that the order of substituents around the sulfur doesn't matter because they're all single bonds. The two benzene substituents are the same, just written in different orders. So the entire molecules are the same.\n\nWait, but wait, the sulfur in Molecule A has the substituents O (from O=S), then =O, then NCCCCCO, then the benzene ring. In Molecule B, the substituents are NCCCCCO, benzene ring, and then =O. But since the order of single-bond substituents around the sulfur doesn't matter, they should be the same. The double bonds are both attached to sulfur, so that's the same. The rest are single bonds, so the order in SMILES doesn't affect the structure.\n\nTherefore, the two molecules are the same, so the answer should be Yes.",

So, I should parse both SMILES and check their structures.\n\nMolecule A: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2Cl)oc2c1ccc1ccccc12\nMolecule B: c1(-c2c(Cl)cccc2)cc(=O)c2c(c3c(cc2)cccc3)o1\n\nLet me start by breaking down each SMILES to understand their structure.\n\nFor Molecule A:\n- The SMILES starts with O=, which is a ketone group (C=O).\n- Then we have c1cc... which is a benzene ring (c1cc...).\n- The next part is -c2ccccc2Cl, which is a chlorine-substituted benzene ring attached as a substituent. The Cl is on the benzene ring (c2ccccc2Cl).\n- The 'oc2c1ccc1ccccc12' part seems a bit complex. The 'o' here could be an oxygen in a ring. Let me parse it step by step. After the first benzene ring (c1), there's an oxygen (o) connected to another ring (c2). The numbering here might be a bit tricky. The 'c2c1ccc1ccccc12' suggests that the second ring (c2) is fused to the first ring (c1), creating a bicyclic system. The 'ccc1ccccc12' part probably forms another fused benzene ring. So maybe this is a tricyclic structure with a ketone group.\n\nFor Molecule B:\n- The SMILES starts with c1(...) which is another benzene ring.\n- The substituent here is -c2c(Cl)cccc2, which is again a benzene ring with Cl attached. Wait, in SMILES, the order matters. The substituent here is a benzene ring where the Cl is on the second carbon (since it's c2c(Cl)cccc2). Wait, let me clarify. The part c2c(Cl)cccc2 would form a benzene ring where the Cl is attached to the second carbon. So the Cl is in the ortho position relative to the point of attachment to the main ring.\n- Then the main ring has a cc(=O) group, which is a ketone (C=O).\n- The next part is c2c(...)o1. So, the main ring (c1) is connected to another ring (c2) via a carbon. The 'c(c3c(cc2)cccc3)' part suggests that this c2 ring is connected to another benzene ring (c3). Let me parse this: the c2 is part of a ring that's connected to c3. The 'c3c(cc2)cccc3' would form a benzene ring (c3) fused to the c2 ring. So again, a fused bicyclic system here. The oxygen is part of the main ring (o1), making it an oxygen-containing ring, possibly a furan or similar.\n\nNow, comparing the two structures:\n\nMolecule A has a ketone group (O=) attached to a tricyclic system: a benzene ring fused to another oxygen-containing ring (like a benzofuran), which is further fused to another benzene ring. The substituent is a chlorobenzene group attached to the first ring.\n\nMolecule B's structure starts with a benzene ring (c1) that has a substituent which is a chlorobenzene (Cl on the second carbon of the benzene substituent). The main ring has a ketone (cc(=O)), and then a fused ring system involving c2 and c3. The oxygen is part of the main ring (o1), so perhaps the main ring is a furan derivative.\n\nWait, the main ring in Molecule B is c1, which starts with a substituent (-c2...), then cc(=O), then c2c(...)o1. The o1 suggests that the main ring (c1) includes an oxygen atom. So, the main ring might be a five-membered ring with oxygen (like furan), connected to other rings.\n\nBut in Molecule A, the main ring is a benzene ring (six-membered) with oxygen in another ring. Let me try to draw both structures mentally.\n\nFor Molecule A:\n- The core is a benzene ring (c1) with a ketone group (O=). Then, there's an oxygen in a fused ring (oc2c1...). The 'oc2c1' suggests that the oxygen is part of a ring (like furan) fused to the benzene. Then, the 'ccc1ccccc12' part adds another fused benzene ring. So perhaps this is a dibenzofuran structure with a ketone group and a chlorobenzene substituent.\n\nWait, dibenzofuran is two benzene rings fused to a central furan ring. If there's a ketone on the benzene, that might be a substituent. But in this case, the SMILES starts with O=c1cc..., so the ketone is on the first carbon of the benzene ring. Then, there's a substituent (-c2ccccc2Cl), which is a chlorobenzene attached to the benzene ring. Then, the oxygen is part of a fused ring. So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone, a chlorophenyl group, and fused to a dibenzofuran-like system.\n\nFor Molecule B:\nThe main ring (c1) has a substituent (-c2c(Cl)cccc2), which is a benzene ring with Cl attached to the second carbon (since c2 is followed by c(Cl)). Then, the main ring has a ketone (cc(=O)), and then a fused ring system. The c2c(...)o1 suggests that the main ring (c1) is connected to a c2 ring, which is part of another fused ring (c3). The oxygen is part of the main ring (o1), making the main ring a five-membered ring (like furan). So the main structure might be a chlorophenyl-substituted benzofuran with a ketone and another fused benzene ring.\n\nNow, to check if these are the same, I need to see if the connectivity is the same, despite the different SMILES ordering.\n\nAnother approach is to canonicalize both SMILES. If their canonical SMILES are identical, then they are the same molecule. However, since I can't run a canonicalization algorithm here, I have to do it manually.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for equivalent substructures. Let's compare substituents and rings.\n\nIn Molecule A, the substituent is a chlorobenzene (-c2ccccc2Cl). In SMILES, the position of the chlorine is on the benzene ring. The SMILES notation for substituents can vary in the order of atoms, but the actual position depends on the numbering. However, in SMILES, branches are written in a way that the first atom after the branch is adjacent to the atom it's attached to. So in Molecule A's substituent, the Cl is on the benzene ring at a position determined by the SMILES string. Similarly, in Molecule B, the substituent is -c2c(Cl)cccc2. Let's parse that: the substituent benzene ring (c2) starts with a carbon connected to Cl (c(Cl)), then continues cccc2. So the Cl is on the second carbon of the substituent benzene ring. However, benzene rings are symmetric, so depending on where the attachment is, the position of Cl might be equivalent.\n\nWait, the substituent in Molecule A is a benzene ring with Cl attached. The SMILES for that substituent is c2ccccc2Cl. Since SMILES is written in a circular manner, the Cl could be in any position. However, the actual position relative to the point of attachment matters. Let's say the substituent is attached to the main ring at position X. The Cl in the substituent benzene could be in a position relative to X. In Molecule A's substituent, the Cl is at the end of the benzene ring's SMILES string, which would typically mean it's in the para position relative to the point of attachment. For example, if the substituent benzene is written as c2ccccc2Cl, the Cl is on the fourth carbon when the attachment is on the first. So the substituent would have Cl in the para position.\n\nIn Molecule B's substituent, the substituent benzene is written as c2c(Cl)cccc2. Here, the Cl is on the second carbon of the benzene ring. If the attachment is on the first carbon, then the Cl is on the adjacent carbon (ortho position). But benzene rings can rotate, so depending on the attachment, the position might be equivalent. Wait, no. The positions (ortho, meta, para) are fixed relative to the point of attachment. If in one case the Cl is ortho and in the other para, they are different isomers. Therefore, if the substituent in Molecule A has Cl in para position and Molecule B has Cl in ortho, they are different molecules.\n\nBut wait, I need to be precise. Let's model the substituent benzene rings.\n\nFor Molecule A's substituent: -c2ccccc2Cl.\n\nStarting with the point of attachment (the first c2), the benzene ring is written as c2 followed by c, c, c, c, c, Cl. Let's number the substituent benzene ring as follows: the attachment point is position 1. Then the SMILES string is 1 (c2), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (c), 6 (c), and Cl attached to position 6. Wait, no. The SMILES for the substituent is c2ccccc2Cl. Let's parse this correctly. The substituent is a benzene ring where the Cl is attached. The SMILES is written as c2 (start), then each subsequent atom is connected in a ring. The Cl is attached to the last carbon in the SMILES string. So the substituent benzene is:\n\nCarbon 1: attached to the main ring.\nCarbon 2: connected to Carbon 1.\nCarbon 3: connected to Carbon 2.\nCarbon 4: connected to Carbon 3.\nCarbon 5: connected to Carbon 4.\nCarbon 6: connected to Carbon 5 and Carbon 1 (to close the ring).\nCl is attached to Carbon 6.\n\nSo in this substituent benzene ring, the Cl is on Carbon 6, which is para to the attachment point (Carbon 1). Because in a benzene ring, Carbon 1 and Carbon 4 are para, but wait, the numbering would be 1 (attachment), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So Carbon 6 is adjacent to Carbon 5 and Carbon 1. Therefore, the Cl is attached to Carbon 6, which is meta to the attachment point (Carbon 1)? Wait, no. In benzene, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), 1 and 3 are meta, 1 and 4 are para. Wait, but if the benzene ring is numbered 1 (attachment), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (with 6 connected back to 1), then Carbon 6 is adjacent to Carbon 5 and Carbon 1. So the Cl on Carbon 6 is adjacent to Carbon 1 (ortho). Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when you have a benzene ring in SMILES, the order of atoms determines their positions. Let's take the substituent in Molecule A: -c2ccccc2Cl. The SMILES starts at the point of attachment (the first c2), then each 'c' represents a carbon in the ring. The 'Cl' is outside the ring closure. So the SMILES would be:\n\nStart at c2 (position 1), then connect to c (position 2), then c (position 3), c (position 4), c (position 5), c (position 6), then close the ring with c2 (so position 6 connects back to position 1). Then the Cl is attached to position 6. Therefore, the Cl is on position 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (since position 6 is connected to position 5 and position 1). Therefore, the Cl is ortho to the attachment point (position 1). Wait, but position 1 is attached to the main ring. So the Cl is on the ortho position relative to where the substituent is attached.\n\nIn Molecule B's substituent: -c2c(Cl)cccc2. Let's parse this. The substituent starts at c2 (position 1), then the next atom is c(Cl) (position 2), followed by c (position 3), c (position 4), c (position 5), c (position 6), and close the ring with c2 (connecting position 6 back to position 1). So the Cl is attached to position 2. Therefore, in this substituent benzene ring, the Cl is on position 2, which is adjacent to position 1 (the attachment point), making it ortho as well. Wait, but wait. If the substituent is attached at position 1, and Cl is at position 2, that's ortho. But in Molecule A's substituent, the Cl is at position 6, which is adjacent to position 1, so also ortho. Therefore, both substituents have Cl in the ortho position relative to the attachment point. However, depending on the direction of the SMILES string, the actual positions might differ. Wait, benzene rings are symmetric, so if the substituent is attached at position 1, and Cl is at position 2 or position 6, those are equivalent because benzene is symmetric. Because in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1 and are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. So in this case, the Cl in Molecule A's substituent is on position 6 (ortho), and in Molecule B's substituent, it's on position 2 (ortho), but because the benzene ring can rotate, these are actually the same structure. Wait, no. Because when you attach a substituent to a benzene ring, the positions are fixed relative to the point of attachment. However, if the substituent is in the ortho position, but on adjacent carbons, but the ring is symmetric, then they might be considered the same. Wait, but in reality, if you have a benzene ring attached to another structure at position 1, and Cl at position 2 or 6, those are actually the same because rotating the ring 180 degrees would make them equivalent. For example, if you have a benzene ring with attachment at position 1 and Cl at 2, rotating the ring so that position 1 stays fixed would make the Cl move to position 6. Therefore, in this case, the substituent Cl positions in both molecules are equivalent. So the substituents are the same.\n\nNow, moving on to the core structure. Molecule A's core starts with O=c1cc... which indicates a ketone attached to a benzene ring. The rest of the structure is a fused ring system involving an oxygen atom. Molecule B's core starts with c1(...)cc(=O)... which also has a ketone. The main ring in B includes an oxygen (o1), suggesting a five-membered ring (like furan) fused to other rings.\n\nWait, let's try to map out the rings.\n\nMolecule A: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2Cl)oc2c1ccc1ccccc12\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- The main ring (c1) starts with O= (so a ketone at position 1). Then positions 2 and 3 are carbons (cc), with a substituent at position 3 (-c2ccccc2Cl). Then, position 4 is an oxygen (o), followed by c2c1..., which indicates a fused ring. The 'oc2c1' suggests that the oxygen is part of a ring (c2), which is fused to c1. Then, the structure c1ccc1ccccc12 implies a fused bicyclic system. It's a bit confusing, but perhaps it's a benzofuran moiety fused to another benzene ring. The numbering here might be leading to a tricyclic system.\n\nMolecule B: c1(-c2c(Cl)cccc2)cc(=O)c2c(c3c(cc2)cccc3)o1\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- The main ring (c1) has a substituent (-c2c(Cl)cccc2) at position 1. Then positions 2 and 3 are carbons with a ketone (cc(=O)). Then, position 4 is a carbon connected to another ring (c2). The 'c2c(...)o1' suggests that this is part of a fused ring. The 'c3c(cc2)cccc3' part forms another fused benzene ring. The oxygen is at position 5 (o1), making the main ring a five-membered ring (positions 1 to 5). So the main ring is a furan (with O at position 5) fused to another benzene ring (c2 and c3).\n\nWait, if the main ring is c1, and the SMILES is c1(...)cc(=O)c2...o1, then the main ring has 5 members: positions 1 (substituent), 2 (carbon), 3 (carbon with ketone), 4 (carbon connected to c2), and 5 (oxygen). So a five-membered ring: positions 1-2-3-4-5 (O), which is a furan ring. Then, this furan is fused to another ring (c2 and c3), forming a benzofuran-like structure, which is further fused to another benzene ring (c3). So the core structure is a dibenzofuran with a ketone substituent.\n\nWait, but dibenzofuran is two benzene rings fused to a central furan. If Molecule B has a ketone on the furan ring, that would make it a ketone-substituted dibenzofuran. Whereas Molecule A starts with a benzene ring (c1) with a ketone, fused to a benzofuran and another benzene.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Another approach is to count the number of rings and their fusion points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both SMILES strings represent the same structure but written in different orders. For example, the ketone group could be in the same position but written differently in the SMILES string. The substituent's Cl is in equivalent positions due to benzene symmetry, so they're the same. The fused rings might be arranged similarly but written with different numbering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the core structures are different. For instance, one might have a ketone on a benzene ring, and the other on a furan ring. But looking closely:\n\nMolecule A's ketone is O=c1..., which is a ketone on the first carbon of the benzene ring (c1). Molecule B's ketone is cc(=O), which is on the third carbon of the main ring (which is a furan). Wait, in Molecule B, the main ring is a furan (positions 1-5), and the ketone is at position 3 (cc(=O)). So the ketone is on the furan ring. Whereas in Molecule A, the ketone is on a benzene ring.\n\nIf the ketone is on different rings (benzene vs. furan), then the molecules are different. But that depends on whether the SMILES strings actually place the ketone on the same atom.\n\nWait, let's re-examine:\n\nMolecule A: O=c1cc(...)oc2c1...\n\nHere, the 'O=' is attached to c1, which is the first atom of the first ring. So the ketone is on the benzene ring.\n\nMolecule B: c1(...)cc(=O)...\n\nHere, the main ring (c1) has the ketone at the third position (cc(=O)). If the main ring is a five-membered furan, then the ketone would be on a carbon adjacent to the oxygen. But a furan is five-membered, so positions would be 1 (substituent), 2 (carbon), 3 (carbon with ketone), 4 (carbon connected to c2), 5 (oxygen), and back to 1. So the ketone is on position 3 of the furan ring.\n\nIn contrast, Molecule A's ketone is on a benzene ring. If the core structures have the ketone on different rings (benzene vs. furan), then they are different molecules.\n\nTherefore, if the ketone is attached to a benzene ring in one and to a furan ring in the other, the molecules are different. Hence, the answer would be \"No\".\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the rings. Let me try again.\n\nMolecule A: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2Cl)oc2c1ccc1ccccc12\n\nThe first ring (c1) starts with O=C. So carbon 1 has a ketone. Then, positions 2 and 3 are carbons. At position 3, there's a substituent (-c2...Cl). Then, position 4 is an oxygen (o) connected to c2. Then, the rest of the structure is c2c1ccc1ccccc12. This suggests that the oxygen is part of a ring (c2) fused to the first ring (c1). The 'c1ccc1ccccc12' part implies another fused benzene ring. So the entire structure is a tricyclic system: a benzene ring (c1) fused to a furan-like ring (c2, with oxygen), which is further fused to another benzene ring (the last part). The ketone is on the first benzene ring.\n\nMolecule B: c1(-c2c(Cl)cccc2)cc(=O)c2c(c3c(cc2)cccc3)o1\n\nThe main ring (c1) starts with a substituent, then has carbons leading to a ketone (cc(=O)), then a carbon connected to another ring (c2), which is part of a fused system. The oxygen is at the end (o1), making the main ring a five-membered furan. The ketone here is on the main furan ring. The fused rings include a benzene ring (c3).\n\nIf the ketone is on a benzene ring in A and on a furan ring in B, then the molecules are different. Hence, the answer is \"No\".\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting the ring positions. Let me try to draw it mentally for both.\n\nIn Molecule A:\n\n- Ring 1: Benzene (c1) with ketone at C1, substituent at C3 (chlorophenyl), and oxygen at C4 connected to Ring 2 (furan-like).\n- Ring 2: Fused to Ring 1, possibly a five-membered ring with oxygen.\n- Ring 3: Fused to Ring 2, another benzene ring.\n\nIn Molecule B:\n\n- Main ring is a five-membered furan (positions 1-5: substituent at C1, ketone at C3, oxygen at C5).\n- Fused to this furan is a benzene ring (from c2 and c3), making a benzofuran.\n- The substituent chlorophenyl is on C1 of the furan.\n\nBut in Molecule A, the ketone is on the benzene ring (Ring 1), while in B, it's on the furan ring. These are different positions, so the molecules are not the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"No\".",

Let's take them one by one.\n\nMolecule A: NC(=O)OC(CCN1CCN(c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2)CC1)c1ccccc1\nMolecule B: c1ccccc1C(CCN1CCN(c2ccc(cc2)[N+]([O-])=O)CC1)OC(=O)N\n\nFirst, I'll parse both SMILES to understand their structures. SMILES can sometimes look different due to the order of atoms or the way branches are written, but they might still be the same molecule.\n\nStarting with Molecule A. The main chain seems to be a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to a carbon which is connected to an oxygen (O), then a carbonyl group (C=O) with an amino group (N). The rest is a bit complex: the central carbon (attached to O) is connected to a chain CCN1CCN(...)CC1. The part inside the N-substituent is a nitro group [N+](=O)[O-] attached to a benzene ring (c2ccc(...)cc2).\n\nNow, Molecule B starts with the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to a carbon. Then we have C(CCN1CCN(...)CC1)OC(=O)N. The nitro group here is written as [N+]([O-])=O. Wait, nitro groups in SMILES can be written as [N+](=O)[O-] or [N+]([O-])=O. Are these equivalent? Yes, because the nitro group is a resonance structure where the double bond can be between N and O, and the charges are the same. So the order of the atoms in the nitro group doesn't change the structure; it's still a nitro group.\n\nLooking at the substituents in the benzene rings. In Molecule A, the nitro is on the benzene ring at position c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2. That would be the para position, right? Because the nitro is in the fourth position. In Molecule B, the benzene ring is c2ccc(cc2)[N+]([O-])=O. Wait, that might be the same. Let's see: the SMILES for a benzene ring with a nitro group in the para position can be written as c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1. But in Molecule B, it's written as c2ccc(cc2)[N+]([O-])=O. Hmm, that might actually be a meta position? Let me count. If the ring is written as c2ccc(cc2), that's positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. The nitro is attached where? Let's parse the SMILES. The ring starts with c2, then three c's (positions 2,3,4?), then a cc2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is at position 4. Let me draw this mentally. The SMILES c2ccc(cc2)[N+](...) would have the nitro group attached at the fourth carbon of the benzene ring. Because the ring starts with c2, then three carbons (positions 1,2,3?), then a connection. Wait, SMILES notation builds the ring as you go. Let's parse c2ccc(cc2)[N+](...). The benzene ring starts at c2, then three more carbons (so positions 1,2,3?), then (cc2) which would be positions 4 and 5, and back to position 2? Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is at position 4. Because in SMILES, when you have a ring closure, the position is determined by the order. Let's take c2ccc(cc2) as an example. The first atom is c2. Then three c's (so atoms 3,4,5?), then a (c c2), meaning the next two atoms are connected back to atom 2. Wait, maybe the nitro is attached to the fourth carbon. Let me think: the SMILES for a benzene ring with a nitro group in the para position would typically be written as c1ccc(cc1)[N+](=O)[O-], which would place the nitro at position 4. In Molecule B, the SMILES is c2ccc(cc2)[N+](...), which would attach the nitro group to position 4 of the benzene ring. So that's the same as in Molecule A. So both nitro groups are in the para position. So that's the same.\n\nNow, looking at the main chain. Molecule A starts with NC(=O)O-C(...), whereas Molecule B has OC(=O)N at the end. Wait, in SMILES, the order matters in terms of how the groups are attached. Let's see. For Molecule A: The structure is NC(=O)OC(...), which is an oxygen connected to the carbonyl group (C=O) and then to the central carbon. The central carbon is attached to the benzene ring and the chain CCN1CCN(...)CC1. In Molecule B, the structure is C(...)OC(=O)N. So the central carbon is connected to the benzene ring, then the chain, then the OC(=O)N group. The OC(=O)N group would be the same as O-C(=O)-N, which is the same as the NC(=O)O- group in A, but written in reverse order. Wait, but in SMILES, the directionality matters. For example, OC(=O)N is O connected to C(=O), which is connected to N. While NC(=O)O is N connected to C(=O), connected to O. Are these the same? No, wait. Because in the first case, the O is the carbonyl oxygen, and the other O is part of the ester or amide group. Wait, no. Let's clarify. NC(=O)O would be an N connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is then connected to an O. But that O would need to be connected to something else. Wait, in Molecule A, the SMILES is NC(=O)OC(...), so the O after the carbonyl is connected to the central carbon. So the structure is N-C(=O)-O-C(...). In Molecule B, the structure is C(...)OC(=O)N, which would be C(...)-O-C(=O)-N. So the O is connected to the central carbon and to the C(=O)N group. So that's the same as in Molecule A, just written in reverse. Because in SMILES, the order can sometimes be reversed. For example, if you have a chain like C-O-C(=O)-N, that's the same as N-C(=O)-O-C, as the connectivity is the same. So the direction in which you write the SMILES doesn't change the structure as long as the connectivity is the same. So in this case, the groups are connected in the same way but written in reverse order. Therefore, the OC(=O)N in B is the same as the NC(=O)O in A when attached to the same central carbon. So that part is the same.\n\nNext, the chain CCN1CCN(...)CC1. In Molecule A, it's C(CCN1CCN(...)CC1), and in B, it's C(CCN1CCN(...)CC1). The structure here is a cyclopropane? Wait, no. The part after CCN is 1CCN(...)CC1. So that's a ring closure. Let's parse the ring notation. For example, in A, CCN1CCN(...)CC1: the first C is part of the main chain (CC), then the N is connected to a ring closure 1. The ring starts at N1, then CC, then N(...), then CC1. So the ring is N1-C-C-N(...)-C-C-1, forming a six-membered ring? Wait, N1 is connected to C-C-N, which is connected back to C-C-1. Wait, that would be a six-membered ring: N1 connected to C, then another C, then N (with substituents), then C, then C, then back to N1. Wait, perhaps a piperazine-like ring. Let's count: positions N1, C2, C3, N4 (with substituent), C5, C6, back to N1. So a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. That's correct. The same in both molecules. The substituent on the N4 is the benzene ring with nitro group. So that's the same in both cases.\n\nPutting it all together, the only differences in the SMILES are the order of writing the nitro group and the order of the OC(=O)N group. Since SMILES allows different writing orders as long as the connectivity is the same, these two SMILES should represent the same molecule. The nitro group's notation is just a different way of writing the same thing, and the OC(=O)N vs NC(=O)O is a matter of writing direction, but the actual connectivity is the same. Therefore, the answer should be Yes.",

Let me start by analyzing each SMILES structure step by step.\n\nFirst, Molecule A: O=C1NC(=O)C(=Cc2ccc(-c3cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c3)o2)S1. Let's break this down. The main structure is a ring. The SMILES starts with O=C1, which suggests a carbonyl group attached to position 1 of a ring. Then there's NC(=O), so an amide group (NH-C=O) connected to the same ring. Next is C(=Cc2ccc(...)o2), which is a carbon double-bonded to a carbon chain. That chain leads to another ring (c2ccc...) with an oxygen atom (o2), indicating a furan or similar ring. The substituent on the second ring is -c3cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c3, which is a nitro group attached to a benzene ring. The nitro group is written as [N+](=O)[O-], which is correct. Finally, the ring is closed with S1, indicating a sulfur atom in the ring. So the main ring in Molecule A is a 5-membered ring with O=C, NH-C=O, S, and a double bond to the substituted benzene-furan group.\n\nNow, Molecule B: C1(SC(NC1=O)=O)=Cc1oc(-c2cccc([N+]([O-])=O)c2)cc1. Breaking this down. The main ring here starts with C1, which is part of a ring closure. The groups attached to C1 are SC(NC1=O)=O. Wait, the structure here might be a bit different. The sulfur is attached to C1, then a C connected to S has a carbonyl group (C=O) and an amide group (NC1=O). The main chain is =Cc1oc(...)cc1. The c1 here is another ring, likely a furan (since there's an 'o' in the ring). The substituent is -c2cccc([N+]([O-])=O)c2, which again is a nitro group on a benzene ring. The nitro group here is written as [N+]([O-])=O, which is equivalent to the one in Molecule A, just the order of the atoms in the nitro is written differently, but that's the same group.\n\nComparing the two SMILES, the key is to see if the connectivity and the rings are the same. Molecule A's main ring is O=C1-N-C(=O)-C(=C)-S1, making a 5-membered ring with O, N, C=O, S, and the double bond to the substituent. Molecule B's main ring starts with C1, which is connected to S, then a carbonyl group (C=O) and an amide (NC1=O). Wait, the arrangement might be different. Let me draw both structures mentally.\n\nIn Molecule A, the ring is likely a five-membered ring with positions 1: O=C, 2: N, 3: C(=O), 4: C(=C), and 5: S. The substituent is attached via the double bond from position 4 to the furan ring with the nitrobenzene group.\n\nIn Molecule B, the main ring is C1 connected to S, then C(SC...)=C. The ring structure might be similar but written in a different order. SMILES strings can vary depending on the starting point and the direction of traversal. For example, the ring could be written starting from a different atom but still represent the same structure. Also, the nitro group in Molecule B is written as [N+]([O-])=O, which is the same as [N+](=O)[O-], just a different ordering in the SMILES notation. The nitro group's representation doesn't affect the actual structure because the resonance structure is the same.\n\nAnother thing to check is the substituent on the furan ring. In Molecule A, it's -c3cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c3, which is a benzene ring with a nitro group. In Molecule B, it's -c2cccc([N+]([O-])=O)c2, which is the same benzene ring with nitro, just the nitro's SMILES is written with the oxygen's charge order reversed. But SMILES allows different orderings of the atoms in such groups as long as the connectivity and charges are correct, so they are equivalent.\n\nThe main potential difference is the arrangement of the main ring. Let's compare the ring atoms. In Molecule A: the ring is O=C1-N-C(=O)-C(=C)-S1. So positions 1 (O=C), 2 (N), 3 (C=O), 4 (C=), 5 (S). The substituent is at position 4 via the double bond. In Molecule B: the ring is C1(SC(...)=O)=C... Let's parse it again. The main ring in B starts with C1. Then SC(NC1=O)=O is attached to C1. Wait, perhaps the main ring is C1 connected to S, which is connected to C, which is connected to NC1=O. So the ring would be C1-S-C-N-C(=O)-C1? Or maybe it's a different arrangement. Let me try to write the SMILES for Molecule B step by step.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES: C1(SC(NC1=O)=O)=Cc1oc(...)cc1. Let's parse the main ring. The first part is C1(SC(...)=O)=O). The C1 is part of a ring closure. The groups attached to C1 are S, which is connected to C. That C has a carbonyl group (=O) and another group NC1=O. Wait, NC1=O would connect back to the first C1, forming a ring. So the ring would be C1 connected to S, then to C(=O), then to N connected to C1=O. So the ring would be C1-S-C(=O)-N-C1=O. That makes a five-membered ring: C1 (connected to S), S connected to C(=O), which is connected to N, which is connected back to C1 via a carbonyl (C1=O). Wait, that would form a 4-membered ring? Because C1 is connected to S, then S to C(=O), then C to N, then N to C1. That's a four-membered ring: C1-S-C(=O)-N-C1. But that seems a bit strained. Alternatively, maybe I'm misparsing the SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, the SMILES could be C1(SC(NC1=O)=O)=C... So the C1 is part of a ring. The substituents on C1 are: S attached to a C, which has a carbonyl group (=O) and an amide group (NC1=O). The NC1=O implies that the N is connected to C1, which is part of the ring. So the ring would be C1 connected to S, then the S is connected to C(=O) and NC1=O. Wait, perhaps the ring is C1-S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C1? No, that would be a five-membered ring. Let me try to write the sequence:\n\nC1 is the first atom. It has a substituent S-C(...)=O. The S is connected to a C, which has two groups: a carbonyl (=O) and another group NC1=O. The NC1=O connects back to the original C1. So the ring would be C1-S-C(=O)-N-C1=O. So the ring is five-membered: C1, S, C(=O), N, C1=O. Wait, that's a five-membered ring where C1 is connected to S, S to C(=O), C to N, N to C1=O. So the ring atoms are C1, S, C, N, O? Wait, no, because C1=O is a carbonyl. So the ring would be C1-S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C1? That's a five-membered ring with C1, S, C, N, C(=O), and back to C1. Hmm, but that would require the ring closure to be between C1 and the N's adjacent C? I'm getting confused. Maybe I should visualize it differently.\n\nAlternatively, the main ring in Molecule B could be a five-membered ring with the atoms C1, S, C, N, and another C, arranged in a ring. The substituents would be the double bond to the furan group and the carbonyl groups. Comparing this to Molecule A's ring, which has O=C1, N, C(=O), C(=C), and S. So in Molecule A, the ring starts with a carbonyl oxygen, while in Molecule B, the ring starts with a carbon (C1) connected to S and other groups. The key question is whether these two SMILES strings are different representations of the same structure.\n\nAnother approach is to canonicalize both SMILES. Since SMILES can be written in different ways but represent the same molecule when canonicalized. However, without a tool, I need to check manually. Let's see:\n\nIn Molecule A: The main ring has O=C1, N, C(=O), C(=C), and S. The substituent is a double bond to a furan ring with a nitrobenzene group.\n\nIn Molecule B: The main ring starts with C1 connected to S, then a C(=O) and an amide (NC1=O). The substituent is a double bond to a furan ring with nitrobenzene. So if the main ring in B is a five-membered ring with S, C(=O), N, and carbonyl groups, arranged such that it's equivalent to A's ring, then they are the same. But the order of the atoms in the ring might be different. For example, if the ring in A is O=C1-N-C(=O)-C(=C)-S1, and the ring in B is C1-S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C1, that's a different arrangement. Wait, but the substituents need to match. Alternatively, maybe the rings are the same but written in a different order.\n\nAlternatively, the rings might be different. For example, in A, the ring includes an oxygen (O=C1), whereas in B, the starting atom is a carbon (C1). But oxygen in the ring would make it a different structure unless it's part of the ring. Wait, in Molecule A, the O is part of the ring. The SMILES starts with O=C1, which means the oxygen is double-bonded to C1, and C1 is part of the ring. So the ring is O=C1-N-C(=O)-C(=C)-S1. That would form a five-membered ring with atoms O, C1, N, C2 (with =O), C3 (with =C), and S. Wait, but that's five atoms? O=C1 is the first atom, then N connected to C1, then C(=O) connected to N, then C(=C) connected to the previous C, then S connected to that C and back to C1. So the ring is O=C1-N-C(=O)-C(=C)-S1. That's a five-membered ring with O, C1, N, C, C, S? No, wait, the ring would be O=C1 connected to N, which is connected to C(=O), which is connected to C(=C), which is connected to S, which connects back to C1. So the ring is O=C1-N-C(=O)-C(=C)-S-C1. Wait, but that would make a six-membered ring. Wait, no, because O=C1 is part of the ring. Let me count the atoms in the ring:\n\n1. O (as O=C1)\n2. C1\n3. N\n4. C (from C(=O))\n5. C (from C(=C))\n6. S\nThen back to C1. That's six members? But the SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to indicate closure. For example, O=C1...S1 means that the first and sixth atoms form a ring. Wait, the '1' in O=C1 and S1 indicates that C1 is connected to O and S. So the ring is O=C1-N-C(=O)-C(=C)-S-C1. That's a six-membered ring: O, C1, N, C, C, S, back to C1. Wait, that's six atoms. But in Molecule B, the main ring is C1(SC...)=O, etc. Let's check Molecule B's ring.\n\nMolecule B's main ring: C1(SC(NC1=O)=O)=C... So C1 is connected to S, which is connected to C. That C has a =O and a NC1=O group. So the C is connected to S, O, and N. The N is connected to C1=O. So the ring would be C1-S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C1. That's a five-membered ring: C1, S, C(=O), N, C(=O), back to C1. Wait, that's five atoms? C1 connected to S, S to C(=O), C to N, N to C(=O), which is connected back to C1. So the ring is C1-S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C1. Wait, that's a five-membered ring? Let me count: C1, S, C, N, C, back to C1. But that would be a five-membered ring only if the last C is connected directly to C1. But the way the SMILES is written might form a five-membered ring. However, this would mean the ring has C1, S, C, N, and C(=O) connected back to C1, making a five-membered ring.\n\nComparing the two rings: Molecule A's ring has six members (O, C1, N, C, C, S), while Molecule B's ring has five members (C1, S, C, N, C(=O)). That would mean they are different structures. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in parsing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the ring sizes. Let me re-express Molecule A's SMILES as O=C1N(C(=O)C(=Cc2ccc(-c3cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c3)o2)S1. Wait, the SMILES is O=C1NC(=O)C(=Cc2ccc(...)o2)S1. Breaking it down:\n\n- O=C1: the first atom is O double-bonded to C1, which is part of a ring.\n- N: next atom is N connected to C1.\n- C(=O): then a C connected to N and double-bonded to O.\n- C(=C...): then a C connected to the previous C and double-bonded to another C that leads to the furan substituent.\n- S1: S connected to the previous C and back to C1 to close the ring.\n\nSo the ring members are O=C1, N, C(=O), C, C(=C...), and S connected back to C1. That's six atoms in the ring: O, C1, N, C, C, S.\n\nIn Molecule B, the main ring is C1 connected to S, which is connected to C(=O) and N connected back to C1 via a carbonyl. So the ring would be C1-S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C1. Wait, that's five atoms: C1, S, C, N, C(=O). But that can't form a ring unless the last C is connected back to C1. Wait, the SMILES is C1(SC(NC1=O)=O)=C... So the C1 is part of a ring closure. The substituents on C1 are S connected to C, which has =O and NC1=O. The NC1=O implies that the N is connected to C1. So the ring would be C1 connected to S, then S connected to C(=O), which is connected to N, which is connected back to C1 via a carbonyl (C1=O). So the ring is C1-S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C1. Wait, that's five atoms: C1, S, C, N, C(=O), and then back to C1. So the ring has five members: C1, S, C, N, O (from the carbonyl). But the carbonyl is a double bond, so the ring would be five-membered with a carbonyl. However, this is possible.\n\nSo in Molecule A, the main ring is six-membered (O, C1, N, C, C, S), while in Molecule B, the main ring is five-membered (C1, S, C, N, O). Therefore, they have different ring sizes, which means the molecules are not the same. But wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me verify again.\n\nIn Molecule A: The ring starts with O=C1, then N, then C(=O), then C, then C(=C...), then S, and back to C1. That's six atoms: O, C1, N, C, C, S.\n\nIn Molecule B: The ring is C1 connected to S, then C(=O), then N connected to C1=O. So the ring would be C1-S-C(=O)-N-C1=O. Wait, that's four atoms: C1, S, C, N, back to C1. But that would make a four-membered ring, which is possible but less likely. Alternatively, the SMILES might be written in a way that the ring closure is different. Let me try to parse Molecule B again.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES: C1(SC(NC1=O)=O)=Cc1oc(-c2cccc([N+]([O-])=O)c2)cc1.\n\nBreaking down the main ring part: C1(SC(...)=O)=O. The C1 is the first atom in the ring. The groups attached to C1 are S and another group. The S is connected to a C, which has (=O) and NC1=O. The NC1=O means that the N is connected to C1. So the ring is C1 connected to S, which is connected to C(=O), which is connected to N, which is connected back to C1 via a carbonyl (C1=O). So the ring atoms are C1, S, C, N, and O (from the carbonyl). Wait, but that's four atoms: C1, S, C, N, back to C1. But how does that form a ring? If it's C1-S-C(=O)-N-C1=O, then the ring is C1-S-C-N-C1, which is a five-membered ring? Wait, no. C1 is connected to S (bond 1), S to C (bond 2), C to N (bond 3), N to C1 (bond 4). So the ring is four-membered: C1, S, C, N. But the carbonyl groups are substituents, not part of the ring. That would make a four-membered ring, which is possible but less common. However, a four-membered ring with S, C, N might be strained.\n\nIn contrast, Molecule A's ring is six-membered. If the main rings are different in size, then the molecules are different. Therefore, the answer should be No. But I need to make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the SMILES notation. Let's consider another approach: numbering. In SMILES, the same number indicates the closure. So in Molecule A, O=C1...S1 means that the ring closure is between the first atom (C1) and the S. In Molecule B, C1(...)S... indicates that the closure is between the first C1 and another part. Wait, maybe in Molecule B, the main ring is a five-membered ring. Let's try to write the SMILES as a ring:\n\nC1 is the starting point. It has two substituents: S attached to a C (which has =O and NC1=O), and another substituent which is =C... So the ring is C1 connected to S, which is connected to C(=O), which is connected to N, which is connected back to C1 via a carbonyl (C1=O). So the ring would be C1-S-C(=O)-N-C(=O)-C1. Wait, that's six atoms? No, that would be C1, S, C, O, N, C(=O), back to C1. But that's not a proper ring. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is C1-S-C(=O)-N-C1=O. That would be a five-membered ring: C1, S, C, O, N, back to C1. But that's five atoms. However, SMILES allows for rings to be formed by closing numbers. For example, if C1 is the first atom and then later in the string another C1 closes the ring. So in Molecule B, the main ring is formed by C1(...) and then another C1. But the exact connectivity depends on the order.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Another way is to consider that SMILES strings can represent the same molecule even if written differently. For example, different starting points or different traversal orders can lead to different SMILES but the same structure. However, without canonicalization, it's hard to tell. But given that the main rings have different sizes (six-membered vs. five-membered or four-membered), they are different molecules.\n\nAdditionally, the substituents seem similar: both have a nitrobenzene group attached to a furan ring, connected via a double bond. But if the main rings are different, then the molecules are different.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Let's start by looking at both structures carefully. \n\nMolecule A: CN(C)CCCn1c(N)c(-c2nc3ccccc3s2)c2nc(C#N)c(C#N)nc21.\nMolecule B: c1cccc2c1nc(s2)-c1c(N)n(CCCN(C)C)c2c1nc(C#N)c(n2)C#N.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse both SMILES to visualize their structures. SMILES can sometimes be written in different orders but still represent the same molecule. The key is to check if the connectivity and the arrangement of atoms and bonds are identical, possibly considering different starting points or ring numbering.\n\nStarting with Molecule A: The main structure seems to have a central ring. Let's break it down. The part 'CN(C)CCCN1...' suggests a propyl chain (three carbons) connected to a nitrogen which is part of a ring. The ring is probably a bicyclic system. The substituents on the ring include an amino group (N), a substituent '-c2nc3ccccc3s2' which is a thiophene ring (since s2 is in a five-membered ring with two carbons adjacent to the sulfur). Then there are two cyano groups (C#N) attached to another ring, perhaps a pyrimidine-like ring.\n\nMolecule B starts with a benzene ring: 'c1cccc2c1nc(s2)...' which might be a benzothiazole or similar. Then there's a substituent '-c1c(N)n(CCCN(C)C)...' which includes an amino group (N) attached to a ring, and a propyl chain similar to A's. The rest of the structure also has two cyano groups attached to a ring.\n\nWait, perhaps the rings are arranged differently. Let me compare the substituents. Both have a propyl chain (CCCN(C)C) connected to a nitrogen in a ring. Both have an amino group (N), a thiophene or similar sulfur-containing ring, and two cyano groups. \n\nBut the way the rings are connected might differ. Let me try to number the rings. \n\nIn Molecule A: The central ring is n1c(...)c(...)nc21, which suggests a bicyclic system, maybe a 6-5 fused ring. The substituents are attached at positions 1, 2, etc. \n\nIn Molecule B: The structure starts with a benzene ring (c1cccc2c1), then a thiophene-like part (nc(s2)), then a substituent leading into another ring with the propyl chain and cyano groups. \n\nWait, perhaps the core structure is the same but written in a different order. SMILES can be written starting from different atoms, which might change the order but represent the same molecule. The key is to check if all the substituents are in the same positions. \n\nLet me try to canonicalize both SMILES. If they are the same, their canonical SMILES would be identical. But since I don't have a tool here, I'll have to do it manually. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only difference is the direction in which the rings are written. For example, in A, the substituent order might be different than in B. Let's see:\n\nIn Molecule A, the central ring is n1c(N)c(...)c2nc(C#N)c(C#N)nc21. So the nitrogen is at position 1, followed by the amino group, then the thiophene substituent, then another ring part with two cyano groups.\n\nIn Molecule B, the substituent order is -c1c(N)n(CCCN(C)C)c2c1nc(C#N)c(n2)C#N. Here, the amino is on the same ring as the propyl chain. The cyano groups are attached to positions in a ring that's fused.\n\nThis might be the same structure but written with different starting points. For instance, the bicyclic system could be represented differently depending on the starting atom. Also, the thiophene group in A is connected via a '-c2...' while in B it's part of a benzothiazole-like structure.\n\nWait, in Molecule B: The part 'c1cccc2c1nc(s2)' suggests a benzene ring (positions 1-6) fused to a thiazole ring (positions 2, 7, 8, 9, 10?), with the sulfur in position 8. Then this thiazole is connected via a single bond to the rest of the molecule. \n\nIn Molecule A, the substituent '-c2nc3ccccc3s2' would form a thiophene ring (since it's c2 connected to sulfur at position 3?), perhaps. Wait, the SMILES notation here might be a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. \n\nThe substituent in A is -c2nc3ccccc3s2. So starting from the central ring's carbon, which is connected to a nitrogen (c2), then a ring closure (c3ccccc3s2). Wait, that would form a five-membered ring: c2 is connected to n, then c3, then three more carbons, then sulfur, then back to c2. So that's a five-membered ring with two carbons, then three more (but wait, the count might be off). Let's see: the sequence is c2 n c3 c c c c c3 s2. So c2 is connected to n, then c3, then four carbons (c c c c), then c3 again (which is the same as the third atom in the ring?), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's try to break it down:\n\nThe substituent in A is -c2nc3ccccc3s2. So:\n\n- The central ring's carbon is connected to a benzene ring or similar. Let's see:\n\nc2 is the first atom in this substituent's ring. Then n (nitrogen) connected to c2. Then c3 (which starts another ring). Then the sequence c c c c c (five carbons?), then c3 again (closing the ring between c3 and the third atom?), then s2 (sulfur connected back to c2). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe this is a thiophene ring? Because sulfur is in a five-membered ring. Let's imagine: c2 is connected to n, then to c3. The ring closure is c3 followed by four carbons (c c c c) and then s2. Wait, that would form a six-membered ring? Or maybe it's a benzene ring with sulfur. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzothiophene? Or maybe a thiophene ring fused to another ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a thiophene with substituents. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent in A is a thiophene ring (five-membered with sulfur), where the substituent is attached to the thiophene. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to compare the substituents in both molecules.\n\nMolecule A's substituent: -c2nc3ccccc3s2. This would form a ring where c2 is connected to n, which is connected to c3, then a chain of four carbons (c c c c), then back to c3, and then sulfur connecting back to c2. Wait, that would create a 6-membered ring? Because c3 is part of a ring closure. Let's count: c2 is connected to n, which connects to c3. Then c3 connects to four carbons (c, c, c, c), then connects back to c3 (ring closure), and then s2 connects back to c2. So the ring would be c2-n-c3-c-c-c-c-s2. That's seven atoms? No, wait, the c3 is connected to the next c, which is connected to the next, etc. Wait, perhaps this is a benzene ring (six-membered) with a sulfur. Wait, maybe it's a benzothiazole? Because there's a nitrogen and sulfur in the ring. Let me count again. The substituent is written as -c2nc3ccccc3s2. So starting at c2, then n, then c3, then four carbons (c, c, c, c), then back to c3 (ring closure), then s connected back to c2. That makes the ring sequence: c2-n-c3-c-c-c-c-c3-s2. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe there's a typo in the SMILES? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let's try again. The part after the '-c2' is 'nc3ccccc3s2'. So the sequence is: c2 connected to n, then c3, then four carbons (c c c c), then c3 (ring closure), then s2 (connecting back to c2). So the ring would be c2-n-c3-c-c-c-c-c3-s2. But that's a 7-membered ring, which seems unlikely. Maybe it's a typo and should be 'nc3cccc3s2' instead of 'ccccc3'? Let's check the original input again.\n\nOriginal Molecule A: ...c(-c2nc3ccccc3s2)... So the substituent is a group attached to the central ring, which is '-c2nc3ccccc3s2'. So the substituent is a ring where c2 is connected to n, then c3, followed by four carbons (c c c c), then back to c3 (ring closure), and then s connected back to c2. That would form a 7-membered ring: c2-n-c3-c-c-c-c-c3-s2. Hmm, that's odd. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is written with a mistake, or perhaps I'm miscounting. Let's see: 'nc3ccccc3' would be a benzene ring. So the substituent would be c2 connected to n, which is part of a benzene ring (c3ccccc3), and then s connected to c2. So the ring would be c2 connected to n, which is part of a benzene ring (c3 connected to n and then five more carbons), and then s connected back to c2. That would create a five-membered ring with c2, n, c3, and two other carbons, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a thiophene ring (five-membered) with a nitrogen. Wait, maybe the substituent is a thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine or something, but I'm not sure. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the fact that both molecules have similar substituents: a propyl chain with dimethylamine (CN(C)CCC...), an amino group (N), a sulfur-containing ring (thiophene or similar), and two cyano groups. If the connectivity is the same, then they are the same molecule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the core rings are different. For example, in Molecule A, the central structure could be a bicyclic system where the propyl chain is attached to a nitrogen in one ring, and the substituents (thiophene, cyano groups) are attached to adjacent positions. In Molecule B, the core might start with a benzene ring fused to a thiazole, then connected to the rest of the structure. \n\nWait, let's parse Molecule B's SMILES step by step:\n\nc1cccc2c1nc(s2)-c1c(N)n(CCCN(C)C)c2c1nc(C#N)c(n2)C#N.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is c1cccc2c1nc(s2): This is a benzene ring (c1cccc2) fused to a ring that includes the 'nc(s2)' part. So positions 1-6 form a benzene ring, with position 2 connected to another ring. The 'nc(s2)' suggests a five-membered ring with nitrogen, carbon, sulfur. So perhaps a benzothiazole group. The substituent after the hyphen is '-c1c(N)n(CCCN(C)C)c2c1nc(C#N)c(n2)C#N'. \n\nThis part starts with a carbon connected to a ring (c1), which has a substituent c(N) (amino group), then n connected to the propyl chain (CCCN(C)C). Then there's another ring closure with c2c1, meaning a fused ring. The rest includes two cyano groups. \n\nPutting it all together, Molecule B seems to have a benzothiazole group connected via a single bond to another bicyclic system that includes the propyl chain and cyano groups. \n\nIn comparison, Molecule A's structure has a central bicyclic system with the propyl chain attached to a nitrogen, and the substituents including a thiophene-like ring and cyano groups. \n\nThe key difference might be whether the sulfur is part of a benzothiazole (as in B) or a thiophene (as in A). Wait, in A's substituent, there's a sulfur in the ring, but in B, the sulfur is part of the benzothiazole. If the sulfur-containing rings are different, then the molecules are different. \n\nBut wait, in Molecule A's substituent '-c2nc3ccccc3s2', perhaps it's a benzothiophene or a similar structure. However, if in A the substituent is a thiophene (five-membered with sulfur), and in B it's a benzothiazole (benzene fused to a thiazole, which is six-membered), then the structures would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are the same. For example, if the substituent in A is a benzothiazole and the way it's written in SMILES is different due to the starting point, but in reality, it's the same as B's. \n\nBut given the SMILES strings provided, I need to check if the connectivity is the same. \n\nAnother approach: count the number of rings and their sizes. Molecule A has rings in the substituent (the thiophene or benzothiophene) and the central bicyclic system. Molecule B has a benzothiazole and another bicyclic system. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire structure is the same but written in a different order. For example, the propyl chain in A is attached to a nitrogen in a ring, and in B it's the same but written starting from a different atom. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to imagine the structures. \n\nMolecule A: The central bicyclic ring has a nitrogen connected to the propyl chain (CN(C)CCC...). Attached to this ring is an amino group, a substituent (the thiophene or benzothiophene), and another ring with two cyano groups. \n\nMolecule B: A benzothiazole (benzene fused to thiazole) connected to a bicyclic ring that has the propyl chain, amino group, and two cyano groups. \n\nIf the core structure is different (benzothiazole vs. another arrangement), then they are different. \n\nAlternatively, if the substituent in A is a thiophene and in B it's a benzothiazole, then they are different. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider canonicalizing the SMILES. Since I can't do that here, I'll have to make an educated guess. \n\nAnother point: the order of substituents on the rings. In SMILES, the order can vary, but the actual structure depends on the positions. For example, if two substituents are adjacent in one SMILES but separated in another, they are different molecules. \n\nIn Molecule A's central ring: the substituents are N, the thiophene group, and the cyano rings. \n\nIn Molecule B's structure, after the benzothiazole, the substituent is a ring with amino, propyl chain, and cyano groups. \n\nIf the connectivity is such that the benzothiazole in B is part of the central ring system in A, then they could be the same. But if the benzothiazole is a substituent in B and part of the core in A, then they might differ. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES are different representations of the same molecule due to different ring numbering or starting points. \n\nWait, let's look at the cyano groups. Both molecules have two cyano groups. In A, they are on a ring as 'c2nc(C#N)c(C#N)nc21'. In B, 'c2c1nc(C#N)c(n2)C#N'. So the positions might be equivalent. \n\nThe propyl chain in A is 'CN(C)CCCn1...' which is N,N-dimethylpropylamine connected to a nitrogen in the ring. In B, 'n(CCCN(C)C)' is a nitrogen connected to the propyl chain (CCCN(C)C), which is the same as in A. \n\nThe amino group in A is 'c(N)', and in B, it's 'c(N)'. So the positions might be the same. \n\nThe key difference is the sulfur-containing ring. In A, it's part of the substituent '-c2nc3ccccc3s2', which is a six-membered ring (if the c3 is part of a benzene ring), but with sulfur. Wait, the substituent in A: c2 connected to n, then c3, which is part of a benzene ring (ccccc3), then sulfur connected back to c2. So that would form a six-membered ring with a sulfur and a nitrogen. That would be a thiazine or similar. Alternatively, if the ring is six-membered with sulfur and nitrogen, perhaps it's a different heterocycle. \n\nBut in Molecule B, the sulfur is part of a benzothiazole (benzene fused to a thiazole). \n\nIf the sulfur-containing rings are different between A and B, then the molecules are different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for the sulfur-containing group in A is actually a benzothiazole, but written in a different order. For example, 'c2nc3ccccc3s2' could represent a benzene ring fused to a thiazole. Let's see: c2 is connected to n, then c3 (part of a benzene ring: cccccc3), then s2. Wait, that would form a benzene ring fused to a thiazole. The thiazole would have nitrogen at position 2 and sulfur at position 5, for example. So the substituent in A might be a benzothiazole group. \n\nIf that's the case, then both A and B have a benzothiazole substituent. Then the rest of the structure would need to be compared. \n\nThe rest of the structures in A and B include a bicyclic ring system with the propyl chain, amino group, and two cyano groups. If those are arranged the same way, then the molecules are identical. \n\nBut the SMILES for the bicyclic systems might be written differently. For example, in A, the central ring is written as n1c(...)c(...)nc21, forming a fused ring. In B, the ring is part of the substituent after the benzothiazole, written as '-c1c(N)n(CCCN(C)C)c2c1nc(C#N)c(n2)C#N'. \n\nIf these two parts are actually the same bicyclic system but written with different starting points, then the molecules are the same. Otherwise, they are different. \n\nLet me try to parse the bicyclic system in B: '-c1c(N)n(CCCN(C)C)c2c1nc(C#N)c(n2)C#N'. Starting from the hyphen, the structure is:\n\n- c1 (connected to the benzothiazole via a single bond)\n- c1 has substituents: c(N) (amino), n(CCCN(C)C) (propyl chain), and c2 (ring closure)\n- c2 is part of the same ring as c1, and has substituents nc(C#N) (cyano) and c(n2)C#N (another cyano)\n\nThis seems to form a bicyclic system where c1 and c2 are part of two fused rings. \n\nIn A, the central ring is n1c(...)c(...)c2nc(C#N)c(C#N)nc21. So the bicyclic system here has a nitrogen at position 1, then substituents, then a fused ring with the cyano groups. \n\nIf these two bicyclic systems are the same but written in reverse order, then the molecules could be identical. \n\nAlternatively, if the connectivity is different (e.g., the position of the amino group relative to the propyl chain), then they are different. \n\nThis is quite complex without visualizing the structures. Given the time I've spent and the possibility that the SMILES are different representations of the same molecule, I'll have to make a judgment. \n\nAnother approach: check if the molecular formulas are the same. Let's count the atoms:\n\nMolecule A: \n- CN(C)CCCn1c(N)c(...)c2nc(C#N)c(C#N)nc21\nBreaking down:\nC, N, (C) -> dimethylamine: C2H7N\nCCCC (four carbons from CCCn)\nn (nitrogen)\nThen parts from the rings: the substituent has a sulfur (from s2), and the rest includes cyano groups (C#N) which contribute C and N each. \n\nBut this is time-consuming. Alternatively, both molecules should have the same number of each atom if they are the same. \n\nMolecule A has:\n- From CN(C)CCC: 1 C (from C in CN), N, then (C) which is another C, then CCC. So that's 1 + 1 (from C in (C)) + 3 C's = 5 C's, 1 N in CN(C), plus the rest. \n\nBut this is error-prone. Alternatively, let's count all atoms:\n\nMolecule A SMILES: CN(C)CCCn1c(N)c(-c2nc3ccccc3s2)c2nc(C#N)c(C#N)nc21\n\nAtoms:\n- C: let's count each occurrence.\n- N: each N in the formula.\n- S: from s2.\n- C#N: each contributes one C and one N.\n\nStarting with the first part: CN(C)CCCn1...\n\nC (from C), N, (C) (another C), then CCC (3 C's), n (N), 1 (ring closure).\n\nThen c(N) (C and N), then c(-c2...), etc.\n\nThis is tedious. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is the same for both. Let's check Molecule B's SMILES:\n\nc1cccc2c1nc(s2)-c1c(N)n(CCCN(C)C)c2c1nc(C#N)c(n2)C#N.\n\nCount atoms:\n\nCarbons: many. But key points: two C#N groups in both. One sulfur in both. The rest should have the same number of C, N, S. \n\nAssuming the count is the same, then maybe they are the same. But if there's a difference in the rings, like one has an extra carbon, they'd be different. \n\nAlternatively, since both have two C#N, one S, similar N counts (dimethylamine group, amino group, nitrogens in rings), maybe the formulas are the same. \n\nBut even if the formulas are the same, the structures could be different. \n\nAnother thought: perhaps the SMILES are canonicalized differently but represent the same structure. For example, the order in which the rings are closed or the direction of writing might differ. \n\nGiven the complexity, I'm leaning towards the molecules being the same, just written with different SMILES conventions. Therefore, the answer would be \"Yes\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine if Molecule A and Molecule B are the same based on their SMILES strings.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Molecule A: COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1C(=O)OCCN1CCC(C(N)=O)CC1. Breaking it down, there's a methoxy group (COc), then a benzene ring with substituents: amino (N), chlorine (Cl), and a carbonyl group attached to an ethoxy chain (C(=O)OCC...). The ethoxy part connects to a piperazine ring (N1CCC...) where one of the carbons has a C(N)=O group. Wait, the C(N)=O might be an amide group. Let me check: C(N)=O would be a carbamoyl group? Or maybe it's written as NC(=O)? Because usually, amides are written as N-C=O. Hmm, the SMILES here is C(N)=O, which would be O=C(N), which is a carboxamide group. But the order matters. Let me parse that again. For the part in the ring: CCC(C(N)=O)CC1. So the ring is N1 connected to C-C-C, then a carbon attached to C(N)=O. So the substituent on the piperazine is a carbonyl group connected to an amino group. So that's NC(=O), right?\n\nNow Molecule B: O=C(OCCN1CCC(C(=O)N)CC1)c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N. Let's parse this. The main part starts with O=C(OCC...), which is a carbonyl (probably a ester or amide). The ester group is OCCN..., which connects to the same piperazine ring as Molecule A. The ring here is N1CCC(C(=O)N)CC1. So the substituent on the piperazine is C(=O)N, which is an amide group (N attached to carbonyl). That's the same as in Molecule A, just written in a different order. SMILES can sometimes have different representations for the same group because of the order of atoms, but they are equivalent. For example, C(=O)N and NC(=O) are the same. So that part is the same.\n\nThen, the other part of Molecule B is the benzene ring: c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N. Let's break that down. The benzene ring has substituents: OC (methoxy), Cl, and N (amino). The positions are important. The SMILES notation for the ring is c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N. Let's index the benzene ring positions. The first carbon (position 1) has OC (methoxy) attached. Then, positions 2, 3, 4: the next parts are cc( which would be positions 2 and 3. Wait, SMILES notation builds the ring by connecting the atoms in order. Let me draw it out. The benzene ring is written as c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N. Starting at position 1 (the first c in c1), then position 2 is c(OC), so methoxy at position 2. Then positions 3 and 4 are cc, so maybe positions 3 and 4. Then position 5 is c(c1)Cl, which is attached to position 5 (since c1 refers back to position 1). Wait, that's confusing. Let me try numbering:\n\nThe benzene ring is written as c1 (position 1) followed by c(OC) (position 2, with methoxy), then cc (positions 3 and 4), then c(c1)Cl (position 5, connected back to position 1, so that would create a ring closure between position 5 and 1? Wait, maybe I need to parse the SMILES more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the benzene ring in Molecule B is arranged as follows: the substituents are at positions 2 (OCH3), 4 (Cl), and 5 (NH2)? Wait, let me try to write it step by step. \n\nThe SMILES for the benzene part in B is: c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N. Let's parse this as:\n\n- Start with c1 (position 1)\n- Next atom is c(OC) (position 2), connected to position 1. This has a methoxy group (OC, which is OCH3)\n- Then two carbons (cc), positions 3 and 4, connected in a chain.\n- Then comes c(c1)Cl (position 5), which connects back to position 1. Wait, that would close the ring between position 5 and 1. But position 5 is connected to Cl. Then the next N is attached to which position?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write the benzene ring as positions 1 through 6. Let's see:\n\nThe SMILES for the benzene in B is: c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nc1: start the ring here (position 1)\nc(OC): next atom (position 2), with a methoxy group\nc: position 3\nc: position 4\n( then we have c(c1)Cl: this is position 5. The c here is connected back to position 1 (c1), meaning position 5 is connected to position 1. Then Cl is attached to position 5. Then the N is attached to position 6 (the next position after position 5). \n\nWait, but after position 4 comes the part (c(c1)Cl)N. So the sequence is:\n\npositions 1 (c1), 2 (c-O-C), 3 (c), 4 (c), then a branch starting at position 4? Or perhaps:\n\nWait, the SMILES is: c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N.\n\nSo after c1 (position 1), position 2 is c(OC), then positions 3 and 4 are c and c. Then, the next part is a branch starting with c(c1)Cl. The c here would be connected to position 4. Then this c (position 5) is connected back to position 1 (c1) and has Cl attached. Then the N is attached to position 5? Or to position 6?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the benzene ring is structured as follows:\n\nPositions:\n\n1: connected to position 2 and 5 (because of the c1 and the later c(c1))\n\n2: connected to 1 and 3, with OCH3 substituent\n\n3: connected to 2 and 4\n\n4: connected to 3 and 5\n\n5: connected to 4 and 1, with Cl substituent\n\n6: connected to 5 and the N group?\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's easier to draw the SMILES step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's compare the substituents on the benzene ring in both molecules.\n\nMolecule A's benzene ring: COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1...\n\nSo the benzene ring has substituents at positions:\n\n- The first C in the ring is attached to OCH3 (COc1...), which would be position 1.\n\nThen, the next parts are cc(N)c(Cl)cc1. So positions 2 (c), 3 (c(N)), 4 (c(Cl)), 5 (c), 6 (c), then back to position 1. Wait, SMILES notation builds the ring in order. Let me parse this correctly.\n\nThe SMILES for A's benzene is: COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nCOc1: the OCH3 is attached to position 1 of the benzene ring.\n\nThen, the next atoms are cc(N)c(Cl)cc1.\n\nSo positions:\n\n1: OCH3\n\n2: c (connected to position 1)\n\n3: c (connected to position 2) with a NH2 group (N)\n\n4: c (connected to position 3) with Cl\n\n5: c (connected to position 4)\n\n6: c (connected to position 5 and back to position 1 via the ring closure)\n\nSo substituents are at positions 1 (OCH3), 3 (NH2), 4 (Cl). Wait, that can't be right. Let me number again.\n\nWait, the benzene ring in SMILES is written as COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1. So:\n\n- COc1: the benzene starts at position 1 with OCH3.\n\nThen, the next atoms are cc(N)c(Cl)cc1.\n\nSo:\n\nPosition 1: OCH3 (from COc1)\n\nPosition 2: c connected to position 1.\n\nPosition 3: c connected to position 2. Then (N) is a substituent here, so position 3 has NH2.\n\nPosition 4: c connected to position 3. Then (Cl) substituent here, so position 4 has Cl.\n\nPosition 5: c connected to position 4.\n\nPosition 6: c connected to position 5 and back to position 1 (via the 1 in cc1).\n\nSo substituents are at positions 1 (OCH3), 3 (NH2), 4 (Cl).\n\nNow, Molecule B's benzene ring is O=C(...)c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N.\n\nWait, the benzene ring part is c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N. Let's parse this:\n\nStart with c1 (position 1).\n\nThen c(OC) (position 2, OCH3).\n\nThen c (position 3).\n\nThen c (position 4).\n\nThen we have a branch: c(c1)Cl. This is a carbon (position 5) connected to position 4 and back to position 1 (c1), with Cl attached. Then the N is attached to position 5.\n\nWait, that would make the substituents:\n\nPosition 2: OCH3\n\nPosition 5: Cl and NH2?\n\nWait, the N is at the end of the SMILES string for the benzene part. Let me see:\n\nThe entire benzene part is c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- c1 (position 1)\n\n- c(OC) (position 2, OCH3)\n\n- c (position 3)\n\n- c (position 4)\n\n- then a branch: (c(c1)Cl). The c here is position 5, connected to position 4. Then c(c1) means position 5 is connected back to position 1 (c1), creating a ring closure. Then Cl is attached to position 5.\n\n- After the branch, we have N attached where? The N is after the branch, so it's connected to position 5. Because in SMILES, after a branch, the next atom is connected to the previous one. So after the branch (which is part of position 5), the N is attached to position 5. So position 5 has Cl and NH2 substituents?\n\nWait, but benzene can't have two substituents on the same carbon in this case. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's see:\n\nThe benzene ring in B is built as follows:\n\nPositions 1 (c1), 2 (c-O-C), 3 (c), 4 (c), then a branch: (c(c1)Cl). This branch starts at position 4. So position 4 connects to a new carbon (position 5), which is connected back to position 1 (c1) and has Cl. Then the N is attached to position 5. But benzene has six members. If position 5 is connected back to position 1, then positions 1-2-3-4-5-1 would form a six-membered ring? No, that's a five-membered ring. Wait, that can't be right. I must be making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, the SMILES notation for the benzene in B is:\n\nc1 (position 1) followed by c(OC) (position 2), then cc (positions 3 and 4), then a branch starting at position 4: c(c1)Cl. So the branch is a carbon connected to position 4 and back to position 1. Then the N is attached to that carbon. Wait, but that would create a five-membered ring, which isn't possible for benzene. This suggests I'm parsing it incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is structured such that the benzene ring is written with some branches. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire benzene ring:\n\nc1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N.\n\nStart with c1 (position 1).\n\nThen c(OC) (position 2, OCH3).\n\nThen c (position 3).\n\nThen c (position 4).\n\nThen, inside a branch, we have c(c1)Cl. This c is connected to position 4 (since it's after position 4 in the SMILES string) and back to position 1. So this would create a 5-membered ring? That can't be. So perhaps the benzene ring is actually built with the following connections:\n\nPositions 1 connected to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5 (from the branch), 5 to 1 (from c1), forming a five-membered ring. But benzene is six-membered. This suggests I'm making a mistake in parsing.\n\nWait, maybe the SMILES is c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N. Let's split this:\n\n- c1: start of ring 1.\n\n- c(OC): next atom, part of ring 1 (position 2), with OCH3.\n\n- c: position 3.\n\n- c: position 4.\n\n- (c(c1)Cl): a branch here. The first c in the branch is connected to position 4. Then this c (position 5) is connected to c1 (position 1) and has Cl. Then, after the branch, the N is attached to position 5.\n\nBut that would make the ring connections as 1-2-3-4-5-1, which is a five-membered ring. That's not possible for benzene, which must be six-membered. Therefore, I must be missing a carbon somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is written with the ring closure in a different way. Let's try to visualize:\n\nThe entire benzene ring in B's SMILES is:\n\nc1 (1) - c(OC) (2) - c (3) - c (4) - (branch: c (5) - c1 (1)) - Cl) - N.\n\nBut this creates a five-membered ring (1-2-3-4-5-1), which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my parsing.\n\nWait, perhaps the SMILES for the benzene ring in B is written as c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N. Let me try numbering the positions differently. Let's consider that the ring closure is between position 5 and position 1, making a six-membered ring.\n\nSo:\n\n1: connected to 2 and 6.\n\n2: OCH3, connected to 1 and 3.\n\n3: connected to 2 and 4.\n\n4: connected to 3 and 5.\n\n5: connected to 4 and 6.\n\n6: connected to 5 and 1, and has Cl and NH2 substituents.\n\nWait, but how does that happen? Let's see:\n\nThe SMILES string is c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N.\n\nBreaking it down step by step:\n\n- c1 (position 1)\n\n- c(OC) (position 2, OCH3)\n\n- c (position 3)\n\n- c (position 4)\n\n- then a branch: (c(c1)Cl). The c here is position 5, connected to position 4. Then, c(c1) connects position 5 back to position 1. Then Cl is attached to position 5.\n\n- After the branch, the N is attached to position 5.\n\nBut then the ring would be 1-2-3-4-5-1, which is five-membered. That can't be. So there's an error here. Alternatively, maybe the N is attached to position 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the benzene ring is written with some implicit hydrogens. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES for Molecule B's benzene is arranged with substituents at positions 2 (OCH3), 4 (Cl), and 6 (NH2). Let's see:\n\nIf the benzene ring is numbered 1 to 6, and substituents are at 2, 4, and 6, that would make them para and meta positions. But the actual positions need to match between A and B.\n\nIn Molecule A's benzene ring, substituents are at 1 (OCH3), 3 (NH2), and 4 (Cl). Wait, that's adjacent positions (1, 3, 4), which would be 1: OCH3, 3: NH2, 4: Cl. That's positions 1, 3, and 4. Wait, benzene is a ring, so position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. So substituents at 1,3,4 would have OCH3 at 1 (para to 4?), but this depends on the actual arrangement.\n\nIn Molecule B's benzene ring, if substituents are at 2 (OCH3), 5 (Cl), and 6 (NH2), then that's different from A. Or if substituents are at 2, 5, and 6.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should canonicalize both SMILES strings to compare them.\n\nBut since I don't have a tool here, I need to do it manually.\n\nAlternative approach: Check if the two SMILES strings are different representations of the same structure.\n\nMolecule A: COc1cc(N)c(Cl)cc1C(=O)OCCN1CCC(C(N)=O)CC1\n\nMolecule B: O=C(OCCN1CCC(C(=O)N)CC1)c1c(OC)cc(c(c1)Cl)N\n\nFirst, notice that the ester group in A is C(=O)OCCN..., while in B it's O=C(OCCN...). That's just a different way of writing the same group. SMILES can start from either end, so O=C(...) is the same as C(=O)...\n\nThe main chain in A is COc1...C(=O)OCCN..., which connects the benzene ring to the ester group, which connects to the piperazine ring.\n\nIn B, it's O=C(OCCN...)..., which is the same ester group. The benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl group (as in A).\n\nNow, looking at the benzene rings:\n\nA: substituents are OCH3 (position 1?), NH2 (position 3?), Cl (position 4?).\n\nB: substituents are OCH3 (position 2?), Cl (position 5?), NH2 (position 6?).\n\nWait, maybe the positions are different due to the way the SMILES is written. But SMILES strings can be written starting from any atom, so the numbering can vary but the actual structure is the same if the substituents are in the same relative positions.\n\nFor example, if the benzene ring in A has substituents at positions 1 (OCH3), 3 (NH2), and 4 (Cl), and the ring in B has substituents at positions 2 (OCH3), 5 (Cl), and 6 (NH2), these could be the same if the rings are rotated. But benzene is symmetrical, so the relative positions matter.\n\nIn benzene, substituents can be in positions that are adjacent (ortho), separated by one (meta), or opposite (para). Let's see:\n\nIn A's benzene: OCH3 at position 1, NH2 at 3, Cl at 4.\n\nPositions 1,3,4: 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6; 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4; 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. So substituents at 1,3,4 would have OCH3 at 1, NH2 at 3 (meta to OCH3), Cl at 4 (adjacent to NH2).\n\nIn B's benzene: OCH3 at 2, Cl at 5, NH2 at 6.\n\nWait, if the benzene is numbered differently, such as starting from a different position, the substituents could be in the same relative positions. For example, if in B's benzene, OCH3 is at position 2, Cl at 5, NH2 at 6. Then positions 2,5,6: 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3; 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6; 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. So substituents at 2,5,6 would be OCH3 (2), Cl (5), NH2 (6). The Cl and NH2 are adjacent (5 and 6), and OCH3 is two positions away from Cl (positions 2 to 5: 2-3-4-5, which is three positions apart, meta). That's different from A's arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, if in B's benzene, the substituents are OCH3 at position 2, Cl at 4, and NH2 at 5, then the relative positions would be similar to A's. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the benzene rings are actually the same when considering the positions. For example, if in A, the substituents are at positions 1 (OCH3), 3 (NH2), and 4 (Cl), and in B, they are at positions 2 (OCH3), 5 (Cl), and 6 (NH2), but when you flip the ring, the relative positions are the same. But benzene's symmetry allows certain permutations. For example, if you rotate the ring 180 degrees, positions 1 and 4 could swap, etc. But in this case, the substituents' arrangement must be the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES strings are written in a different order but represent the same molecule. For example, the ester group in A is C(=O)OCCN..., while in B it's O=C(OCCN...), which is the same. The piperazine ring in A is N1CCC(C(N)=O)CC1, and in B it's N1CCC(C(=O)N)CC1. The substituent on the piperazine is C(N)=O in A and C(=O)N in B. These are the same; SMILES doesn't distinguish the order here because it's the same group. So the piperazine parts are the same.\n\nThen the benzene rings: if the substituents are in the same relative positions, then the molecules are the same. If not, they're different.\n\nAssuming that the benzene rings have the same substituents in the same relative positions but written in a different order in the SMILES string, they could be the same. For example, if the benzene ring in A has OCH3, NH2, and Cl in positions that are equivalent to B's when the ring is rotated or numbered differently.\n\nTo confirm this, I need to determine if the substituent patterns are the same. For example, in A's benzene, the substituents are OCH3, NH2, and Cl. The positions are 1,3,4. In B's, they might be 2,5,6. But the relative positions between the substituents need to match.\n\nIn A's arrangement (positions 1,3,4):\n\n- OCH3 (1) is meta to NH2 (3) (two carbons apart).\n\n- NH2 (3) is adjacent to Cl (4).\n\n- OCH3 (1) is para to Cl (4)? No, position 1 to 4 is three carbons away, which is meta.\n\nWait, benzene positions: 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Position 4 is adjacent to 3 and 5. So OCH3 at 1, NH2 at 3, Cl at 4. The NH2 and Cl are adjacent (positions 3 and 4). OCH3 is two positions away from NH2 (1 to 3) and three positions away from Cl (1 to 4).\n\nIn B's arrangement, if substituents are at 2 (OCH3), 5 (Cl), 6 (NH2):\n\n- OCH3 (2) is adjacent to NH2 (6) via positions 2-1-6.\n\n- Cl (5) is adjacent to NH2 (6) at position 5-6.\n\n- OCH3 (2) is three positions away from Cl (5).\n\nThis arrangement would have OCH3 meta to Cl, and NH2 adjacent to both Cl and OCH3 (if 2 and 6 are adjacent via position 1). But in reality, positions 2 and 6 are not adjacent; they are separated by position 1.\n\nAlternatively, if in B's benzene, substituents are OCH3 at 2, Cl at 5, NH2 at 6:\n\n- OCH3 (2) is adjacent to position 1 and 3.\n\n- Cl (5) is adjacent to 4 and 6.\n\n- NH2 (6) is adjacent to 5 and 1.\n\nSo, OCH3 (2) is three positions away from Cl (5) (2-3-4-5), which is meta. Cl (5) is adjacent to NH2 (6). NH2 (6) is adjacent to OCH3 via position 1 (6-1-2), making them para to each other (positions 6 and 2 are opposite). So substituents are OCH3 (para to NH2), Cl adjacent to NH2. This is different from A's arrangement where OCH3 is meta to NH2 and Cl is adjacent to NH2.\n\nTherefore, the substituents' relative positions are different between A and B, making them different molecules.\n\nWait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe the benzene rings are the same but written in a different starting point. For example, if in A, the starting point is OCH3 at position 1, and in B, the starting point is the NH2 group. Let's see:\n\nIf in B's benzene, the substituents are OCH3 at position 2, Cl at 5, NH2 at 6, but if you renumber the ring starting from the NH2 group, then the positions might align with A's.\n\nFor example, if in B, NH2 is at position 6, which becomes position 1 when renumbered. Then OCH3 at position 2 becomes position 5, and Cl at position 5 becomes position 2. This might not align with A's arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are different representations of the same molecule due to different writing orders but the same structure.\n\nBut given the substituent positions I analyzed earlier, they seem to be different. For example, in A, the Cl is adjacent to NH2, while in B, Cl is adjacent to NH2 as well. Wait, no. Wait, in B's benzene, Cl is at position 5 and NH2 at 6, so they are adjacent. In A's benzene, Cl is at position 4 and NH2 at position 3, which are adjacent. So both have Cl and NH2 adjacent. Then OCH3 in A is at position 1, and in B at position 2. If the benzene rings are numbered differently, perhaps OCH3 in B's position 2 is equivalent to A's position 1 when the ring is rotated.\n\nBenzene is symmetric, so rotating the ring could make position 2 become position 1. For example, if you rotate the ring 60 degrees clockwise, position 2 becomes position 1. Then, substituents at positions 2,5,6 in B would be at positions 1,4,5 in the new numbering. But in A, substituents are at 1,3,4. So this doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, flipping the ring. If you mirror the ring, positions might swap. But the key is whether the substituents' relative positions are the same.\n\nIf in both molecules, the substituents are OCH3, NH2, and Cl, with NH2 and Cl adjacent, and OCH3 meta to Cl, then they would be the same. Let's check:\n\nIn A:\n\n- Cl at position 4 (adjacent to NH2 at 3).\n\n- OCH3 at position 1. Position 1 to Cl at 4: positions 1-2-3-4 (three bonds apart, meta).\n\nIn B:\n\n- Cl at position 5 (adjacent to NH2 at 6).\n\n- OCH3 at position 2. Position 2 to Cl at 5: positions 2-3-4-5 (three bonds apart, meta).\n\nSo both have Cl meta to OCH3 and adjacent to NH2. The relative positions are the same. Therefore, the benzene rings are identical, just numbered differently due to SMILES starting from different positions.\n\nTherefore, the two molecules are the same, differing only in the order of writing the SMILES string.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. The molecules given are:\n\nMolecule A: CSc1c(CC(=O)Nc2ccc(F)cc2)n(Cc2ccccc2)c2ccccc12\nMolecule B: c1(c(c2c(cccc2)n1Cc1ccccc1)SC)CC(Nc1ccc(F)cc1)=O\n\nFirst, I need to recall that SMILES strings can vary in the order of atoms and the starting point of the ring numbering, but they should still represent the same structure. So, my job is to determine if these two SMILES strings are different representations of the same molecule or if they actually have different structures.\n\nI'll start by breaking down each SMILES into their structural components. Let's look at Molecule A:\n\n- The SMILES starts with CS, which is a methylthio group (CH3-S-).\n- Then there's a ring denoted by c1... The numbers after the atoms indicate the ring closures. Let's parse the ring structure. The part after CS is c1c(...)n(...)c2ccccc12. So, the core is a bicyclic system. Let's see: The first ring (c1) has a substituent CC(=O)Nc2ccc(F)cc2, which is a propionamide group (CC(=O)N-) attached to a fluorophenyl ring (c2ccc(F)cc2). Then there's a nitrogen atom (n) substituted with a benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2). The second part of the ring is c2ccccc12, which suggests a benzene ring fused to the first ring. So, the core is a bicyclic system where one ring is aromatic (maybe a benzene or another heterocycle) fused to another ring that includes the sulfur and nitrogen.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES is a bit different in arrangement:\n\n- It starts with c1(...) which is a ring. The substituents here are c2c(cccc2)n1Cc1ccccc1, which seems like a fused ring system again. The SC group is attached, followed by CC(Nc1ccc(F)cc1)=O. The substituents here include a propionamide group (CC(=O)N-) attached to a fluorophenyl ring, similar to Molecule A. There's also a benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1) attached to a nitrogen atom in the ring.\n\nNow, the challenge is to see if both SMILES strings describe the same connectivity. Let's try to map the atoms.\n\nIn Molecule A, the core is a bicyclic system where the sulfur (from SC) is part of one ring, and the nitrogen (with the benzyl substituent) is part of the same ring. The propionamide group is attached to the sulfur-containing ring. The benzyl group is on the nitrogen in the ring.\n\nIn Molecule B, the core starts with a ring (c1) that has a substituent which includes another ring (c2c...n1C...). The SC group is attached to the first ring. The CC(=O)N- group is connected to the main structure, and the benzyl group is attached to the nitrogen in the fused ring.\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is in the arrangement of the rings. Let me try to draw this mentally. Both molecules have a bicyclic system with a sulfur and a nitrogen. The key is to check if the substituents are attached in the same positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES are written with different starting points. For example, in Molecule A, the starting point is the sulfur (CSc1...), whereas in Molecule B, the starting point is a benzene ring (c1...). The order of writing the substituents might differ, but the actual structure might be the same.\n\nAnother approach is to canonicalize both SMILES. Since SMILES can be written in different orders, converting them to canonical SMILES using a tool like RDKit would show if they are identical. However, since I can't actually run code here, I need to analyze manually.\n\nLet's parse the rings. In Molecule A, the first ring (c1) has:\n\n- A sulfur (from CSc1)\n- A carbon connected to CC(=O)N...\n- A nitrogen (n) with a benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2)\n- The ring closure with c2ccccc12, which is a fused benzene ring (since the numbers are 1 and 2). So, the core is a bicyclic system where the sulfur is in one ring, the nitrogen in another, and they are fused.\n\nIn Molecule B, the first ring (c1) has:\n\n- A substituent c2c(cccc2)n1Cc1ccccc1. Let's break this down. The c2c(cccc2) is a benzene ring (since c2c...cccc2 implies positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 in a ring). The n1C suggests that the nitrogen is part of ring 1 (the main ring) and is connected to a benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1). Then there's the SC group attached to the main ring, and the CC(=O)N... group.\n\nThis seems a bit complex, but perhaps the core structure is the same. Let me try to see if the substituents are the same:\n\nBoth have a benzyl group attached to a nitrogen (n(Cc...) in A, and n1C... in B. Both have a propionamide group (CC(=O)Nc...) attached. Both have a fluorophenyl group (Nc2ccc(F)cc2 in A and Nc1ccc(F)cc1 in B). The sulfur is part of the core structure in both (CSc1 in A, SC in B).\n\nThe key difference might be the arrangement of the rings. Let's imagine the bicyclic system. Suppose in Molecule A, the rings are a thiophene-like ring fused to a pyridine-like ring, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, it could be a benzothiophene fused to another ring with a nitrogen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the core is a benzothiophene (S in one ring) fused to a pyridine (N in the other ring), with substituents. But the exact arrangement might vary depending on the SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES are just different representations. For example, the starting point of the numbering might be different, leading to different atom orders but the same structure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the same substituents in the same positions. Both have the SC group (methylthio), the CC(=O)N-Ph-F group, and the benzyl group attached to nitrogen.\n\nIf all substituents are attached to the same atoms in the core structure, then the molecules are the same. The challenge is determining if the core structures are isomorphic despite different SMILES representations.\n\nLet me attempt to map the rings:\n\nIn Molecule A:\n- The first ring (c1) is connected to S, then a carbon with CC(=O)N..., a nitrogen with benzyl, and then fused to another benzene ring (c2ccccc12). So, the core is a bicyclic system where the first ring (c1) is a 6-membered ring (since it has c1c...n...c2ccccc12) but I'm not sure. Wait, the SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to indicate closure. So, in A, after the initial c1, there's a c(CC(=O)N...) then n(...), then c2ccccc12. The c2ccccc12 part suggests a benzene ring (six carbons) where the first and last atoms are connected (closure 1 and 2). So, the main ring (c1) has the sulfur, then the next atom is a carbon connected to CC(=O)N..., then a nitrogen, then a carbon that's part of another benzene ring (c2ccccc12). So the core structure is a bicyclic system where the sulfur is in one ring and the nitrogen in another, fused together.\n\nIn Molecule B, the SMILES starts with c1(...), which includes a c2c(...)n1C... So, the main ring (c1) has a substituent that includes another ring (c2). The c2c(cccc2) is a benzene ring (positions 1,2,3,4,5,6), and the n1C suggests that the nitrogen is part of the main ring (c1), connected to a benzyl group. Then there's the SC group attached to the main ring, and the CC(=O)N... group.\n\nThis seems similar to Molecule A. The main difference might be the order in which the substituents are listed, but the actual connectivity could be the same. The key is whether the sulfur and nitrogen are in the same positions relative to each other in the fused rings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are just different representations of the same molecule. For example, if the starting point of the ring numbering is different, the SMILES would look different but the molecule is the same. For instance, if in A the sulfur is at position 1 of the first ring, and in B the sulfur is at a different position, but due to the ring's symmetry, it's the same structure.\n\nBut without visualizing, it's hard to tell. Another approach is to note that the substituents are all the same: benzyl, methylthio, propionamide-fluorophenyl. The core is a fused bicyclic system with S and N. If the connectivity of these groups is the same, then the molecules are identical.\n\nAlternatively, if the nitrogen's position in the fused ring system is different (e.g., adjacent vs. opposite to sulfur), they would be different molecules.\n\nBut since the substituents are the same and the core is a fused ring system with the same substituents, perhaps they are the same. But I need to be careful.\n\nWait, let's try to write out the SMILES in a way that matches. Let's parse Molecule B step by step:\n\nMolecule B: c1(c(c2c(cccc2)n1Cc1ccccc1)SC)CC(Nc1ccc(F)cc1)=O\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- Start with c1(...) which is a ring.\n- Inside the parentheses: c(...)SC. So the first atom of the ring (c1) has substituents.\n- The c(...) part is c(c2c(cccc2)n1Cc1ccccc1). So, the first atom (c1) has a carbon connected to another ring (c2c(cccc2), which is a benzene ring (c2c(cccc2) \u2192 positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 forming a benzene). Then there's an n1C, which connects back to the main ring (n1, meaning the nitrogen is part of ring 1). Then Cc1ccccc1 is a benzyl group (C connected to a benzene ring).\n\nSo the main ring (c1) has a substituent that includes a benzene ring (c2) and a nitrogen connected to a benzyl group. Then the main ring also has SC attached (from the ...)SC part. The rest is CC(Nc1ccc(F)cc1)=O, which is the propionamide group connected to a fluorophenyl.\n\nComparing to Molecule A, which has CSc1c(...)n(...) etc. The core in A has the sulfur (S) attached to the first carbon of the ring, followed by a carbon with the propionamide group, then a nitrogen with benzyl, and fused to another benzene. In B, the sulfur is part of the substituent (SC) attached to the main ring. But maybe the main ring in B is the same as the fused system in A, just written starting from a different atom.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Another approach: count the number of rings and their sizes. Both molecules have two benzene rings (from the c2ccc(F)cc2 and Cc2ccccc2 in A, and similar in B). The core bicyclic system would be two fused rings, perhaps a 5-membered and a 6-membered, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the core could be a 5-membered ring with S and N fused to a benzene. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother way to check: In SMILES, the order of atoms matters, but different orderings can represent the same molecule if they are isomorphic. For example, if you start numbering the ring from a different atom, the SMILES will look different but the molecule is the same. So perhaps these two SMILES are just different representations of the same structure.\n\nAlternatively, if the connectivity is different, then they are different. For example, if the sulfur is attached to a different position relative to the nitrogen in the fused ring system, they would be different molecules.\n\nBut given that both have the same substituents (benzyl, methylthio, propionamide-fluorophenyl), and the same fused bicyclic core with S and N, it's possible they are the same. The different SMILES could be due to different starting points in the ring numbering or different orders of writing the substituents.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I think the two SMILES represent the same molecule. The answer should be \"Yes\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine if Molecule A and Molecule B are the same based on their SMILES strings. First, I'll recall that SMILES notation can sometimes represent the same molecule in different ways due to different starting points or ring numbering. So, the key is to analyze the connectivity and functional groups.\n\nStarting with Molecule A: COc1cccc(C(=O)OCC(C)C2CCC3C(O)CCCC23C)c1. Let's break this down. The main structure seems to be a benzene ring (denoted by 'c1cccc...c1') with substituents. The substituents are a methoxy group (COc1...), a carbonyl group (C(=O)O...), and an ester group attached via an ethyl chain. Then there's a more complex part: C(C)C2CCC3C(O)CCCC23C. This looks like a bicyclic structure, maybe a decalin system with a hydroxyl group (C(O)). The ester group (OCC(C)C...) connects to the bicyclic part.\n\nNow Molecule B: C1(C(COC(c2cc(ccc2)OC)=O)C)C2(C)CCCC(O)C2CC1. Let's parse this. The SMILES starts with a ring closure (C1...C1), which suggests a cyclic structure. The substituents here include a COC group attached to another benzene ring (c2cc(ccc2)OC), which is part of an ester (COC(...)=O). The main structure seems to involve two rings connected, perhaps a bicyclic system. The hydroxyl group (O) is present here as well, and there are methyl groups (C(C)) attached.\n\nComparing the two, both have a benzene ring with methoxy and ester substituents. The ester in A is OCC(C)C..., while in B, it's COC(...)=O connected to a chain. The bicyclic parts might be similar but arranged differently. The hydroxyl group is present in both. However, the connectivity could differ. For instance, in A, the ester is connected via an ethyl group (OCC(C)), whereas in B, the ester is directly attached to a carbon chain that's part of the bicyclic system. Also, the positions of substituents on the benzene rings might differ based on the SMILES notation. The numbering in SMILES can affect how the substituents are ordered, so maybe the positions of the methoxy and ester groups on the benzene are different. Additionally, the bicyclic structures might be enantiomers or diastereomers if the stereochemistry is different, but SMILES doesn't specify that unless stereochemical indicators are present. Checking both SMILES, I don't see any '@' symbols indicating stereochemistry, so maybe they're considered the same if the connectivity is identical despite different numbering. However, the way the rings are constructed in the SMILES could lead to different structures. For example, in A, the bicyclic part is C2CCC3..., while in B, it's C1(...)C2(...)CC1, which might form a different ring system. To confirm, I should try to draw both structures or use a SMILES parser to check if they are isomorphic. Since I can't do that manually, I'll have to analyze the connectivity. Both have a benzene ring with methoxy and ester groups, and a bicyclic system with a hydroxyl group. The ester groups might be in the same position, but the ring closures could be different. Alternatively, the SMILES might represent the same molecule but written in a different order. For instance, the ester in A is attached via OCC(C)C..., which in B is part of a longer chain connected to the bicyclic system. It's possible that these are the same when considering the overall connectivity but just written with different starting points. However, without a tool, it's tricky. Another approach: count the number of atoms. Both should have the same number of C, O, etc. Let's count:\n\nMolecule A: COc1cccc(C(=O)OCC(C)C2CCC3C(O)CCCC23C)c1\n\nBreaking down:\n- COc...: 1 C (from CO), O, then benzene ring (6 C)\n- C(=O)OCC(C): C=O (2 O), then O connected to CC(C) (which is O-C-C(C)-...)\n- C2CCC3C(O)CCCC23C: Ring 2 (C2...C2) and Ring 3 (C3...C3). The bicyclic system here.\n\nMolecule B: C1(C(COC(c2cc(ccc2)OC)=O)C)C2(C)CCCC(O)C2CC1\n\nBreaking down:\n- C1(...)CC1: Ring 1\n- COC(...)=O: ester group connected to benzene (c2cc(ccc2)OC)\n- C2(...)CCCC(O)C2: Ring 2 with hydroxyl.\n\nThis seems complex. The main issue is whether the core bicyclic structures are identical. In A, the bicyclic system has a hydroxyl on the C3 ring (C(O)), while in B, the hydroxyl is on the C2 ring (O in CCCC(O)C2). If the positions are different, they might not be the same. Also, the ester groups: in A, the ester is attached to the benzene ring via C(=O)OCC(C), whereas in B, it's part of a COC(...)=O group connected to a different part of the structure. The benzene substituents: in A, the methoxy is COc1..., and the ester is on the same benzene. In B, the benzene (c2cc(ccc2)OC) has methoxy (OC) and is part of the ester. So perhaps the substituents are in different positions. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is written such that the benzene in B is part of the ester group, which is attached to the main structure. The key difference might be the connectivity of the ester group and the bicyclic system. If the ester is attached to different positions or different parts of the molecule, they are different. Given that the SMILES strings are quite different in their notation, especially the ring closures and substituent placements, I'm leaning towards them being different molecules. However, without a tool, it's hard to be 100% sure, but based on the analysis, the answer is likely No.",

Hmm, first I should parse each SMILES to see their structures.\n\nStarting with Molecule A. The main part seems to be a benzene ring (the 'c1cc...c1' part) with substituents. The benzene ring has three methoxy groups (OC), one of which is connected to a chain. Let me break it down: COc1 means a methoxy group attached to position 1 of the benzene ring. Then there's a CC group attached to another ring. The part after Cc2cnc(N)nc2N is a pyrimidine ring? Because c2cnc(N)nc2N \u2013 that's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. Wait, the SMILES here: c2cnc(N)nc2N. So positions 2 and 4 have nitrogens. The substituents on the pyrimidine are an amino group (N) and another amino (N) at position 4? Then, the benzene ring (from the first part) has another OC group and then OCC... which is a methoxyethyl group? Wait, the end part is OCc1ccc(C)cc1, which is a methoxy group connected to a benzene ring with a methyl group. So maybe the structure is a central benzene with three methoxy groups, one of which is attached to a CH2 group connected to a pyrimidine ring (with two amino groups), and another methoxy connected to a benzene ring that has a methyl group.\n\nNow, Molecule B: c1(c(cc(cc1OC)Cc1c(N)nc(nc1)N)OC)OCc1ccc(cc1)C. Let me parse this. The first part is a benzene ring again. Let's see, the SMILES starts with c1(...), which is a benzene ring. The substituents here are a bit complex. The first substituent is at position 1: c(...), which might be another ring? Wait, the SMILES is c1(c(...)OC)... So the benzene ring has a substituent at position 1 which is a group that includes another ring. Let me try to map the parentheses. The structure is c1(c(cc(cc1OC)... Hmm, maybe the central benzene has substituents at positions 1, 3, and 4? Alternatively, perhaps the main benzene has a substituent that's a connected structure. The part after the first c1 is (c(cc(cc1OC)Cc1c(N)nc(nc1)N)OC). Breaking that down: inside the first parentheses, there's another c(...), which might be a benzene ring. The substituents here are OC (methoxy), and a CC group connected to another ring. The CC connects to c1c(N)nc(nc1)N. That's a pyrimidine again, similar to Molecule A. The pyrimidine here has two amino groups as well. Then, after that part, there's an OC group, which would be another methoxy substituent on the main benzene. The rest is OCc1ccc(cc1)C, which is the same as in Molecule A: a methoxy connected to a benzene with a methyl group.\n\nWait, but the arrangement of substituents on the main benzene ring might be different. In Molecule A, the main benzene has substituents at positions 1, 3, 4, maybe? Let me try to draw both structures mentally.\n\nMolecule A's main benzene: COc1cc(...)cc(OC)c1OC... So position 1 is OCH3 (methoxy), position 3 is the Cc2... group, position 4 is another OCH3, and position 5 is OCH2...? Wait, SMILES notation can sometimes be tricky with the ordering. Let me re-express the SMILES for A:\n\nCOc1cc(Cc2cnc(N)nc2N)cc(OC)c1OCc1ccc(C)cc1.\n\nBreaking it down: The benzene ring is 'c1cc...cc...c1'. The first 'c1' starts with OCH3 (COc1). Then comes two carbons (cc), followed by a substituent (Cc2...), then another two carbons (cc), then OC (another methoxy), followed by the closing c1. Then there's OCc1ccc(C)cc1, which is OCH2 connected to a benzene ring with a methyl group.\n\nSo the main benzene ring in A has substituents at positions 1 (OCH3), 3 (CH2-pyrimidine), 4 (OCH3), and the OCH2-benzene-methyl group at position 5? Or maybe the substituents are at positions 2,4,5? Wait, SMILES notation can sometimes be confusing because the numbering depends on where you start. Let me try to parse the main ring step by step.\n\nThe main benzene in A: COc1cc(...)cc(OC)c1... So the SMILES starts with CO (methoxy) attached to the first carbon (position 1) of the benzene. Then comes two carbons (positions 2 and 3?), then the substituent at position 4: Cc2... (a CH2 group connected to the pyrimidine ring). Then two more carbons (positions 5 and 6?), followed by a methoxy (OC) at position 6? Wait, the structure is COc1cc(Cc2...)cc(OC)c1... So after the initial COc1, the sequence is c c (substituent) c c (OC) c1. So the benzene ring has six carbons: positions 1 (OCH3), then positions 2 and 3 (each with a carbon), position 4 has the CH2-pyrimidine substituent, positions 5 and 6 have carbons, position 6 has another OCH3. Then the c1 ends the ring. Then there's OCc1... which is another OCH2 connected to a benzene with a methyl.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to consider that in SMILES notation, the order of the atoms in the ring determines their positions. For example, COc1cc(Cc2...)cc(OC)c1... The ring closure is at the end with c1. So the benzene ring is written as OCH3 (position 1), then positions 2 and 3 are carbons, position 4 has the substituent Cc2..., positions 5 and 6 are carbons with OCH3 at position 5 or 6? The 'cc(OC)' part after the substituent would be positions 5 and 6. The OC (methoxy) is attached to position 5, and position 6 is the next carbon. Then the ring closes at c1. So the substituents on the main benzene are OCH3 (position 1), CH2-pyrimidine (position 4), OCH3 (position 5), and then after the ring closure, there's another OCH2-benzene-methyl group. Wait, but that last part (OCc1ccc(C)cc1) is connected where? The entire main benzene is closed at the first c1. Then the OCc1... is a separate group attached where? Oh, I think I might have made a mistake. The SMILES for Molecule A is COc1cc(Cc2...)cc(OC)c1OCc1ccc(C)cc1. So after the main benzene ring (c1...c1), there's OCc1... which is a methoxy (OCH2-) connected to another benzene ring (c1ccc(C)cc1) with a methyl group. So the main benzene has substituents: OCH3 at position 1, the CH2-pyrimidine group at position 4, OCH3 at position 5, and then OCH2 connected to another benzene (with methyl) at position... where? Wait, the main benzene ring is written as COc1cc(...)cc(OC)c1OC... So the 'OCc1...' is attached to which position? Because after the main benzene closes (c1), the next part is OCC... So that would be a substituent attached to the main benzene ring. Wait, no. The SMILES is COc1cc(Cc2...)cc(OC)c1OCc1ccc(C)cc1. So after the main benzene (c1), the 'OCc1...' is a separate part. Wait, that can't be. Because the main benzene is already closed with c1. So perhaps the OCH2-benzene-methyl is attached to the main benzene. So the main benzene has four substituents: OCH3 at position 1, CH2-pyrimidine at position 4, OCH3 at position 5, and OCH2-benzene-methyl at another position. Wait, but benzene only has six positions. If the main ring is written as COc1cc(...)cc(OC)c1OC..., then the substituents are at positions 1, 4, 5, and maybe position 6? Because the main ring is: 1 (OCH3), then positions 2, 3, 4 (CH2...), 5, 6 (OCH3), and then the OCH2... is attached where? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to imagine the main benzene. The SMILES starts with COc1, so position 1 has OCH3. Then the next two c's are positions 2 and 3. Then the substituent at position 4 (CH2...). Then two more c's (positions 5 and 6), but then there's cc(OC), so position 5 is a carbon, and position 6 has OCH3. Then the ring closes at c1. Then comes OCc1..., which would be another substituent attached to the main benzene? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the main benzene is already closed. Oh wait, maybe the OCc1... is part of the main benzene's substituents. Let me think again. The entire SMILES for A is: COc1cc(Cc2cnc(N)nc2N)cc(OC)c1OCc1ccc(C)cc1. So after the main benzene ring (which is closed at c1), the OCc1... is a substituent attached to the benzene. But how? Because the main benzene's substituents are already defined within the ring notation. Wait, perhaps the OCH2-benzene-methyl is a substituent on the main benzene. Let me try to parse the entire SMILES again step by step.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- COc1: Methoxy (OCH3) attached to position 1 of a benzene ring (c1).\n- cc(Cc2...): Positions 2 and 3 are carbons, then position 4 has a substituent which is CH2 connected to another ring (c2...).\n- The c2 part: c2cnc(N)nc2N. That's a six-membered ring (c2...c2) with two nitrogens. The sequence is c2 c n c(N) n c2 N. So positions 2 and 4 of this ring are nitrogens. The substituents are N (amino) at position 5 and another N (amino) at position 6? Or maybe positions 3 and 5? I'm getting a bit confused here. Anyway, it's a diaminopyrimidine ring attached via CH2 to the main benzene.\n- Back to the main benzene: after the substituent at position 4, we have cc(OC) which would be positions 5 and 6. Position 5 is a carbon, position 6 has OCH3 (methoxy).\n- Then the main benzene closes with c1. Then comes OCc1ccc(C)cc1: OCH2 connected to another benzene ring (c1ccc(C)cc1) which has a methyl group (C) at position 4. So where is this OCH2-benzene-methyl group attached to the main benzene? Since the main benzene is already closed with c1, the OCc1... must be a substituent on the main benzene. But how? Because the main benzene's substituents are already specified within the ring notation. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the SMILES. Let me check the SMILES syntax again. \n\nIn SMILES, branches are represented with parentheses. So if after the main benzene (c1...c1), there's a OCH2..., that would mean that the OCH2... is attached to the last atom of the main benzene, which is the c1 (position 1). But that can't be, because position 1 already has a methoxy group (COc1). Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the OCc1... is a separate part connected via a bond. Wait, maybe the main benzene has a substituent which is OCH2 connected to another benzene. But where is that substituent located on the main benzene?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main benzene has substituents at positions 1 (OCH3), 4 (CH2-pyrimidine), 5 (OCH3), and another substituent at position 3 (the OCH2-benzene-methyl). But that depends on the SMILES structure. Let me try to number the main benzene:\n\nCOc1cc(Cc2...)cc(OC)c1OCc1...\n\nThe main benzene is written as:\n\nCOc1 - position 1: OCH3\nc (position 2)\nc (position 3) [with substituent Cc2...]\n(Cc2...) - substituent at position 3\nc (position 4)\nc (position 5) [with substituent OC (OCH3)]\nc1 - position 6 (closing the ring)\nThen OCc1... - this would be a new substituent. But wait, the main ring is already closed. So perhaps the OCc1... is connected to position 6 of the main benzene. Because after closing the ring (c1), any following atoms are connected to the last atom in the ring. So the last atom in the main ring is position 6 (which was the c1). So position 6 has OCH3 from the cc(OC)c1 part, and then another OCH2-benzene-methyl attached to it? But that would mean position 6 has two substituents: OCH3 and OCH2-benzene-methyl. But benzene carbons can't have more than one substituent unless they are part of a branched structure. Wait, but in SMILES, if you have something like c1ccc(OCC)cc1, that's a benzene with a substituent. But if you have c1ccc(OC)cc1OCC..., that would imply two substituents on the same carbon. Which isn't possible. So maybe I made a mistake in parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the OCc1... is attached to the oxygen of the OCH3 at position 6. But that would create a different structure. For example, OCH2- instead of OCH3. Wait, no. The OCH3 is a methoxy group (O-C-CH3). If after that, there's an OC..., that would be O connected to another carbon. Wait, but the SMILES is COc1cc(...)cc(OC)c1OCc1.... So after the main benzene closes (c1), there's OCc1..., which would be O-C- followed by a benzene ring. So this would be an oxygen connected to a CH2 group which is connected to another benzene. But where is this oxygen attached? It would have to be attached to one of the carbons in the main benzene. But the main benzene has already been closed with c1. So the OCc1... must be a substituent on the main benzene. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the main benzene's SMILES is written as COc1cc(Cc2...)cc(OC)c1OCc1..., which implies that after the main benzene (positions 1-6), there's an OCH2 group attached to one of the carbons. But which one? The last atom in the main benzene is position 6 (from c1). So the OCc1... would be attached to position 6. But position 6 already has a methoxy group (OC) from the cc(OC)c1 part. That would mean position 6 has two substituents: OCH3 and OCH2-benzene-methyl. That's not possible for a benzene ring. So this suggests that there's an error in my parsing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the OCc1... is part of a branch. Let me look at the parentheses. The main SMILES for A is: COc1cc(Cc2cnc(N)nc2N)cc(OC)c1OCc1ccc(C)cc1. The part after the main benzene is OCc1..., which is not within any parentheses. So perhaps the OCH2-benzene-methyl is connected to the oxygen of the methoxy group at position 6. Wait, that would make the structure O-CH2-benzene-methyl attached to the O of the OCH3, making it O(CH3)(CH2-benzene-methyl). But oxygen can only form two bonds. So that's impossible. Therefore, this suggests that my initial parsing is incorrect.\n\nI must be making a mistake in the SMILES interpretation. Let me try to use a different approach. Perhaps the entire structure is a benzene ring with three substituents: two methoxy groups and a CH2-pyrimidine group, plus another substituent which is OCH2-benzene-methyl. But where?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is structured such that the main benzene has substituents at positions 1, 3, 4, and 5. Wait, but benzene can't have four substituents in this context unless some are part of branches. Wait, no, benzene can have multiple substituents. Let me try to draw this mentally again.\n\nMolecule A's SMILES: COc1cc(Cc2...)cc(OC)c1OCc1ccc(C)cc1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is COc1cc(Cc2...)cc(OC)c1: this is a benzene ring with substituents. The starting group is CO (OCH3) at position 1. Then positions 2 and 3 are carbons. Position 4 has the substituent Cc2... (CH2 connected to a pyrimidine). Then positions 5 and 6 have a methoxy (OC) at position 5, and position 6 is a carbon. Then the ring closes. After that, we have OCc1... which is OCH2 connected to another benzene ring with a methyl group. But where is this OCH2 group attached? It must be attached to one of the existing atoms in the main benzene. Since the main benzene is already closed, the OCH2... is attached to the last atom of the main benzene, which is position 6. But position 6 already has a hydrogen (since it's a benzene carbon). But if you add OCH2..., that would make position 6 have two substituents: the original hydrogen (now replaced by OCH2...) and the methoxy at position 5? No, wait, position 5 has the methoxy (OC) group. Position 6 is part of the benzene ring. So attaching OCH2... to position 6 would mean position 6 has two substituents: the OCH3 from position 5 (no, position 5 is adjacent to position 6?), wait, I'm getting more confused.\n\nMaybe it's better to use a tool to convert the SMILES to a structure, but since I can't do that, I have to proceed mentally. Let me consider that both molecules A and B have the same substituents but arranged differently on the benzene ring. The key is whether the arrangement is the same or different, considering that SMILES can represent the same molecule with different atom orders.\n\nFor example, two SMILES can be different strings but represent the same molecule if the rings are numbered differently or if branches are written in a different order. So the question is: are these two SMILES strings canonicalized differently but representing the same structure?\n\nLooking at Molecule B's SMILES: c1(c(cc(cc1OC)Cc1c(N)nc(nc1)N)OC)OCc1ccc(cc1)C.\n\nParsing this:\n\n- The main benzene ring starts with c1(...). The substituents are in the parentheses. The first substituent is at position 1: c(...)OC). Inside that substituent, there's another benzene ring? Let's see: c(cc(cc1OC)...). Wait, maybe the main benzene has a substituent that's a benzene ring with its own substituents. Alternatively, this could be a fused ring or a substituent with a complex structure.\n\nAlternatively, the main benzene (c1) has a substituent at position 1 which is a group that includes another benzene ring. Let me break it down:\n\nc1( substituent )OC)OCc1...\n\nThe substituent at position 1 is c(cc(cc1OC)Cc1c(N)nc(nc1)N)OC). Hmm, this is complex. Let's see:\n\nInside the substituent at position 1 of the main benzene:\n\n- There's a benzene ring (starting with c(...)), which has substituents. Let's parse this inner benzene:\n\nc(cc(cc1OC)Cc1c(N)nc(nc1)N)OC)\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- The inner benzene is written as c(...), with substituents. The sequence is cc(cc1OC), which might refer to positions 2, 3, etc. Wait, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps the main difference between A and B is the arrangement of substituents on the benzene rings. If the substituents are the same but their positions are different, then the molecules are different. If the substituents are the same and their positions are the same (considering rotational symmetry), then they are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are just different representations of the same molecule due to different ring numbering or branch order. For example, the order in which substituents are listed in the SMILES can vary, but the actual structure is the same.\n\nAnother approach: check if the two SMILES have the same substituents and connectivity, regardless of the order written.\n\nMolecule A has:\n\n- A benzene ring with:\n  - OCH3\n  - CH2 connected to a pyrimidine (with two amino groups)\n  - OCH3\n  - OCH2 connected to another benzene with a methyl group.\n\nMolecule B seems to have the same substituents but perhaps arranged differently on the main benzene. For example, the OCH3 groups and the CH2-pyrimidine might be in different positions.\n\nAlternatively, if the main benzene in B has the substituents in a different order but the overall structure is the same due to symmetry, then they could be the same molecule.\n\nBut without visualizing, it's hard to tell. Let me compare the substituents:\n\nBoth have:\n\n- Three OCH3 groups? Wait, in A: COc1..., then another OC in the main benzene (cc(OC)), and then OCc1... which is OCH2 connected to another benzene. So the main benzene has two OCH3 groups and one OCH2-benzene-methyl. Wait, no: COc1 is OCH3, then cc(OC) is another OCH3, and then after the ring closure, there's OCc1..., which is OCH2... So the main benzene in A has two OCH3 groups and one OCH2... substituent. Then the CH2-pyrimidine group. So total substituents: OCH3 (position 1), CH2-pyrimidine (position 4), OCH3 (position 5), and OCH2-benzene-methyl (position 6).\n\nIn Molecule B, the main benzene's substituents might be arranged differently. Let's parse B again:\n\nB's SMILES: c1(c(cc(cc1OC)Cc1c(N)nc(nc1)N)OC)OCc1ccc(cc1)C.\n\nThe main benzene (c1) has substituents:\n\n- At position 1: a complex group (c(...)OC)\n- At another position: OC (methoxy)\n- At another position: OCc1ccc(cc1)C (OCH2-benzene-methyl)\n\nThe complex substituent at position 1 in B is c(cc(cc1OC)Cc1c(N)nc(nc1)N)OC). Let's break this down:\n\n- The inner part starts with c(...), which is another benzene ring. The substituents on this inner benzene are:\n\n  - cc(cc1OC): positions 2 and 3 have carbons, then positions 4 and 5 have a connection to the main benzene (cc1OC refers back to the main benzene's position 1 with an OCH3? Wait, this is getting too confusing. Alternatively, this might be a fused ring or a branching point.\n\nAlternatively, the substituent at position 1 of the main benzene in B is a benzene ring with its own substituents: OCH3, CH2-pyrimidine, and another OCH3. If that's the case, then the structure might be similar to A but with the substituents arranged differently.\n\nIf the main benzene in B has substituents arranged in a different order but the same overall connectivity, they could be the same molecule. For example, if the main benzene in A has substituents at positions 1, 4, 5, and 6, and in B they are at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6, but due to symmetry, the molecule is the same.\n\nAlternatively, if the positions are different and not symmetrically equivalent, the molecules are different.\n\nGiven the complexity of these SMILES strings, it's challenging to determine without a visual aid, but I'll try to reason through.\n\nBoth molecules have:\n\n- A main benzene ring with two methoxy groups, a CH2-pyrimidine group (with two amino groups), and an OCH2-benzene-methyl group.\n\nThe question is whether the relative positions of these substituents are the same in both molecules.\n\nIn SMILES, the order of writing doesn't necessarily reflect the positions on the ring. For example, the same molecule can be written with different starting points, leading to different SMILES strings. However, canonical SMILES would be identical, but non-canonical SMILES could vary.\n\nIf the two SMILES strings are different but represent the same connectivity, then the answer is Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nTo check this, I need to see if the substituents are in equivalent positions considering the benzene ring's symmetry.\n\nFor example, if in A, the substituents are at positions 1, 3, 4, and 5, and in B they are at positions 1, 2, 4, and 6, but due to ring symmetry (like para or meta positions), they might be the same.\n\nAlternatively, if the substituents are in positions that are not symmetrically equivalent, the molecules are different.\n\nGiven the complexity, I might need to assume that the SMILES strings are different because the arrangement of substituents is different. For example, in A, the OCH2-benzene-methyl is attached at a different position than in B.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to count the number of each substituent. Both have two methoxy groups (OCH3), one CH2-pyrimidine-amino group, and one OCH2-benzene-methyl. So the same substituents. Now, their positions on the main benzene need to be the same or symmetrically equivalent.\n\nAssuming that the main benzene in A has substituents at positions 1, 4, 5, and 6 (OCH3 at 1 and 5, CH2-pyrimidine at 4, and OCH2... at 6), and in B, they are at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6, then depending on the symmetry, they might be different. For example, if the substituents are adjacent or opposite, the molecule's structure changes.\n\nBut without knowing the exact positions, it's hard. However, given that the SMILES strings are different and not canonical, they might represent the same molecule if the substituents are in equivalent positions. But since the user hasn't provided canonical SMILES, it's possible they are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are different but isomorphic. To confirm that, I'd need to check if the connectivity is the same. For example, in A, the OCH2-benzene-methyl is attached to the main benzene at a different position than in B.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the two SMILES strings represent different molecules because the arrangement of substituents on the main benzene ring differs. The order in which the substituents are attached in the SMILES suggests different positions, leading to different structures.",

I need to compare the two SMILES structures to see if they represent the same molecule.\n\nFirst, I'll write down both SMILES to visualize them better. Molecule A is Nc1ccnc(Nc2ccc(Oc3ccc(Cl)cc3)cc2)c1. Molecule B is c1nc(cc(c1)N)Nc1ccc(Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1.\n\nSMILES can sometimes look different due to different starting points or ring numbering, but they can still be the same molecule. Let me parse each SMILES step by step.\n\nStarting with Molecule A: The main structure seems to be a pyrimidine ring (since there's a cc nc pattern). The first part is N attached to position 1 of a ring. The ring has a nitrogen at position 3 (since ccnc...). Then there's another amino group (N) attached to that nitrogen, leading to a benzene ring substituted with an oxygen connected to another benzene ring with a chlorine.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES starts with a ring (c1nc...). The positions here might be different. Let's break it down. The first ring is c1nc(cc(c1)N)N... So, the ring has a nitrogen at position 2 (since the ring starts at c1, then n is next), and the substituents are a NH2 group (N) on the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen. Then there's another N attached, leading to the same benzene ring with the oxygen and chlorine substituent as in Molecule A.\n\nWait, the key is to see if the two SMILES strings are just different representations of the same structure. Since SMILES can start numbering from different atoms, especially in rings, the order of substituents might look different but actually be the same.\n\nLet me try to draw both structures mentally. Molecule A has a central pyrimidine-like ring (two nitrogens) with an amino group on one nitrogen and a benzene ring attached via another amino group. The benzene ring has an oxygen bridge to a chlorinated benzene.\n\nMolecule B's central ring: the first part is a six-membered ring? Let's see. The SMILES starts with c1nc(cc(c1)N)N... So the ring is positions 1-6: starting with carbon 1, then nitrogen at position 2, followed by a carbon connected to another carbon (cc) which has an NH2 (N). Then, the next part is N attached to that ring, leading to the same benzene-O-benzene-Cl structure.\n\nWait, maybe the central ring in both cases is a pyrimidine. In Molecule A, the ring is Nc1ccnc(...) which would be a six-membered ring with nitrogens at positions 1 and 3 (assuming numbering starts at the first N). So positions 1 (N), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (n), 5 (c), 6 (c). Then the substituents are NH2 at position 1 and the other substituent at position 4 (the n in the ring is connected to the N...).\n\nIn Molecule B, the central ring is c1nc(cc(c1)N)N... So the ring starts at carbon 1, then position 2 is nitrogen, then position 3 is a carbon connected to a substituent. Let me parse this:\n\nRing positions:\n1: c\n2: n\n3: c connected to (cc(c1)N) \u2013 wait, maybe the branching here is a bit confusing. The SMILES is c1nc(cc(c1)N)N... So the ring is c1 followed by n (position 2), then c (position 3) which branches into cc(c1)N. The cc part would be positions 4 and 5? Wait, maybe the ring is c1 (1), n (2), c (3) with a branch: cc(N) \u2013 that would be two carbons (positions 4 and 5?), and then back to the ring at position 6? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central ring in Molecule B is a pyrimidine as well. Let me try to outline both structures:\n\nMolecule A: The main ring is a pyrimidine (two nitrogens). The substituents are an NH2 group on one nitrogen and another NH group connected to a benzene ring (which is connected via an oxygen to a chlorobenzene).\n\nMolecule B: The main ring starts with a carbon, then a nitrogen, then another carbon with substituents. The substituents here are an NH2 group and another NH group leading to the same benzene-O-chlorobenzene structure.\n\nWait, maybe the central rings are the same but numbered differently. In SMILES, the numbering depends on where you start. For example, a benzene ring can be numbered starting at any carbon, so different SMILES might look different but represent the same molecule.\n\nLet me consider the canonical SMILES. If the two SMILES strings, when canonicalized, are the same, then they are the same molecule. However, without using a tool, I need to mentally compare them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference is in the positions of substituents on the central ring. Let's check:\n\nIn Molecule A: The main ring is Nc1ccnc(N...)c1. So the first nitrogen is at position 1. Then the ring has carbons at 2 and 3, a nitrogen at position 4 (the 'n' in 'ccn'), followed by carbons 5 and 6. So positions 1 (N), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (N), 5 (C), 6 (C), making a six-membered ring with nitrogens at 1 and 4. Then, substituents are NH2 at position 1 (since the first part is Nc1...) and another substituent at position 4 (the N is connected to the benzene ring).\n\nIn Molecule B: The main ring is c1nc(cc(c1)N)N... So starting at carbon 1 (c1), position 2 is nitrogen (n), position 3 is carbon (c) with a branch: cc(c1)N. Breaking that down: position 3 has a branch where there's two carbons (positions 4 and 5?), and the second carbon (position 5) has an NH2 group (N). Then back to the main ring at position 6. Then the main ring continues with another N substituent leading to the benzene-O-chlorobenzene group.\n\nWait, perhaps the central ring in Molecule B has nitrogens at positions 2 and 6? Let me try to map this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both molecules have the same substituents but arranged differently on the central ring. For example, in Molecule A, the NH2 is at position 1 and the other substituent at position 4. In Molecule B, the NH2 is at position 5 (from the branch) and the substituent at position 2. If the ring can be rotated, perhaps these positions are equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central ring in Molecule B is a pyrimidine but numbered starting from a different position. For example, if in Molecule A, the ring is numbered starting at the NH2 group (position 1), then the other substituent is at position 4. In Molecule B, if the ring is numbered starting at a different point, the substituents could end up at equivalent positions.\n\nAnother approach is to check the substituents. Both molecules have two substituents on their central ring: one is an NH2 group, and the other is an NH-(benzene-O-benzene-Cl) group. The positions of these substituents relative to each other on the ring will determine if the molecules are the same.\n\nIn a pyrimidine ring (six-membered with two nitrogens), the positions can be 1 and 3 (meta) or 1 and 4 (para). Wait, pyrimidine has nitrogens at positions 1 and 3. If the substituents are at positions 2 and 4, or 1 and 4, etc., depending on the ring.\n\nWait, maybe the central ring in both molecules is a pyrimidine (nitrogens at 1 and 3 positions). Then in Molecule A, substituents are at 1 (NH2) and 4 (the other group). In Molecule B, substituents would be at different positions, but perhaps due to ring numbering, they are the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central ring isn't a pyrimidine. Let's see. For Molecule A: Nc1ccnc(...)c1. Breaking that down: the ring starts with N, then c, c, n, c, c. So the ring has two nitrogens at positions 1 and 4. So that's a pyrimidine (positions 1 and 4 are nitrogens? Wait, pyrimidine has nitrogens at 1 and 3. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count: position 1 (N), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (n), 5 (c), 6 (c). So nitrogens at 1 and 4. That's a 1,4-diazine, which is not pyrimidine (pyrimidine is 1,3-diazine). So the central ring is a 1,4-diazine (like pyrazine? No, pyrazine is 1,4-diazine. Wait, pyridazine is 1,2, pyrimidine 1,3, pyrazine 1,4. So Molecule A's central ring is a pyrazine ring with two amino groups attached?\n\nWait, no. The substituents in Molecule A are N attached to position 1 (NH2), and another N attached to the ring's nitrogen at position 4? Wait, no. The SMILES is Nc1ccnc(N...)c1. The first N is attached to position 1 (c1). Then the ring has positions 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (n), which is part of the ring, then position 5 (c), 6 (c). So the ring has nitrogens at positions 1 and 4. So that's a pyrazine ring. Then, substituents are NH2 at position 1 (from Nc1...) and another substituent at position 4 (the n in the ring is connected to N...). Wait, but the ring's position 4 is a nitrogen, so substituents attached to that would be on the nitrogen. So in Molecule A, the pyrazine ring has an NH2 at position 1 (carbon) and another NH group (from Nc...) at position 4 (nitrogen). Wait, no. The SMILES is Nc1ccnc(N...)c1. The 'n' in the ring (position 4) is connected to a nitrogen via Nc... So the substituent on the nitrogen at position 4 is a benzene ring attached via an amino group (N). So the substituents are: at position 1 (carbon) NH2, and at position 4 (nitrogen) a NH-benzene-O... group.\n\nNow, looking at Molecule B: c1nc(cc(c1)N)N... The central ring starts with c1 (carbon 1), then n (nitrogen at position 2), c (carbon 3) with a branch: cc(c1)N. That branch is two carbons (positions 4 and 5?), with position 5 connected to NH2 (N). Then the main ring continues with another N substituent leading to the benzene-O-chlorobenzene.\n\nWait, the central ring in Molecule B: positions 1 (c), 2 (n), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (c), 6 (c), but with substituents. The branch at position 3 is cc(c1)N. So the branch starts at position 3 (c), then another c (position 4), then c connected back to c1 (position 1 of the main ring?), then N (NH2). Wait, maybe this is forming a fused ring or a substituent. Alternatively, the branch is a chain: position 3 has a substituent which is a two-carbon chain (c-c) ending in NH2. But that would make a substituent like CH2CH2NH2, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is written as c1nc(cc(c1)N)N..., meaning that after the n at position 2 and c at position 3, there's a substituent on position 3 which is a carbon chain: cc(c1)N. Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to parse the SMILES again.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES: c1nc(cc(c1)N)Nc1ccc(Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is c1, which starts a ring (let's say ring A).\n- Then comes n (nitrogen) at position 2 of ring A.\n- Then c (position 3) with a branch: (cc(c1)N). This branch starts at position 3. The 'cc(c1)N' part: the first c is position 4, the next c is position 5, which is connected back to c1 (the first atom of ring A), and then N (NH2 group) is attached to position 5. Wait, but that would form a five-membered ring? Because if position 5 is connected back to c1 (position 1 of ring A), then positions 1-5 form a ring. But ring A was initially started as c1, so the main ring is six-membered. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should draw it out step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central ring in Molecule B is a six-membered ring with a nitrogen at position 2 and another substituent. The branch at position 3 leads to a chain that connects back to position 1, creating a fused ring? No, that might not be the case. Alternatively, the branch is a substituent on position 3: a propyl group or something else. Wait, perhaps the 'cc(c1)N' part is a substituent on the central ring's position 3. Let's see: the central ring is positions 1 (c), 2 (n), 3 (c with a substituent), then positions 4,5,6. The substituent on position 3 is a chain: c connected to another c, which is connected back to c1 (position 1 of the central ring) and also to an NH2. That would form a five-membered ring? Because position 3's substituent connects to position 1. So that would make a ring of positions 1-3-4-5-1? But I'm not sure. Maybe this is a fused ring structure, but I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is written in a way that the substituent on position 3 is a -CH2CH(NH2)- group, but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider that the central ring in Molecule B is a six-membered ring with a nitrogen at position 2 and another substituent. The substituent on position 3 is a -CH2CH2NH2 group? But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is structured such that the central ring has a substituent at position 3 that is a carbon connected to another carbon, which is connected to the NH2 group. But then how does the (c1) part fit in? The 'cc(c1)' part suggests that the second carbon in the substituent is connected back to the first atom of the main ring (c1), forming a ring. So, the substituent on position 3 is a two-carbon chain that connects back to position 1, creating a five-membered ring. So, the main ring (positions 1-6) and a fused five-membered ring. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nThis is getting a bit too confusing to visualize mentally. Maybe a better approach is to look for the substituents. Both molecules have two amino groups (NH2 and NH-) attached to the central ring and the same benzene-O-chlorobenzene group.\n\nIf the central rings in both molecules are six-membered with two nitrogens, and the substituents are in positions that are equivalent when the ring is rotated or numbered differently, then the molecules are the same. Otherwise, they are different.\n\nAnother approach: check if the SMILES strings are different due to ring numbering but represent the same structure. For example, in Molecule A, the central ring is Nc1ccnc(...)c1. In Molecule B, the central ring is c1nc(...)cc(c1)... If the ring is numbered in the opposite direction, the substituents might appear in different positions but are actually the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central ring in both is a pyrazine (1,4-diazine) with substituents at positions 2 and 5 (if numbered differently). Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's try to assign numbers.\n\nIn Molecule A: The central ring is N-c1-c2-c3-n4-c5-c6 (with c1 connected to c6). The substituents are NH2 on c1 and the other substituent on n4. Wait, but nitrogens in the ring can't have substituents unless they're part of the ring. Wait, no. The 'n' in the ring is part of the ring, so the substituent on n4 would be attached to that nitrogen. But in SMILES, the order matters. For example, Nc1ccnc(...)c1: the first N is attached to c1. The 'n' in the ring (n4) is connected to the N from the substituent (Nc2ccc...).\n\nWait, let me parse Molecule A again:\n\nMolecule A: Nc1ccnc(Nc2ccc(Oc3ccc(Cl)cc3)cc2)c1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first atom is N (NH2 group) attached to c1, which is part of a ring (c1ccnc...c1).\n- The ring is c1 connected to c2, c3, n4, c5, c6, back to c1.\n- So the ring is c1 (with NH2), c2, c3, n4 (connected to Nc2...), c5, c6.\n- The n4 is part of the ring and has a substituent Nc2... which is an amino group connected to a benzene ring (c2ccc...), which is substituted with an O connected to another benzene ring (c3ccc(Cl)cc3).\n\nIn Molecule B: c1nc(cc(c1)N)Nc1ccc(Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Starts with c1, part of a ring.\n- Next is n (nitrogen) at position 2 of the ring.\n- Then c3 with a branch: (cc(c1)N).\n  - The branch starts at c3: c connected to another c (c4), which is connected back to c1 (forming a five-membered ring?), and also has an N (NH2) attached.\n- Then, after the branch, there's another N (connected to the benzene ring as before).\n\nThis is quite complex. If the central ring in Molecule B is a five-membered ring due to the branch connecting back to c1, that would make it different from Molecule A's six-membered ring. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the branch is a substituent that doesn't form a ring, then the central ring is six-membered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for Molecule B is a different way of writing the same structure as Molecule A. For example, if the central ring in B is a six-membered ring with nitrogens at positions 2 and 5, and substituents at positions 2 and 6, which could be equivalent to positions 1 and 4 in Molecule A when the ring is flipped.\n\nAnother approach: count the number of atoms and bonds. Both molecules should have the same molecular formula if they are the same. Let's check:\n\nMolecule A: The central ring is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. The substituents are two NH groups (but wait, in Molecule A, the first substituent is NH2 (N attached to c1), and the other is an NH group connected to a benzene-O-benzene-Cl. The benzene-O-benzene-Cl part is the same in both molecules.\n\nSo, the molecular formula would depend on the central ring and substituents. Let's count:\n\nCentral ring in A: C4N2 (since it's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens and four carbons). The substituents: NH2 (adds N and 2H), and the other substituent is NH connected to a benzene ring (C6H4) connected to O connected to another benzene ring with Cl (C6H3ClO). Wait, the substituent from the N in the ring is NH-C6H4-O-C6H3Cl.\n\nIn total, the molecular formula would be:\n\nCentral ring (C4N2) + NH2 (N) + NH-C6H4-O-C6H3Cl + the hydrogens.\n\nSimilarly for Molecule B. If the central ring has the same number of carbons and nitrogens, and the substituents are the same, the molecular formulas would match. Assuming that's the case, then they could be the same molecule.\n\nBut without a tool, it's hard to be certain. However, given that the substituents (NH2 and the benzene-O-chlorobenzene group) are present in both, the key is whether their positions on the central ring are equivalent.\n\nGiven that SMILES can have different numbering but represent the same structure, it's possible that these are the same. For example, if the central ring is symmetric enough, the substituents could be in equivalent positions when the ring is rotated.\n\nAlternatively, if the central ring in A has substituents at positions 1 and 4, and in B at positions 2 and 5 (which would be equivalent in a six-membered ring with two nitrogens opposite each other), then they could be the same.\n\nAssuming the central ring is a pyrazine (1,4-diazine), which is symmetric, then substituents at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent to positions 1 and 4 if the ring is rotated. Wait, pyrazine is a six-membered ring with nitrogens at 1 and 4 positions. If substituents are at positions 2 and 5, they would be adjacent to the nitrogens. But in this case, the substituents are on the nitrogens themselves? Or on carbons.\n\nWait, in Molecule A, the substituents are on a carbon (NH2 on c1) and on a nitrogen (the other substituent on n4). In Molecule B, the substituents are on a carbon (NH2 via the branch) and on a nitrogen (the other substituent). But if the central rings are different (pyrazine vs. another structure), then the molecules would be different.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time I have, I think the best approach is to recognize that SMILES can represent the same molecule with different numbering, especially in symmetric rings. The presence of the same substituent groups (NH2 and the complex benzene-O-chlorobenzene) in both suggests they could be the same. However, the exact positions on the central ring need to match.\n\nAnother way to check is to see if the SMILES strings can be canonicalized to the same string. Since I can't do that here, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the order of substituents. In Molecule A, the NH2 is on the first carbon of the central ring, and the other substituent is on the nitrogen at position 4. In Molecule B, the NH2 might be on a different position, and the substituent on a different nitrogen. If the central ring's nitrogens are in positions that allow for symmetry, then the molecules could be the same.\n\nWait, but in Molecule A, the substituent on the nitrogen (n4) is possible? Wait, in a pyrazine ring, the nitrogens are at positions 1 and 4. Each nitrogen has two adjacent carbons. If a substituent is attached to a nitrogen in the ring, like in Molecule A, then that's part of the ring structure. But SMILES represents ring nitrogens with their valence. For example, a nitrogen in a ring with two bonds would have a hydrogen unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, in SMILES, the valence is determined by the bonds. For example, a nitrogen in a ring with two single bonds would have a lone pair and possibly a hydrogen. But in Molecule A, the nitrogen at position 4 (n) is connected to the rest of the substituent (Nc2...), meaning it's bonded to that N. So the structure would be a pyrazine ring with one nitrogen having a substituent (the N-linked benzene) and the other ring nitrogen as part of the ring without a substituent. But wait, that's not possible because each nitrogen in the pyrazine ring is part of the ring's double bonds. Let me think again.\n\nPyrazine has two nitrogens opposite each other. Each nitrogen is part of two double bonds in the ring. So each nitrogen has two double bonds and one single bond to a carbon. In SMILES, if a nitrogen is part of a ring with double bonds, its valence is satisfied. Adding a substituent to a ring nitrogen would require it to have a single bond, which is possible if the ring's bonding allows it.\n\nBut in Molecule A, the nitrogen at position 4 (n) is connected to an N group (Nc2...), which suggests that this nitrogen has a single bond to that N. That would mean the nitrogen in the ring has three bonds: two in the ring (double bonds?) and one to the substituent. That would require the nitrogen to have a positive charge or some hydrogen, which might not be represented in the SMILES. This could indicate that the structure is not possible, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central ring isn't aromatic. But the SMILES uses lowercase 'n' and 'c', which usually denotes aromatic rings. So maybe the ring is aromatic, and the nitrogen is part of the aromatic system. Adding a substituent to an aromatic nitrogen would require it to be in a position that allows for that, such as pyridine-like nitrogens, which can have substituents.\n\nIn any case, the key is whether the two SMILES represent the same connectivity. Given the complexity, I think the two molecules are actually the same, just represented with different SMILES due to ring numbering. For example, starting the numbering from different points or branches can lead to different SMILES strings that are actually the same molecule.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely \"Yes\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Let me start by looking at both SMILES and see if I can parse them.\n\nMolecule A is CSc1nc2ccc3nc(NC(=O)c4ccco4)sc3c2s1. Let me break that down. The SMILES starts with CS, which is a methylthio group (CH3S-). Then there's a ring notation: c1nc2ccc3... So it's a cyclic structure. The numbering might be a bit tricky here. Let me try to sketch it out mentally.\n\nStarting with the sulfur (S) attached to the methyl group (C), the first ring (c1) has a nitrogen (n), then another ring (c2) with three carbons (ccc), then another nitrogen (n) connected to a carbonyl group (NC(=O)...). The carbonyl is attached to a benzene-like ring (c4ccco4), which is a cyclopentenone or something similar? Wait, c4ccco4 would be a five-membered ring with four carbons, one oxygen. Wait, that's a furan ring? Because c4ccco4 would be O in the ring. Let me check: c is a carbon, then c, c, o (oxygen), and back to the fourth position. So that's a furan ring with the oxygen in position 4. So NC(=O) attached to that furan.\n\nThen back to the main structure. The sc3c2s1 part. So the main ring (ring 1) is connected via sulfur (s1). The substituents and the rings might be forming a fused ring system. Let me try to imagine the structure. Maybe it's a bicyclic system with thiophene rings or something similar.\n\nNow Molecule B is n1c2c(sc1SC)c1c(cc2)nc(s1)NC(=O)c1ccco1. Let's parse this one. Starting with n1, which is a nitrogen in a ring. Then c2c(sc1SC) suggests a ring with a sulfur connected to SC (which is S-C, maybe the same methylthio group as in A). Then there's another ring c1c(cc2) which might be a fused ring. The nc(s1) part suggests a nitrogen connected to a sulfur in ring 1. Then the NC(=O) group attached to another furan (c1ccco1 again).\n\nWait, both have NC(=O) attached to a furan ring (c4ccco4 in A and c1ccco1 in B). So that part might be the same. The difference could be in the arrangement of the rings and substituents.\n\nLet me try to compare the core structures. In A, the main ring is a series of fused rings. Let me count the atoms. Starting with the first ring (c1), which is connected to S from the methylthio. Then n (nitrogen), c2, which has ccc, then another nitrogen. The arrangement seems like a bicyclic system with sulfur and nitrogen atoms.\n\nIn B, the structure starts with n1c2c(...). The first ring (n1) is connected to c2, which has a sulfur attached to SC (so S-C, which is the methylthio group, same as A). Then c1c(cc2) suggests a fused ring between positions 1 and 2. Then nc(s1) would be a nitrogen connected to a sulfur in ring 1. \n\nWait, maybe the core structures are similar but the numbering is different, leading to different SMILES strings. SMILES can vary depending on the starting point and the direction of traversal. So perhaps the two SMILES are actually the same molecule but written differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement of the rings is different. Let me try to see if the connectivity is the same. For example, in A, the sulfur (from SC) is attached to the first ring (c1), while in B, the SC is attached to the sulfur in the first ring (s1). Hmm, maybe not. Let me try to draw both structures step by step.\n\nFor Molecule A:\n\nC-S-c1n-c2c(cc3n-c(s3)-NC(=O)-c4ccc(o4))-c2s1\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's parse it again. The SMILES is CSc1nc2ccc3nc(NC(=O)c4ccco4)sc3c2s1.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- CSc1: CH3-S connected to atom 1 (a carbon in a ring).\n- nc2: atom 1 is connected to a nitrogen (n) which is part of another ring (c2).\n- ccc3: the c2 ring has three carbons (ccc) leading to another ring (c3).\n- nc(...): the nitrogen in ring 3 is connected to a carbonyl group via NC(=O), which is attached to a furan (c4ccco4).\n- sc3: sulfur connected to ring 3, which is part of the c2 ring.\n- c2s1: the c2 ring connects back to the original ring (s1).\n\nFor Molecule B: n1c2c(sc1SC)c1c(cc2)nc(s1)NC(=O)c1ccco1.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- n1: start with a nitrogen in ring 1.\n- c2c(...): atom 2 (carbon in ring 2) connected to sc1SC. So, sc1 would be sulfur in ring 1, connected to SC (S-C, which is the methylthio group).\n- Then c1c(cc2): atom 1 in ring 1 is connected to a carbon that is part of a ring (ring 1 again?) with cc2 (connecting back to ring 2).\n- nc(s1): nitrogen connected to a sulfur in ring 1.\n- NC(=O) attached to furan (c1ccco1).\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps the core structure is the same, just written in a different order. SMILES can be written in different ways depending on the starting atom and the direction. The key is to see if the connectivity is identical.\n\nAnother approach is to canonicalize both SMILES. Since SMILES can vary in representation but the same molecule should have the same canonical SMILES. If I could generate the canonical SMILES for both, then compare them.\n\nBut since I can't actually run a tool here, I need to reason it out. Let's check for isomorphic structures.\n\nLooking at the substituents: both have a methylthio group (SC in A, SC attached to S in B?), the NC(=O) attached to a furan. The rings need to have the same number of atoms and connectivity.\n\nIn A, the main rings might be a tricyclic system with sulfur and nitrogen atoms. In B, perhaps the same but the starting point is different. For example, in A, the starting atom is the carbon attached to S (from CSc1), while in B, the starting atom is a nitrogen (n1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rings are arranged differently. Let me count the atoms in each ring.\n\nIn A's SMILES: The first ring (c1) is part of a system that includes n, c2, then ccc3, etc. It's a bit hard to track, but perhaps it's a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring, with substituents.\n\nIn B's SMILES: The n1 is part of a ring. The sc1SC suggests a sulfur connected to SC (methylthio), then c2 and another ring. Maybe the same fused rings but starting from a different atom.\n\nAnother thing to check: the number of sulfur atoms. In A, there are three sulfurs: the S in C-S, and two s in the rings (s1 and s3?). Wait, in A's SMILES: CSc1nc2ccc3nc(...)sc3c2s1. The s1 is in the first ring, and sc3 implies another sulfur in ring 3? Or is sc3 part of the same ring?\n\nAlternatively, the main ring could have two sulfur atoms. Let me see: the SMILES ends with ...c2s1. So ring 1 (c1) is closed with s1. So the first ring is c1 connected to S (from C-S), then n, c2, etc., and closed with s1. Then ring 2 (c2) is connected via ccc3, and ring 3 is closed with sc3. So maybe three rings? Or fused rings.\n\nIn B's SMILES: the sulfur atoms are in sc1SC and nc(s1). So the S from SC (methylthio) is connected to the sulfur in ring 1 (s1). Wait, that would be S-S-C? That might not be likely. Wait, the SMILES for B is n1c2c(sc1SC)c1c(cc2)nc(s1)... So the sc1SC part: the 's' is part of ring 1 (s1), then connected to SC. So the S from s1 is connected to S-C (so S-S-C?), but that's a disulfide, which is possible but maybe unusual. However, the original molecule A has C-S-C (from CSc1), which is a thioether. If B has S-S-C, that would be a different structure. Wait, but in B's SMILES: sc1SC is s (from ring 1) connected to C-S-C? Wait, no. Let me parse that part again.\n\nIn B's SMILES: n1c2c(sc1SC)... So the sc1SC part: the 's' is part of ring 1 (s1?), then connected to C-S-C? Wait, the SMILES is sc1SC. So the 's' is connected to c1 (ring 1) and to S-C. So the 's' (sulfur) is connected to another S (from SC). So that would be a disulfide bond between two sulfurs: S-S-C. But in molecule A, the SC is attached directly to the carbon (C-S-C). So this suggests that in B, there's a disulfide, whereas in A, it's a thioether. If that's the case, then the molecules are different.\n\nWait, but wait. In Molecule A: CSc1... means a methyl group (C) connected to sulfur (S), which is connected to c1. So the structure is CH3-S-C1...\n\nIn Molecule B: sc1SC would mean a sulfur (s) connected to c1 and to S-C. So the 's' from the ring is connected to another sulfur (S), which is connected to a methyl group (C). So that's a -S-S-CH3 group. Whereas in A, it's a -S-CH3 group. If that's correct, then the two molecules are different because one has a disulfide and the other a thioether.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misparsing the SMILES. Let me check again. In Molecule B: the part is sc1SC. The 's' here is a sulfur atom. The 'c1' refers to the first ring closure (ring 1). The 'SC' is S followed by C. So the 's' (sulfur) is connected to c1 and to S-C. So the structure would be -S-c1 and -S-C (methyl). So the sulfur in the ring is connected to another sulfur which is connected to a methyl group. So that's a disulfide linkage: -S-S-CH3. But in Molecule A, the methyl is directly attached to sulfur: -S-CH3.\n\nIf that's the case, then the two molecules have different substituents: one has a methylsulfanyl group (SMe), and the other has a disulfide (SSMe). That would make them different molecules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the SMILES. Maybe the 'sc1SC' in B is parsed as s-c1-S-C. So the 's' is connected to c1 and to S-C. But that would mean a sulfur connected to another sulfur (S-C). So yes, that would form a disulfide.\n\nIn contrast, in A, it's C-S-c1, which is a thioether (single sulfur). So if B has a disulfide and A has a thioether, then they are different.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be \"No\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, I need to determine if Molecule A and Molecule B are the same based on their SMILES strings. Let's start by looking at each SMILES structure carefully.\n\nMolecule A: COc1cc2ncnc(N(C)c3ccc(F)c(Cl)c3)c2cc1OC\nBreaking this down, it starts with COc, which is a methoxy group attached to a benzene ring. The numbering here is important. The benzene ring (c1) has a second ring (c2) connected via adjacent positions. The second ring has an ncnc chain, which is a pyrimidine-like structure. The nitrogen in the middle is connected to an N(C) group, which is a methyl-substituted amine. That amine is attached to another benzene ring (c3) that has fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl) substituents. Then, the original benzene ring (c1) has another methoxy group (OC) at the end.\n\nMolecule B: Clc1c(F)ccc(c1)N(c1ncnc2cc(OC)c(cc12)OC)C\nThis one starts with Cl attached to a benzene ring (c1), which also has F. Then there's a chain ccc leading to a connection to an N(C) group. The nitrogen here is part of a ring as well, connected to a c1ncnc2 structure. The c2 part has two methoxy groups (OC) attached. The ring structure here might be a fused ring system similar to Molecule A.\n\nComparing both, the key is to see if the connectivity and substituents are the same. Both have methoxy groups, fluorine, chlorine, and a methyl-substituted amine. The main difference might be in how the rings are connected. In Molecule A, the pyrimidine ring (ncnc) is part of a fused system with the benzene rings. In Molecule B, the Cl and F are on a benzene ring connected via the amine to another fused ring system with the pyrimidine. The order of substitution on the benzene rings and the positions of the substituents need to be checked.\n\nWait, SMILES strings can sometimes represent the same molecule with different ordering due to the starting point or ring numbering. Let me try to parse both structures again. Let's draw them mentally. \n\nMolecule A: The core is a benzene ring (positions 1-6) with methoxy groups at positions 1 and 6 (COc1...cc1OC). Then, at position 2 (since it's cc2), there's a fused ring (probably a five-membered ring with two nitrogens, ncnc). The N(C) group is attached to this ring, leading to another benzene ring with F and Cl. \n\nMolecule B: Starts with Cl attached to a benzene ring (c1), which also has F. The benzene is connected via a carbon (from ccc) to the N(C) group. The nitrogen is connected to a ring (c1ncnc2), which is a five-membered ring (ncnc implies alternating nitrogens and carbons). The c2 part has methoxy groups. \n\nWait, perhaps they are the same molecule but written with different starting points. For example, if the benzene ring with Cl and F is connected via the amine to the fused ring system, and the other parts are methoxy-substituted rings. If the connectivity is the same but the SMILES strings are written starting from different atoms, the molecules could be identical. \n\nAnother approach is to convert both SMILES to their canonical forms using a tool like RDKit. Since I can't do that here, I need to analyze manually. Let's see:\n\nIn Molecule A, the N(C) is attached to the pyrimidine ring (ncnc), which is fused to the benzene with two methoxy groups. Then, that N(C) is connected to a benzene ring with F and Cl. \n\nIn Molecule B, the Cl and F are on a benzene ring connected via a carbon chain (ccc) to the N(C), which is attached to a pyrimidine ring fused to another benzene with two methoxy groups. \n\nWait, maybe the difference is in the positions of F and Cl. In Molecule A, the benzene attached to the amine has c3ccc(F)c(Cl)c3, meaning the F is in the para position to Cl? Or is it meta? Let's parse c3ccc(F)c(Cl)c3: The benzene ring (c3) has substituents. The order is c3 (position 1), then three carbons (ccc) leading to position 4 (F), position 5 (Cl). So positions 4 and 5 are adjacent? Wait, SMILES notation builds the ring. Let's see: c3 is the first carbon. Then comes ccc(F), so positions 2, 3, 4, then c(Cl) would be position 5, and back to c3 (position 6). So F is at position 4, Cl at position 5. So they are adjacent on the benzene ring. \n\nIn Molecule B, the benzene is Clc1c(F)ccc(c1). So the first carbon (position 1) has Cl, position 2 has F, then positions 3,4,5,6 (ccc), making F at position 2 and Cl at position 1. So they are adjacent in Molecule B as well. Then, the benzene ring connected to the amine in both cases has Cl and F adjacent. \n\nThen, the rest of the structure: in A, the amine is connected to the pyrimidine ring, which is fused to the dimethoxy benzene. In B, the amine is connected to the pyrimidine ring which is part of a fused system with the dimethoxy benzene. \n\nWait, perhaps the core structures are the same. The pyrimidine ring (ncnc) is part of a fused bicyclic system with the benzene. If the methoxy groups are in equivalent positions, and the substituents (Cl, F) are in equivalent positions on their benzene rings, then they could be the same molecule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES strings are different representations of the same structure due to different starting points. For example, the order of substituents might vary but the actual connectivity is the same. \n\nIf I imagine that both molecules consist of a central pyrimidine ring fused to a benzene with two methoxy groups, and an amine-linked benzene with adjacent Cl and F, then they could be the same. The SMILES strings are just written in different orders, perhaps starting from different atoms. \n\nTherefore, despite the different SMILES strings, they represent the same molecule. So the answer should be Yes.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Let me start by looking at both structures carefully.\n\nMolecule A is CC(Nc1cccc(CN2CCOC2=O)c1)C(=O)NC(N)=O. Let me parse that. The main chain seems to start with a methyl group (CC...). Then there's an amine group (N) attached to a benzene ring. The benzene ring (c1cccc...) has a substituent at position 4 (assuming the numbering starts where the N is attached). The substituent is CN2CCOC2=O. That part looks like a cyclopropane ring? Wait, no, the SMILES notation for the ring here is N2CCOC2=O. So, the ring is a four-membered ring: N connected to C, then another C, O, and back to the first C with a ketone (O). Wait, let me draw this. The ring would be N-C-C-O connected back to the N, but the ketone is on the C adjacent to the O. So that's a morpholine ring with a ketone? Hmm, maybe a morpholinone ring? Because morpholine is a six-membered ring, but this is a four-membered ring. Wait, the ring is N-C-C-O-C=O? No, the SMILES is N2CCOC2=O. So the ring is N connected to C, then another C, then O, then C(=O), and back to the N. That makes a five-membered ring? Wait, no. Let's count the atoms. The ring is formed by the atoms N2, C, C, O, and C=O. So that's a five-membered ring? Wait, the ring closing is between the O and the N2. Wait, the notation is N2CCOC2=O. So the ring starts at N2, then C, C, O, then back to C2 (which is the same as N2?), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me break it down. The ring is written as N2CCOC2=O. So the atoms in the ring are N2, C, C, O, and then the ring closure is to C2. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, the numbers in the ring closures refer to the position in the SMILES string. So, the first atom is N2, then C, C, O, then another C which is connected back to the N2 (since it's C2). So the ring would be N2 connected to the first C, then another C, then O, then a C that's connected back to N2. That would form a four-membered ring: N-C-O-C (connected back to N). But then the C=O is on the C that's part of the ring. So the structure would be a four-membered ring: N-C-O-C(=O), but the ring is four atoms? Wait, N-C-O-C(=O) connected back to N would make a five-membered ring, but that's not possible here. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the SMILES notation. Let me try to write it step by step.\n\nStarting with the part CN2CCOC2=O:\n\n- The C is connected to N2.\n- Then comes C (so a carbon attached to N2)\n- Then another C (so a chain of C-C)\n- Then O (oxygen attached to the previous C)\n- Then C2=O. Here, C2 refers back to the second atom in the SMILES string, which is the N2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, in SMILES notation, the ring closure numbers refer to the order in the string. So the first occurrence of a number (like 2) is a ring closure to the next occurrence of 2. So, in the sequence N2CCOC2=O, the N is labeled as ring closure 2, then after the O, the C2=O refers back to the N. Wait, no. Let me parse it again:\n\nThe SMILES string part is: N2CCOC2=O.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- N2: this is the first atom, a nitrogen, with ring closure label 2.\n- Then comes C: attached to N2.\n- Then another C: attached to the previous C.\n- Then O: attached to the previous C.\n- Then C2=O: here, C2 refers to the second ring closure with label 2. The first label 2 was on the N, so this C is connected back to the N, forming a ring. But wait, that would make a ring of N-C-C-O-C(=O), connected back to the N. So that's a five-membered ring? N-C-C-O-C(=O)-N? That would make a five-membered ring, but the C(=O) is part of the ring. Wait, but the C with the =O is the same as the C in C2=O. So the ring is N-C-C-O-C(=O)-N. But that's a five-membered ring, which is possible. So the ring is a lactam structure, maybe like a pyrrolidone? Wait, pyrrolidone is a five-membered ring with a lactam. So yes, this part would be a morpholinone or similar. But morpholinone is a six-membered ring, I think. Wait, morpholine is O in a six-membered ring with two carbons between the O and N. So morpholinone would have a ketone. But this seems to be a five-membered ring. So maybe it's a pyrrolidone derivative.\n\nSo the substituent on the benzene ring in Molecule A is a CH2 group connected to this five-membered ring (N-C-C-O-C(=O)-). Then the benzene ring (c1cccc(CN2CCOC2=O)c1) has the substituent at position 4 (since the benzene is written as c1cccc... with the substituent in the fourth position? Or maybe the positions depend on the order. Let me see. The benzene ring is written as Nc1cccc(CN2...)c1. So the N is attached to position 1 of the benzene, then positions 2,3,4,5,6. The substituent is at position 4: the fourth c in the ccccc is followed by (CN2...). So the benzene ring has the substituent at position 4, which is a CH2 connected to the N2CCOC2=O ring.\n\nThen, going back to the main chain of Molecule A: CC(...)C(=O)NC(N)=O. The main chain is a central carbon (the first C) connected to another C (the methyl group, CC), then the N attached to the benzene ring. Then the central carbon is connected to a carbonyl group (C(=O)), then an NC(N)=O group. So the central part is a carbon connected to a methyl group, a benzene ring via an NH group, a carbonyl group, and then a urea group (NC(N)=O). Wait, the NC(N)=O is a urea? Because it's N connected to C(N)=O. So maybe it's a substituted urea. So the main structure might be a central carbon with four substituents: methyl, benzene-amine, carbonyl, and urea group.\n\nNow, looking at Molecule B: O=C(N)NC(C(C)Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O)=O. Let's parse this. The main chain starts with O=C(N)N... which is a carbonyl connected to an amine. Then comes C(...)=O. The central carbon here is attached to a C(C) group, which is connected to an N that's attached to a benzene ring (c1cc(ccc1)...). The benzene ring is written as c1cc(ccc1), which is a bit confusing. Let me parse the benzene part: c1cc(ccc1) would be benzene with substituents. The SMILES starts with c1, then cc, then (ccc1). Wait, perhaps it's c1 followed by two carbons (cc), then a group (ccc1). Wait, maybe the benzene is written as c1ccccc1, but here it's written as c1cc(ccc1). That would mean that after the first two carbons (positions 1 and 2), there's a branch with three carbons and then closing the ring. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the benzene ring is c1cc(ccc1). Let's break it down. The ring starts with c1, then two more carbons (c c), then a branch (ccc1). So positions 1,2,3, then a branch starting at position 3 with three more carbons (c c c), but that would not form a benzene ring. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here. Alternatively, the benzene ring is written as c1cc(ccc1), which would be positions 1,2, then at position 3, a substituent which is ccc1. But that can't form a benzene ring. Wait, perhaps the SMILES is incorrect, or maybe I'm misparsing it. Let me try again. The benzene part is c1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O. So after the benzene ring, there's a CH2 connected to N1CCOC1=O. Wait, maybe the benzene is c1cc(ccc1), which is actually a typo? Because a benzene ring is six-membered. The standard benzene SMILES is c1ccccc1. Here, it's written as c1cc(ccc1). So maybe it's a benzene ring where positions 3,4,5 are part of a branch. Wait, that can't form a ring. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is supposed to be c1ccc(CN1CCOC1=O)cc1, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is written correctly, and the benzene is c1cc(ccc1), which would mean that after the first two carbons, there's a branch with three carbons and then the ring closure. But that would make a five-membered ring, which isn't possible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the SMILES for Molecule B. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be c1cccc(CN1...)c1, similar to Molecule A.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the benzene ring in Molecule B is written as c1cc(ccc1). If the SMILES is c1cc(ccc1), that would be a benzene ring where after the first two carbons (positions 1 and 2), there's a branch with three carbons (c c c) and then closing the ring at position 1. But that would require the three carbons to form a bridge, which isn't possible. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the SMILES notation for Molecule B. However, given that this is the input, I need to work with it as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the benzene ring is correctly written as c1cc(ccc1), which might actually represent a benzene ring with a substituent. Let me think. The SMILES starts with c1 (ring closure 1), then two carbons (cc), then a branch (ccc1). So the main chain is c1 followed by two carbons, then a branch with three carbons and then closing the ring. That would be a total of 1 (from c1) + 2 (cc) + 3 (ccc1) = 6 atoms? Wait, no. The main chain is c1, c, c, then the branch is c, c, c1. So the main chain is three atoms (c1, c, c), and the branch is three atoms (c, c, c1). But that would form a six-membered ring if all are connected. Wait, perhaps the benzene ring is formed by c1, c, c, then a branch starting at the second c (position 2) which is c, c, c1. That would create a benzene ring: positions 1, 2, 3 (from main chain), and positions 2 (branch start), 3 (branch), 4 (branch), 1 (closure). Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the correct way is to consider that the benzene ring in Molecule B is actually c1ccc(CN1CCOC1=O)cc1, but the given SMILES is written as c1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O. Wait, perhaps the benzene is c1ccccc1 with a substituent at position 4. Let's assume that the SMILES for the benzene in Molecule B is c1cc(ccc1), which may actually be c1cccc(CN1...)c1, but perhaps the user made a typo.\n\nPutting that aside for a moment, the rest of Molecule B is O=C(N)NC(C(C)Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O)=O. The central part is NC(...)=O, where the N is connected to a carbon that has two substituents: C(C) and Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O. The C(C) is a methyl group attached to the central carbon. The other substituent is N attached to the benzene ring (c1cc(ccc1)), then a CH2 group connected to N1CCOC1=O. Wait, the N1CCOC1=O part: similar to Molecule A's N2CCOC2=O. So this would form a ring: N1 connected to C, C, O, C(=O), and back to N1. So again, a five-membered ring, same as in Molecule A. So the substituent on the benzene ring in Molecule B is CH2 connected to this five-membered lactam ring.\n\nNow, comparing the two molecules. The main differences might be in the arrangement of substituents around the central carbon. Molecule A has a central carbon (the first C in CC(Nc1...) connected to a methyl group (CC), then the N attached to the benzene, then the C(=O) connected to NC(N)=O. Molecule B's central part is O=C(N)NC(...)=O, where the central carbon is attached to C(C) (a methyl group), and the N attached to the benzene. Wait, perhaps the connectivity is different. Let me draw both structures.\n\nMolecule A's structure:\n- Central carbon (C) connected to:\n  - CH3 (from CC)\n  - NH attached to benzene ring (Nc1cccc(CN2CCOC2=O)c1)\n  - C(=O)\n  - N connected to C(N)=O (urea group)\n\nMolecule B's structure:\n- Central carbon (C) connected to:\n  - O=C(N)N (this is part of the main chain: O=C(N)-N-C(...)=O)\n  - The N is connected to a carbon which has:\n    - C(C) (methyl group)\n    - N attached to benzene ring (Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O)\n  - Then the central carbon is also connected to =O (from the C(...)=O)\n\nWait, perhaps the connectivity is different. Let me parse Molecule B again. The SMILES is O=C(N)NC(C(C)Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O)=O. Breaking it down:\n\n- O=C(N)N: this is the urea-like group, where the carbonyl is connected to N, which is connected to another N.\n- The next part is C(...)=O. So the structure is O=C(N)-N-C(...)=O. The central carbon here (the C in NC(...)=O) is connected to:\n  - N (from the urea part)\n  - C(C) (a methyl group, since C(C) is a carbon connected to another C, which is a methyl)\n  - Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O (the benzene ring part)\n  - =O\n\nSo the central carbon in Molecule B has substituents: N (from urea), methyl (C(C)), N-benzene group, and =O. Wait, but that would mean four substituents on a carbon, which is possible (tetrahedral geometry). But in Molecule A, the central carbon has substituents: methyl, NH-benzene, carbonyl, and urea group (N connected to C(N)=O). \n\nWait, comparing the substituents:\n\nMolecule A's central carbon substituents:\n1. CH3\n2. NH-benzene (with substituent)\n3. C=O\n4. N-C(N)=O (urea)\n\nMolecule B's central carbon substituents (the one attached to the urea N):\n1. N (from urea)\n2. CH(CH3) (since C(C) is a carbon attached to another C, which is methyl)\n3. NH-benzene (with substituent)\n4. =O\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Molecule B, the central carbon is the one in C(C(C)Nc1...)=O. So the substituents are:\n- C(C): which is a carbon attached to another C (methyl), so that's a CH2CH3 group? Wait, no. C(C) means the central carbon is connected to another carbon, which is itself connected to a methyl group. Wait, no. The SMILES is C(C(C)Nc1...). Let me clarify. The central carbon is part of the NC(...)=O group. The structure is N-C(...)=O. The ... part is C(C(C)Nc1...). So the central carbon (attached to N) has substituents:\n- C (connected to another C, which is methyl)\n- Nc1... (the benzene part)\n- =O\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's parse it step by step.\n\nMolecule B: O=C(N)NC(C(C)Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O)=O.\n\nStart from the left:\n\nO=C(N)-N-C(...)=O.\n\nThe C in between the two Ns (O=C(N)-N-C(...)=O) is the central carbon. This carbon is connected to:\n\n1. The N from O=C(N)-N-\n2. The group C(C(C)Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O)\n3. The =O\n\nWait, no. Wait, the SMILES is NC(...)=O. The N is connected to the C, which is connected to the rest. So the central carbon (C) is attached to:\n\n- N (from the urea part, O=C(N)-N-)\n- C(C) (a carbon attached to another C, which is a methyl group)\n- Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O (the benzene ring part)\n- =O (as the fourth substituent)\n\nSo the central carbon in Molecule B has substituents: N (urea), C(CH3), N-benzene, and O. Wait, but that would be four substituents, making it a quaternary carbon. Similarly, in Molecule A, the central carbon also has four substituents: CH3, NH-benzene, C=O, and N-urea.\n\nNow, the key is to see if the substituents are the same but arranged differently, leading to the same structure (possibly different tautomers or just different SMILES representations), or if they are different.\n\nLet me compare the substituents:\n\nIn Molecule A:\n- Substituent 1: CH3\n- Substituent 2: NH-benzene (with CH2-morpholinone substituent)\n- Substituent 3: C=O (as part of the carbonyl)\n- Substituent 4: NH-C(N)=O (urea group)\n\nIn Molecule B:\n- Substituent 1: N connected to O=C(N)- (urea)\n- Substituent 2: CH(CH3) (but wait, in SMILES, C(C) is a carbon connected to another carbon, which is a methyl group. So that's a CH2CH3 group? No, wait. The central carbon is connected to another C, which is connected to a methyl. So the structure is C(C) would be -C-C(CH3)? No, wait, the SMILES is C(C(C)...). Let me parse this part again. The part is C(C(C)Nc1...). The central carbon is connected to a C, which is connected to another C (methyl) and an N. Wait, no. The SMILES is C(C(C)Nc1...). Breaking it down: the central carbon (attached to the N from urea) is connected to another C. This C is connected to a methyl group (C) and an N (Nc1...). So the substituent here is a carbon connected to both a methyl group and the N-benzene group. So the structure is:\n\nCentral carbon (from the urea part) -> C -> (CH3 and N-benzene group). So that's a CH(CH3)(N-benzene) group.\n\nComparing to Molecule A's substituents:\n\nIn Molecule A, the central carbon has a CH3, NH-benzene, C=O, and N-urea.\n\nIn Molecule B, the central carbon has N-urea, CH(CH3)(N-benzene), and =O. Wait, but that would mean the substituents are different. Wait, no. Let me re-express both structures.\n\nMolecule A's structure:\n\nThe central carbon (let's call it C1) is connected to:\n- CH3 (from CC)\n- NH-benzene (N attached to benzene with substituent)\n- C=O\n- N-urea (N connected to C(N)=O)\n\nMolecule B's structure:\n\nThe central carbon (C2) is connected to:\n- N from urea (O=C(N)-N-)\n- CH(CH3) (from C(C) which is a carbon connected to another C (methyl) and the N-benzene)\n- =O\n\nWait, this seems different. In Molecule A, the urea group is attached to the central carbon via the N. In Molecule B, the urea group is part of the main chain, with the central carbon connected to the N of the urea. The substituents on the central carbons seem different. However, perhaps the two structures are actually the same but written in different orders.\n\nAnother approach: canonicalize the SMILES strings. If the canonical SMILES are the same, then the molecules are the same. However, since I can't compute that here, I need to mentally compare.\n\nAlternatively, check if the two SMILES strings are different representations of the same structure. For example, sometimes the order of substituents can vary, but the connectivity is the same.\n\nLooking at the benzene substituents:\n\nMolecule A's benzene has a CH2 connected to the morpholinone ring (N2CCOC2=O) at position 4 (assuming the NH is at position 1). Molecule B's benzene has a CH2 connected to the same morpholinone ring (N1CCOC1=O) but perhaps at a different position. However, the SMILES for the benzene in Molecule B is written as c1cc(ccc1), which may be incorrect, making it hard to determine the substituent position.\n\nAssuming that the benzene rings are the same (with substituent at position 4), then the morpholinone rings are the same.\n\nNow, looking at the main chain. In Molecule A, the central carbon is connected to CH3, NH-benzene, C=O, and N-urea. In Molecule B, the central carbon is connected to N-urea, CH(CH3)(N-benzene), and =O. Wait, but that can't be right. If in Molecule B, the central carbon is part of the urea group, then the connectivity might be different. Let me try to draw both structures.\n\nMolecule A's main chain:\n- C connected to CH3, NH-benzene, C=O, and N-C(N)=O (urea).\n\nMolecule B's main chain:\n- The urea is O=C(N)-N-C(...)=O. The C here is connected to:\n  - N from urea\n  - C(C) (which is a carbon connected to CH3 and N-benzene)\n  - =O\n\nSo the C in Molecule B's urea part has substituents N (urea), C(CH3)(N-benzene), and O. But in Molecule A, the central carbon has CH3, NH-benzene, C=O, and N-urea. These substituents are the same but ordered differently. Because in Molecule A, the C=O is a separate substituent, while in Molecule B, the =O is part of the urea group.\n\nWait, but in Molecule A, the C=O is part of the central carbon, and the N-urea is attached to that. Whereas in Molecule B, the C=O is part of the urea group, which is connected to the central carbon. This might indicate that the structures are actually the same. Because the urea group (N-C(=O)-N-) can be part of the same structure arranged differently in the SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two structures are enantiomers or different conformations, but SMILES doesn't account for stereochemistry unless specified. However, the question is whether they are the same molecule, so stereochemistry would matter only if specified.\n\nBut wait, the key is connectivity. Let's see:\n\nIn Molecule A, the structure is:\n\nCentral carbon (C1) attached to:\n- CH3\n- NH-benzene\n- C(=O)\n- N-C(N)=O (urea)\n\nIn Molecule B, the structure is:\n\nCentral carbon (C2) attached to:\n- N from O=C(N)-N-\n- C(CH3)(NH-benzene)\n- =O\n\nWait, but in Molecule B, the central carbon (C2) has the =O as a substituent, whereas in Molecule A, the C=O is part of the central carbon. So are these the same? Let's see: if the central carbon in A has a C=O group, and in B it has a =O substituent, that's the same thing. The C=O is a carbonyl group attached to the central carbon.\n\nWait, no. In SMILES, C(=O) is a carbonyl group. So in Molecule A, the central carbon is connected to a carbonyl (C(=O)), which is then connected to the N of the urea. In Molecule B, the central carbon is part of the urea group: O=C(N)-N-C(...)=O. So the structure is a urea where one of the N's is connected to a central carbon that has substituents.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire structure is the same but written in a different order. Let me try to write both as trees.\n\nMolecule A:\n\n- Central carbon (C1)\n  - CH3\n  - NH-benzene\n  - C(=O)-N-C(N)=O (this is a carbonyl connected to N, which is connected to another C(N)=O, forming a urea group)\n\nMolecule B:\n\n- Urea group: O=C(N)-N-C(C)(N-benzene)=O\n\nWait, that would make the central carbon (attached to the urea N) have substituents:\n- C (which is connected to CH3 and N-benzene)\n- =O\n\nSo the structure would be O=C(N)-N-C(C(CH3)(N-benzene))=O. But that's a different arrangement compared to Molecule A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two structures are tautomers or different representations. However, urea groups are generally not tautomeric. So if the connectivity is different, they are different molecules.\n\nAnother angle: the count of atoms. Let's count the atoms in both SMILES.\n\nMolecule A: CC(Nc1cccc(CN2CCOC2=O)c1)C(=O)NC(N)=O\n\nBreaking down:\n- CC(...)C(=O)NC(N)=O: the main chain has 2 carbons (the first two Cs), then a C(=O), N, C(N)=O. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, with a CH2 connected to the morpholinone ring. The morpholinone ring has N, C, C, O, C(=O).\n\nMolecule B: O=C(N)NC(C(C)Nc1cc(ccc1)CN1CCOC1=O)=O\n\nBreaking down:\n- O=C(N)NC(...)=O: the urea part has O, C, N, N, C(...)=O. The central carbon has C connected to C(C) (which is a CH2CH3?), N-benzene, and the morpholinone ring.\n\nBut without drawing, it's hard to see. Another approach: check if the two SMILES can be canonicalized to the same string. But since I can't do that here, I'll have to rely on connectivity.\n\nIn Molecule A, the urea group is attached to the central carbon via the N. In Molecule B, the urea group is part of the main chain, with the central carbon being part of the urea. Therefore, the connectivity is different. For example, in A, the urea is a substituent on the central carbon, while in B, the central carbon is part of the urea group.\n\nTherefore, the two molecules are different. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Let me try again.\n\nMolecule A: The central carbon is connected to C(=O)NC(N)=O. That is, the central carbon is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is connected to an N, which is connected to a C(N)=O. So the structure is:\n\nCentral C -> C(=O) -> N -> C(N)=O. This forms a urea group: N-C(=O)-N-C(=O). Wait, no. The C(N)=O is a carbamoyl group. So the structure after the central carbon is C(=O)-N-C(N)=O. That's a glycine-like group with a urea substitution.\n\nMolecule B's structure is O=C(N)-N-C(...)=O. So the urea is O=C(N)-N-C(...)=O, which is a different arrangement. The central carbon here is the one attached to the N of the urea. \n\nSo in Molecule A, the urea is N-C(=O)-N-C(=O), while in Molecule B, it's O=C(N)-N-C(...)=O. These are different connectivities. Therefore, the two molecules are different.\n\nWait, but urea is typically H2NCONH2. In Molecule A, the group is NC(N)=O, which is NH-C(=O)-NH2. In Molecule B, the group is O=C(N)-N-..., which is similar but attached to different positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES representations are different but the structures are the same. For example, the central carbon in A has a C(=O) connected to N-C(N)=O, while in B, the central carbon is part of the urea group. But I think the connectivities are different, making the molecules different.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No, they are not the same molecule.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to determine if Molecule A and Molecule B are the same based on their SMILES strings. First, I'll look at the SMILES for both and try to parse them mentally.\n\nMolecule A: O=C(CSc1cccc[n+]1[O-])Nc1ccccc1Oc1ccccc1. Breaking this down, there's a carbonyl group (O=C) attached to a carbon which is connected to a sulfur (S) and a cyclopentadienyl-like ring. The ring has a nitrogen with a positive charge and an oxygen with a negative charge. Then there's an aniline group (N attached to benzene), which is connected via an oxygen to another benzene ring. So maybe it's a structure where the carbonyl is connected to a thioether ring, then linked to an aniline-O-benzene.\n\nMolecule B: c1ccc[n+](c1SCC(Nc1c(cccc1)Oc1ccccc1)=O)[O-]. Let's parse this. The ring starts with c1ccc, then a nitrogen with a positive charge [n+], which has substituents. One substituent is the benzene ring (c1SCC...). The sulfur is part of a chain: S connected to CC, which is connected to a carbonyl (=O). Then there's an N attached to a benzene ring that has an oxygen connected to another benzene. Wait, the substituents on the nitrogen might be the same as in Molecule A. \n\nLooking closer, in Molecule B, the main ring is a benzene (c1ccc...) with the nitrogen in the ring. The substituents on the nitrogen include a thioether group (SCC...). The SCC is connected to a carbonyl and then to an N which is attached to a benzene-O-benzene group. \n\nComparing the two, the key is whether the connectivity is the same. Molecule A's structure is O=C attached to a C connected to S, which is part of a ring. Then the N is attached to the benzene-O-benzene. Molecule B's structure starts with the ring, where the nitrogen is part of the ring and has substituents including the S-CC(=O)-N... part. \n\nWait, maybe they're the same but written in different orders. SMILES can have different representations based on the starting point and branching. Let me try to map the atoms. \n\nIn Molecule A: The central part is the carbonyl group (O=C) connected to a carbon that has a sulfur (S) and a cyclo ring (c1cccc[n+]1[O-]). Then the nitrogen (N) is attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) which is connected via oxygen to another benzene (Oc1ccccc1).\n\nIn Molecule B: The main ring is benzene (c1ccc...) with a nitrogen in the ring ([n+]). The substituent on the nitrogen is a sulfur (S) connected to CC(=O)N... The CC(=O)N part is similar to Molecule A's C(O)=N. Then the N is attached to a benzene ring that has an oxygen connected to another benzene. \n\nWait, maybe the difference is in how the rings are closed. For example, in Molecule A, the sulfur is part of the ring? Let's look again. Molecule A's SMILES: O=C(CSc1cccc[n+]1[O-])Nc1ccccc1Oc1ccccc1. The part after the carbonyl is (CSc1cccc[n+]1[O-]). So the carbon after S is connected to the ring c1cccc[n+]1[O-]. The ring closure here is positions 1, so the S is attached to the carbon, which is connected to the ring. So the ring is five-membered: positions 1 (S), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (c), and then [n+] at position 6? Wait, no. Let me count: the ring starts at position 1. The SMILES is CSc1cccc[n+]1[O-]. So the S is attached to a carbon (C), which is connected to the ring atom 1 (c). Then the ring has four more carbons (cccc), then a [n+] (which is atom 6?), then back to position 1 (the 1 at the end). So the ring is five-membered: positions 1 (c), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (c), but wait, that would be five. Wait, the SMILES is c1cccc[n+]1[O-], which is a five-membered ring? Let me count:\n\nc1 (ring start), then c, c, c, c (four c's), then [n+] (ring closure back to 1). So that's five atoms: c1 (1), c (2), c (3), c (4), c (5), [n+]1 (ring closure to 1). Wait, that would make the ring have six atoms? No, because c1 is the first atom, then four more c's (positions 2-5), then [n+] which is position 6, and the closure is to 1. That would create a six-membered ring? But then the numbers would be 1 (c), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (c), 6 (n+), and closing back to 1. So a six-membered ring with five carbons and one nitrogen. But the SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to indicate where the ring closure happens. So c1cccc[n+]1 would be a six-membered ring: positions 1 (c), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (c), 6 (n+), connected back to 1. So that's a six-membered ring. Then the [O-] is attached to the n+.\n\nIn Molecule B's SMILES: c1ccc[n+](c1SCC(Nc1c(cccc1)Oc1ccccc1)=O)[O-]. Here, the main ring is c1ccc... The [n+] is part of the ring. The substituents on the [n+] are: a benzene ring (c1SCC...), and the [O-]. Let's parse the substituents. The [n+] has two substituents: one is the benzene ring (c1SCC...), and the other is the [O-]. Wait, the SMILES is c1ccc[n+](c1SCC(...)=O)[O-]. So the [n+] is part of a benzene ring (positions 1 to 6). The substituents on the [n+] are the group (c1SCC...) and the [O-]. The c1SCC... part: the c1 here is a new benzene ring (since the previous c1 was the main ring). So the substituent is a benzene ring (c1) attached to S, then CC(=O)N... \n\nWait, maybe the SMILES for Molecule B is a benzene ring (c1ccc...) with the [n+] in the ring, and substituents on the [n+] being a benzene-S-CC(=O)-N... group and an [O-]. \n\nComparing to Molecule A, which has a six-membered ring (c1cccc[n+]1[O-]) attached via S to a carbon connected to the carbonyl. Then the N is attached to a benzene-O-benzene.\n\nIn Molecule B, the N in the ring has a substituent that is a benzene-S-CC(=O)-N... group. Wait, perhaps the connectivity is different. In Molecule A, the S is part of the chain leading to the ring, while in Molecule B, the S is part of a substituent on the [n+] ring.\n\nWait, maybe they are the same but written differently. Let me try to draw both structures mentally.\n\nMolecule A: The main chain is O=C connected to a carbon that has a sulfur (S) connected to a six-membered ring (with five C and one N+). The N is connected to a benzene ring (O-connected to another benzene).\n\nMolecule B: The main structure is a benzene ring with an N+ in the ring. The N+ has an O- as a substituent and a benzene-S-CC(=O)-N-(benzene-O-benzene) group.\n\nWait, perhaps the difference is that in Molecule A, the S is part of the chain (C-S-C-ring), while in Molecule B, the S is part of a substituent (benzene-S-CC...). But maybe they are the same structure, just written starting from different points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are different in how the substituents are arranged. For example, in Molecule A, the N is part of the aniline group connected to the O-benzene, while in Molecule B, the N is part of the ring. Wait, no. In Molecule A, the N is part of the amide group (O=C-N...), which is connected to the benzene-O-benzene. In Molecule B, the N is part of the ring (the [n+]) and also part of the amide group (the N in the NCC(=O)... part. Wait, perhaps not. Let me parse Molecule B again.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES: c1ccc[n+](c1SCC(Nc1c(cccc1)Oc1ccccc1)=O)[O-]. Breaking it down:\n\n- The main ring is c1ccc[n+]... . The [n+] is part of the benzene ring (positions 1-6, with the [n+] at position 5 perhaps). The substituents on the [n+] are the group (c1SCC(...)=O) and the [O-]. \n\nThe substituent c1SCC(...) is a benzene ring (c1) attached to S, which is connected to CC(=O)... The CC(=O) is connected to an N, which is attached to a benzene ring (c1c(cccc1)Oc1ccccc1). This benzene ring has an oxygen connected to another benzene.\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nMain ring (benzene with [n+] and O- substituent) \u2192 substituent on [n+] is a benzene-S-CH2-C(=O)-NH-(benzene-O-benzene).\n\nIn Molecule A, the structure is:\n\nO=C-CH2-S-(six-membered ring with [n+] and O- substituent) \u2192 connected via NH to benzene-O-benzene.\n\nWait, perhaps the two structures are the same but written in different orders. Let me check the connectivity.\n\nIn Molecule A, the amide is O=C-NH-..., whereas in Molecule B, the amide is part of the substituent: CC(=O)N... So perhaps the amide group is the same but attached in different positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the core structure is the same. For example, in Molecule A, the S is attached to the carbon chain (C-S-C), which is connected to the ring. In Molecule B, the S is attached to the benzene ring, which is a substituent on the [n+] ring.\n\nWait, but maybe the ring in Molecule A is the same as the main ring in Molecule B. Let me compare the rings. Molecule A's ring is c1cccc[n+]1[O-], which is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one nitrogen, and the O- attached to the nitrogen. Molecule B's main ring is c1ccc[n+]... with substituents. Wait, the main ring in Molecule B is a benzene (six carbons), but with one of the carbons replaced by [n+]?\n\nNo, wait, the main ring in Molecule B is c1ccc[n+](...)[O-]. So the ring is c1 (carbon 1), then three more carbons (positions 2,3,4), then the [n+] at position 5, then another carbon (position 6), closing back to position 1. So it's a six-membered ring with five carbons and one nitrogen. The [n+] has two substituents: the group starting with c1SCC... and the [O-].\n\nIn Molecule A, the ring is six-membered with five carbons and one nitrogen, with the [O-] attached to the nitrogen. The nitrogen is also part of the ring. So both rings have the same structure: a six-membered ring with five carbons and one nitrogen, with an oxygen negative charge on the nitrogen. But in Molecule B, the main ring has the [n+] as part of the ring, with substituents. In Molecule A, the ring is a substituent attached via S to the rest of the molecule.\n\nWait, perhaps the two structures are identical but written with different starting points. For example, in Molecule A, the starting point is the carbonyl group, while in Molecule B, the starting point is the benzene ring with the [n+]. The rest of the structure could be the same when considering connectivity.\n\nLet me try to map the atoms:\n\nIn Molecule A: O=C(C-S-(ring))-NH-(benzene-O-benzene).\n\nIn Molecule B: benzene ring with [n+] (which has substituents S-CC(=O)-NH-(benzene-O-benzene) and [O-].\n\nIf I break down the substituent on the [n+] in Molecule B: the S is attached to a benzene ring (c1), then connected to CC(=O)NH... Wait, but in Molecule A, the S is part of a chain connected to the ring. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the key difference is whether the S is part of a benzene ring or part of a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are different representations of the same molecule. For example, the ring in Molecule B's substituent (c1SCC...) is a benzene ring attached to S, but in Molecule A, the S is connected to a carbon that's part of the ring. Wait, no. In Molecule A, the S is attached to a carbon (the C in CSc1...), which is connected to the ring (c1...). So the S is part of a chain (C-S-C-ring), whereas in Molecule B, the S is attached directly to a benzene ring (c1S...).\n\nWait, that's different. In Molecule B, the S is attached to a benzene ring (c1), then connected to CC(=O)N..., whereas in Molecule A, the S is part of a chain (C-S-C) leading to the ring. Therefore, the connectivity is different. That would suggest they are different molecules.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading the SMILES. Let's look at Molecule B's substituent on the [n+]: c1SCC(...). The c1 here refers to a benzene ring (since the digits reset in each branch). So the substituent is a benzene ring (c1) attached to S, which is connected to CC(=O)N... So that would be a benzene-S-CH2-C(=O)-NH... group. In Molecule A, the S is part of a chain: C-S-C connected to the ring. So in Molecule A, the S is attached to a carbon that's connected to the ring, while in Molecule B, the S is attached to a benzene ring. Therefore, the structures are different.\n\nSo in Molecule A, the S is in a chain: O=C-CH2-S-(ring), whereas in Molecule B, the S is attached directly to a benzene ring (benzene-S-CH2-C(=O)-NH...). Therefore, the two molecules have different substituents on the S, making them different compounds. Hence, the answer should be No.",

Let's start by looking at Molecule A and Molecule B. \n\nMolecule A: O=C(NCCCN1CCOCC1)c1ccc2c(=O)n(Cc3ccc(Cl)cc3)c(=O)[nH]c2c1\nMolecule B: c1c(C(=O)NCCCN2CCOCC2)ccc2c(=O)n(c(=O)[nH]c21)Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse both SMILES. SMILES can sometimes be written in different orders but still represent the same structure. So maybe the order of the atoms or the ring numbering is different, but the actual connectivity is the same.\n\nLooking at Molecule A: The main chain seems to start with a carbonyl group (O=C) attached to an amine (N) connected to a chain of three CH2 groups (NCCC...). Then there's a nitrogen connected to a cyclohexane ring (N1CCOCC1), which is a morpholine ring. The carbonyl is then attached to a benzene ring (c1ccc...). The benzene has a substituent at position 1 (from the c1). Then there's a fused ring structure: the benzene (c1) is connected to another ring (c2) which has two ketone groups (c(=O)), an amine (n) with a substituent (Cc3ccc(Cl)cc3) which is a benzyl group with a chlorine, and another ketone and an NH group (c(=O)[nH]c2c1). \n\nMolecule B starts with a benzene ring (c1c(...)ccc2...). The substituent on the benzene is C(=O)NCCCN2CCOCC2, which is the same morpholine chain as in A. Then the benzene is connected to another ring (c2) with similar groups: c(=O)n(...) which might be part of a fused ring. The substituent on the nitrogen here is c(=O)[nH]c21, which seems like a fused ring between the benzene (c1) and the second ring (c2). Then there's a Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1 group, which is the same benzyl chloride as in A.\n\nWait, the ring numbering might be different. In SMILES, the order in which the atoms are written and the ring closures (like numbers) can vary, but the actual structure depends on connectivity. The key is to check if all the groups are connected in the same way.\n\nLet me try to break down both structures step by step.\n\nFor Molecule A:\n- The main chain is O=C(NCCCN1CCOCC1) attached to a benzene ring (c1...).\n- The benzene (c1) has a substituent at position 1 (since it's the first carbon in the SMILES string) which connects to a fused ring (c2). The fused ring has two ketone groups, an NH group, and a nitrogen attached to a benzyl chloride group (Cc3ccc(Cl)cc3).\n\nFor Molecule B:\n- The main benzene ring is written as c1c(...)ccc2...\n- The substituent at position 2 (since it's the second character in c1c(...)) is the same morpholine chain: C(=O)NCCCN2CCOCC2.\n- Then the benzene is connected to a fused ring (c2) with ketones and a nitrogen substituent. The nitrogen here is attached to the same benzyl chloride group (Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1).\n\nWait, in Molecule B, the benzyl chloride is written as Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1. That's a benzene ring (c1) with a chlorine in the para position (positions 4, since the SMILES is c1ccc(Cl)cc1). So the benzyl group is attached via the CH2 (Cc1...) to the nitrogen.\n\nComparing the substituents:\n- Both have a morpholine ring (NCCCN2CCOCC2 in A vs NCCCN2CCOCC2 in B). That's the same.\n- Both have a benzyl chloride group (Cc3ccc(Cl)cc3 in A, Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1 in B). The numbering here (3 vs 1) doesn't matter as it's just a label for the ring. The structure is the same: benzyl with Cl para.\n- The fused ring system in both cases is a benzene ring fused to another ring (possibly a quinazoline or similar). Let me see: in A, the benzene (c1) is connected to a ring (c2) which has two ketones, an NH, and the substituents. In B, the benzene (c1) is connected to the same fused ring (c2), with the same substituents.\n\nThe difference might be in how the fused rings are connected. Let me draw this mentally. In SMILES, the order of the atoms in the ring closures can affect the perceived structure, but if all the connections are the same, they are the same molecule.\n\nAnother thing to check is the position of the substituents on the benzene rings. In Molecule A, the main benzene (c1) is written as c1ccc2..., so the substituent (from the O=C group) is at position 1, then positions 2,3,4 are part of the ring, and the fused ring starts at position 5? Or maybe the numbering is different. Similarly, in Molecule B, the main benzene starts with c1c(...)ccc2..., so the substituent (C(=O)N...) is at position 2. Wait, that could be a key difference. Let me parse the benzene rings again.\n\nIn SMILES, the order in which the atoms are written defines their positions. For example, c1ccc2... would have the first carbon as position 1, then next as 2, etc., but when a ring closure is involved, the numbers indicate connections.\n\nWait, let's parse Molecule A's benzene:\n\nc1ccc2c(=O)n(...)c2c1\n\nThe benzene ring is c1, then after three carbons (c c c), we hit a ring closure to c2. So the benzene ring is positions 1-6. The substituents would be at position 1 (from the O=C group), and the fused ring starts at position 4 (since after three carbons, the fourth is the start of the fused ring). So the fused ring is connected at positions 4 and 5 of the benzene, perhaps forming a bicyclic system like a quinazoline.\n\nIn Molecule B, the benzene is c1c(...)ccc2...\n\nSo position 1 is the first c, position 2 is the next c (with the substituent C(=O)N...), then positions 3,4,5 are c c c, and then the fused ring starts at position 6 (c2). So the fused ring would be connected at positions 2 and 6 of the benzene. Wait, but that can't be right. Let me try to map it.\n\nAlternatively, the SMILES for B is:\n\nc1c(C(=O)NCCCN2CCOCC2)ccc2c(=O)n(c(=O)[nH]c21)Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- The benzene ring is c1. The first carbon (position 1) is connected to another carbon (c1c(...)), which is part of the substituent C(=O)N... So the substituent is at position 1? Wait, SMILES is tricky. Let me parse step by step.\n\nThe SMILES starts with c1c(...), which means the first atom in the SMILES string is part of ring 1 (c1). The second atom is another carbon (the second 'c'), which is connected to the substituent C(=O)NCCCN2CCOCC2. So the substituent is on the second carbon of the benzene ring (since the first two atoms are c1 and c). Then we have three more carbons (ccc), then a ring closure to c2. So the benzene ring is positions 1-6. The substituent (C=O) is on position 2. Then the fused ring starts at position 6 (since after ccc, the next is c2). So the fused ring connects to position 6 of the benzene. Then the fused ring (c2) has a ketone, an amine group with substituents, etc.\n\nSo in Molecule A, the substituent (C=O) is on position 1 of the benzene, and the fused ring starts at position 4. In Molecule B, the substituent is on position 2, and the fused ring starts at position 6. That would suggest that the substituents are in different positions, making them different molecules. But wait, maybe the numbering is different due to SMILES' flexibility. Because in SMILES, the same molecule can be written with different numbering depending on the starting point and direction.\n\nWait, benzene rings are symmetrical, so the position of substituents can be rotated. For example, if in one SMILES the substituent is on position 1, and in another SMILES it's on position 2, but due to the ring's symmetry, they could be the same. However, if the fused ring's position changes, that could affect the structure.\n\nBut in this case, the fused ring's position relative to the substituent matters. For example, if in Molecule A, the substituent (C=O) is on position 1, and the fused ring starts at position 4, then the substituent is adjacent to the fused ring. In Molecule B, if the substituent is on position 2 and the fused ring starts at position 6, then the substituent would be two positions away from the fused ring. But depending on the direction of numbering (clockwise or counter-clockwise), this could be equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two SMILES strings are just different representations of the same structure due to different starting points in the benzene ring. For example, if in Molecule A, the benzene starts with the substituent at position 1, and in Molecule B, the starting point is shifted, making the substituent appear at a different position but actually being the same when considering the ring's symmetry.\n\nBut benzene rings are symmetrical, so substituent positions can be equivalent if the numbering is rotated. However, when there's a fused ring, the positions are fixed relative to each other. For example, if the fused ring is in a certain position relative to the substituent, rotating the numbering could make the substituent's position change, but the fused ring's position would also rotate accordingly.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose in Molecule A, the benzene ring has the substituent (C=O) at position 1 and the fused ring starts at position 4. In Molecule B, the substituent is at position 2 and the fused ring at position 6. If the benzene is numbered in the opposite direction, position 1 in A could be position 2 in B, and position 4 in A (which is three positions away clockwise) could be position 6 in B (three positions away counter-clockwise). So depending on the direction of numbering, the substituent and fused ring positions could match up.\n\nAlternatively, the fused rings' positions are the same relative to the substituent. Let me visualize:\n\nIn a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other. So if substituent is at 1, and the fused ring starts at 4, then substituent is opposite the fused ring. But in Molecule B, substituent is at 2 and fused ring at 6. Position 2 and 6 are adjacent (since benzene is a 6-membered ring). So substituent at 2 and fused ring at 6 would mean they are next to each other. That's a different arrangement than substituent at 1 and fused ring at 4 (opposite). Therefore, the molecules would be different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me try to assign actual positions.\n\nIn SMILES, the order of writing determines the numbering. For example, a benzene written as c1ccccc1 would have positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in the order written. If the SMILES starts at a different position, the numbers change but the structure remains the same.\n\nSo in Molecule A, the benzene is written as c1ccc2c(...)c2c1. The first four carbons are c1, then c, c, c, then the fourth carbon connects to the fused ring (c2). So the substituent (from O=C) is on the first carbon (position 1), then positions 2, 3, 4 are part of the benzene. Position 4 is connected to the fused ring. Then after the fused ring part, it closes back to position 1 (c2c1). So the fused ring is between positions 4 and 5 of the benzene.\n\nIn Molecule B, the benzene is written as c1c(...)ccc2... The first carbon is c1, the second carbon has the substituent (C=O), then positions 3,4,5 are c c c, and then position 6 connects to the fused ring (c2). So the fused ring is between positions 6 and 1 of the benzene. Wait, but how does that work? The fused ring would connect to position 6 and then back to position 1 (since it's c2... then c21 at the end, which closes the ring between c2 and c1).\n\nSo in Molecule A, the fused ring is between positions 4 and 5 of the benzene, and in Molecule B, it's between positions 6 and 1. However, depending on the direction of numbering, these could be the same. For example, if you start numbering the benzene from a different point, the positions would rotate. But in SMILES, the actual connectivity matters, not the numbering.\n\nWait, but the fused ring's position relative to the substituent (C=O) would determine if they are the same. In Molecule A, substituent is at position 1, and the fused ring spans positions 4-5. In Molecule B, substituent is at position 2, and the fused ring spans positions 6-1. If the benzene is numbered differently, these could be the same positions. For example, if in Molecule B, the benzene is numbered such that position 2 in B is equivalent to position 1 in A, then the fused ring positions would adjust accordingly. However, SMILES strings can vary in how they are written, but the actual structure is determined by connectivity.\n\nAnother approach is to canonicalize both SMILES. Canonical SMILES ensure that the same molecule is represented by the same string. If the two SMILES canonicalize to the same string, they are the same. But since I can't do that here manually, I need to analyze the connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for any differences in substituent positions. Let's check the substituents attached to the nitrogens in the fused rings.\n\nIn Molecule A: the nitrogen in the fused ring (n(...)) has a substituent Cc3ccc(Cl)cc3, which is a benzyl chloride group attached to the nitrogen.\n\nIn Molecule B: the nitrogen in the fused ring (n(...)) has substituent c(=O)[nH]c21 and the benzyl chloride is attached via the nitrogen as well: n(...)Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1. Wait, let me parse that part again.\n\nIn Molecule B's SMILES: ...n(c(=O)[nH]c21)Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1.\n\nThe nitrogen (n) has two substituents: one is the group c(=O)[nH]c21, which is part of the fused ring, and the other is Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (the benzyl chloride). So the nitrogen is attached to both the fused ring part and the benzyl chloride. That matches Molecule A's structure where the nitrogen in the fused ring is attached to the benzyl chloride. So that part seems the same.\n\nThe key difference seems to be the position of the substituent (C=O) group on the benzene ring relative to the fused ring. In Molecule A, the substituent is at position 1, and the fused ring is between positions 4 and 5. In Molecule B, the substituent is at position 2, and the fused ring is between positions 6 and 1. \n\nIf these positions are different in the benzene ring, then the molecules are structural isomers. However, benzene rings are symmetric, so sometimes different numbering can represent the same structure. For example, if the substituent and fused ring are in positions that are equivalent under rotation, then the molecules are the same. But if their positions are not equivalent, then they are different.\n\nLet me imagine the benzene ring. In Molecule A, substituent is at position 1, fused ring at 4-5. In Molecule B, substituent at 2, fused ring at 6-1. If we rotate the benzene so that position 2 becomes position 1, then the fused ring would be at positions 6-1 (original numbering) which would become positions 5-6 in the new numbering. But this might not align with the substituent's position. Alternatively, maybe the substituent and fused ring positions are adjacent in one case and not in the other, leading to different structures.\n\nWait, if in A the substituent is at position 1 and the fused ring is at 4-5, then the substituent is opposite the fused ring. In B, substituent at 2 and fused ring at 6-1 (which is adjacent to position 1), so the substituent is next to the fused ring. That would mean the substituent is in a different position relative to the fused ring, making the molecules different.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the positions. Let's number the benzene in both cases:\n\nFor Molecule A's benzene (c1ccc2...):\n\n1 (C=O substituent)\n2 (c)\n3 (c)\n4 (c) connected to c2 (start of fused ring)\n5 (part of fused ring)\n6 (back to c1)\n\nSo the fused ring is between positions 4 and 5, making the substituent at 1 opposite the fused ring.\n\nFor Molecule B's benzene (c1c(...)ccc2...):\n\n1 (c)\n2 (C=O substituent)\n3 (c)\n4 (c)\n5 (c)\n6 (connected to c2, start of fused ring)\n\nSo the fused ring is between positions 6 and 1 (since the closure is c21 at the end). Therefore, the substituent at position 2 is adjacent to position 1, which is connected to the fused ring. So substituent at 2 is next to the fused ring (positions 6 and 1 are adjacent to position 2). So the substituent is adjacent to the fused ring in B, but opposite in A. This would make them different molecules because the substituent's position relative to the fused ring is different.\n\nTherefore, the two SMILES represent different molecules, so the answer should be No.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Let's look at Molecule A: Fc1ccc(-c2nc3cc[nH]cc-3n2)cc1. The fluorine is attached to the benzene ring at position 1. The benzene ring (c1ccc...) has a substituent at the fourth carbon (since the indices go in order). The substituent is -c2nc3cc[nH]cc3n2. That part looks like a bicyclic structure. Let me parse that. The c2 is connected to a nitrogen (n), then a c3 which is part of another ring: cc[nH]cc3. So the second ring is a five-membered ring with a nitrogen at position 2 (since the numbering starts at c3). The [nH] indicates a hydrogen on the nitrogen. Then back to c2 which is connected to n2. So maybe it's a pyrazole ring or something similar?\n\nNow Molecule B: c1[nH]ccc2-c1nc(n2)-c1ccc(cc1)F. Let's break this down. The first part is c1[nH]ccc2. That's a five-membered ring starting with c1, then [nH], then three carbons (ccc), and then c2. The hyphen after c2 indicates a connection. Then -c1nc(n2)-... So the c1 here is part of the previous ring? Wait, maybe the first part is a ring closure. Let's see: c1[nH]ccc2 forms a five-membered ring where c1 is connected to c2 via the four c's. Then the hyphen connects to another part. The next part is -c1nc(n2)-. Wait, the c1 here might be part of a new ring? Or is it the same as the previous c1? Wait, SMILES uses different numbers for different rings. So the first ring is c1 and c2 as closure. Then the next part is -c1... which would start a new ring? Hmm, maybe not. Let me try to draw this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic system. The first ring is c1[nH]ccc2 (positions 1 to 5?), then connected to c2 via the hyphen. Then -c1nc(n2)-... Wait, this is confusing. Let me parse it again. The SMILES starts with c1[nH]ccc2, which would form a five-membered ring where atom 1 is a carbon, followed by a nitrogen with a hydrogen, then three carbons, and then atom 2. Then, there's a hyphen connecting to -c1nc(n2)-. Wait, using c1 again here would start a new ring. But that's not allowed unless it's a different ring. Wait, no, SMILES allows the same number to be reused once the ring is closed. So maybe the first part is ring 1 (c1, nH, c, c, c2), and then the second part starts another ring. Let's see: the hyphen after c2 connects to a new carbon (c1), which is part of another ring? Or maybe it's a bridge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic where the two rings are connected. Let's try to parse the entire SMILES:\n\nc1[nH]ccc2-c1nc(n2)-c1ccc(cc1)F.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- c1: start of a ring.\n- [nH]: next atom is a nitrogen with a hydrogen.\n- ccc2: three carbons, then ring closure to atom 2 (which is the fifth atom in this ring, making a five-membered ring: positions 1 (c), 2 (nH), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (c2)).\n\nThen the hyphen connects to -c1nc(n2)-. Wait, but c1 here would refer back to the first atom of the previous ring? That can't be. Wait, no, in SMILES, once you close a ring, you can reuse the numbers. So the first ring is closed with c2, so the next part starts with -c1, which is a new ring closure. But this is getting complicated. Let's try to visualize step by step.\n\nMolecule B: The first part is c1[nH]ccc2. That's a ring where c1 is connected to [nH], then three carbons, then closing to c2. So the first ring is a five-membered ring: C1 connected to N(H), then C3, C4, C5 (which is c2). Then we have -c1nc(n2)-. The hyphen after c2 indicates a single bond to the next atom, which is c1 (but c1 was already used in the first ring). Wait, maybe that's a typo. Or perhaps the SMILES is written with a bridge. Alternatively, maybe the hyphen is part of the ring closure. Wait, maybe the structure is like this: after the first ring (c1[nH]ccc2), the next part is connected via a single bond to c1 (which is the first atom of the first ring?), then nc(n2). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is written as follows:\n\nThe main structure has two rings connected by a single bond. The first ring is a five-membered ring with a nitrogen. The second part is a benzene ring with fluorine. Let me try to parse Molecule B again.\n\nMolecule B: c1[nH]ccc2-c1nc(n2)-c1ccc(cc1)F.\n\nLet me break it into parts:\n\n1. c1[nH]ccc2: creates a five-membered ring. Positions 1 (carbon), 2 (NH), 3 (carbon), 4 (carbon), 5 (carbon 2). So the ring is C-C-NH-C-C-C (but wait, five members: c1, nH, c, c, c2).\n\nThen -c1nc(n2)-: the hyphen after c2 connects to a new carbon (c1, which is part of a new ring?), then n, c, (n2). The n2 here refers back to the second closure point? Or is this part of another ring?\n\nThen -c1ccc(cc1)F: this part starts with a carbon connected to the previous part, then forms another benzene ring (c1ccc(cc1)F), which is a benzene ring with fluorine attached.\n\nWait, maybe the structure is:\n\nThe main part is a bicyclic system. The first ring is a five-membered ring (from c1[nH]ccc2), connected via a single bond to another ring. The next part is -c1nc(n2)-, which might form a bridge between the two rings. Then the benzene ring with fluorine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is structured as follows:\n\n- The first ring is a five-membered ring (c1[nH]ccc2), connected to another ring via a single bond. The second part is a six-membered ring with a fluorine substituent.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to canonicalize both SMILES strings and see if they match.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to draw both structures and see if they are the same.\n\nMolecule A: Fluorobenzene (F attached to benzene) connected to a bicyclic heterocycle. The substituent on the benzene is -c2nc3cc[nH]cc3n2. Let's parse that. The group starts with a carbon connected to a nitrogen (c2nc3...). Then the c3 is part of a ring: cc[nH]cc3. So that's a five-membered ring: positions 3 (c3), 4 (c), 5 ([nH]), 6 (c), 7 (c), but wait, that's five atoms. Wait, the ring closure is at c3, so starting at c3, then c, then [nH], c, c, and back to c3. So that's a five-membered ring: c3, c4, nH, c5, c6, and back to c3. So positions c3 to c6 and back. But then the original substituent is c2 connected to n and then the ring. So the substituent is a bicyclic group? Or maybe a fused ring.\n\nAlternatively, the substituent is a pyrazole ring fused with another ring. Wait, the substituent in A is -c2nc3cc[nH]cc3n2. Let's see: starting with c2 connected to n (c2n...), then c3. Then cc[nH]cc3. So c3 is part of a ring: c3, c, c, [nH], c, c3. That's a five-membered ring: c3, c4, c5, nH, c6, back to c3. Then the n2 at the end connects back to c2. So the substituent is a bicyclic system where c2 is connected to n, which is part of a five-membered ring (c3 to c6), and then another nitrogen (n2) connecting back to c2. So that forms a fused ring system. Maybe it's a imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine or similar? Not sure, but the key is to see if the two SMILES strings represent the same structure.\n\nMolecule B: starts with a five-membered ring (c1[nH]ccc2), then connected to another part. The hyphen after c2 leads to -c1nc(n2)-. Wait, the c1 here would be a new ring closure. Then there's a benzene ring with fluorine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two SMILES strings are just different representations of the same molecule. For example, the order of ring numbering might be different, but the actual structure is the same.\n\nAnother approach: convert both SMILES to canonical forms using a tool like RDKit. If their canonical SMILES match, then they are the same. Since I can't run code here, I'll have to reason it out.\n\nIn Molecule A, the benzene ring has a fluorine and a substituent. The substituent is a bicyclic group with two nitrogens. In Molecule B, the structure starts with a five-membered ring with a NH group, connected to another nitrogen-containing ring, and then a benzene with fluorine.\n\nWait, perhaps they are the same but written with different ring numbering. For example, the bicyclic group in A could be the same as the one in B but written in a different order.\n\nLet me try to see if the substituent in A and the substituent in B are the same.\n\nIn A: substituent is -c2nc3cc[nH]cc3n2. So the bicyclic system is a five-membered ring fused with another ring. Let's see:\n\nThe c2 is connected to n (position 1), then c3 (position 2). The five-membered ring is c3, c4, c5 (with NH), c6, c7 (back to c3). Wait, maybe it's a six-membered ring? No, the closure is at c3. So the ring is c3, c4, c5, NH, c6, c3. That's six members? Wait, no, that would be five: c3 to c4 to c5 to NH to c6 to c3? That's five atoms: c3, c4, c5, NH, c6 (ring closure back to c3). Wait, that's five members. Then the c2 is connected to n, which is connected to c3. Then the n2 connects back to c2. So the bicyclic system would have two rings: one between c2, n, c3, and then the five-membered ring. Wait, perhaps it's a fused ring system where c2 is part of both rings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent in A is a 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine or similar.\n\nIn Molecule B, the substituent starts with a five-membered ring (c1[nH]ccc2), which is connected to another ring. The part after the hyphen is -c1nc(n2)-. So the c1 here is part of a new ring? Let me try to imagine the structure. The first ring is five-membered with NH. Then connected to a nitrogen-containing ring. The benzene is attached via a single bond.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the core structure in both molecules is a benzene ring with fluorine and a bicyclic amine substituent. The key is whether the bicyclic groups are the same but written in different SMILES notation.\n\nAnother way: count the number of rings and atoms. Both molecules have a benzene ring (6 carbons), fluorine, and a bicyclic substituent. The substituent in A has two nitrogens (the n and n2 in the substituent), and the substituent in B also has two nitrogens (the [nH] and the two n's in the middle part). So the count of atoms might be the same.\n\nIf I can mentally rotate the substituent and see if it's the same structure, then they are the same. For example, the substituent in A could be a pyrrolopyrimidine or similar, and the substituent in B is the same but written with different ring closures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent in A is a 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine, and in B it's the same but written with different starting points.\n\nSince SMILES can represent the same molecule in different ways depending on the order of atoms and ring numbering, the key is to see if the connectivity is identical.\n\nIn Molecule A's substituent: the bicyclic system has a bridge between the two nitrogens. In Molecule B's substituent: the first ring has NH, then connected to another ring with two nitrogens. If these are the same connectivity, then the molecules are the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent in A is a 5-membered ring fused to a 6-membered ring, and in B it's the same but written with a different starting point.\n\nGiven that both have a benzene ring with fluorine and a bicyclic substituent containing two nitrogens and a NH group, it's possible they are the same.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry in the substituent. If the substituent can be rotated or mirrored and still have the same structure, then the SMILES could differ but represent the same molecule.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the two molecules are actually the same, just represented with different SMILES strings due to different ring numbering or atom ordering. Therefore, the output should be \"Yes\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to know if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. First, I need to recall how SMILES notation works. SMILES strings can vary in the order of atoms and branches, but they still describe the same molecule if the connectivity and stereochemistry are the same.\n\nLooking at Molecule A: COC(=O)CSc1nc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c(-c2ccncc2)[nH]1. Let's break this down. The main structure seems to be a thiophene ring (since there's S connected to C). The COC(=O) part is an ester group (OCH3 connected to a carbonyl). Then there's a sulfur (S) connected to a carbon, which is part of a ring (the 'c1...' part). The ring has substituents: one is a phenyl ring with fluorine (-c2ccc(F)cc2), another is a pyridine ring (-c2ccncc2), and a [nH] group.\n\nNow, Molecule B: c1(-c2ccncc2)c(nc([nH]1)SCC(OC)=O)-c1ccc(cc1)F. Let's parse this. The main ring here starts with c1, which is connected to a pyridine group (-c2ccncc2). The next part is c(nc([nH]1)SCC(OC)=O, which seems like a sulfur connected to a CC(OC)=O group. Then there's a substituent -c1ccc(cc1)F, which is another fluorine-substituted benzene ring.\n\nWait, the main difference is the order of substituents and how the rings are connected. In SMILES, the order can change as long as the actual structure remains the same. Let me try to map the substituents.\n\nIn Molecule A, the main ring (the 'c1' ring) has substituents at positions where the nitrogen is part of the ring. The substituents are the fluorine benzene and the pyridine. In Molecule B, the main ring starts with the pyridine substituent, then the NC part connected to the sulfur, and the fluorine benzene. \n\nLet me visualize both structures. Both have a central ring (possibly a thiazole or similar heterocycle) with substituents. The key is whether the connectivity is the same. For example, the ester group (COC=O) is attached via the sulfur in both cases. The sulfur is part of a chain connecting to the ring. \n\nWait, in Molecule A, the sulfur is part of the chain: COC(=O)C-S-c1... So the ester is attached via a methylene (C) to the sulfur, which connects to the ring. In Molecule B, the sulfur is part of the substituent on the ring: nc([nH]1)SCC(OC)=O. So here, the sulfur is connected to a CC(OC)=O group. That would be S-C-C(O)OC. Wait, that's the same as in Molecule A: COC(=O) is O=C-O-C, connected to a CH2-S (since it's C-S, with the COC(=O) attached to the C). So in A, the ester is O=C-O-C (from COC(=O)) connected to a CH2-S (since it's C-S: the 'C' in CSc1... is the CH2 between S and the ester). \n\nIn Molecule B, the sulfur is connected to a CC(OC)=O. That would be S-C-C(=O)-O-C. Wait, that's the same as in A. Because in B, SCC(OC)=O is S-C-C(=O)-O-C. But in A, it's COC(=O)-C-S. So the ester group in A is O-C-O-C(=O)-C-S, while in B, it's S-C-C(=O)-O-C. Wait, that's the same. Because the ester group is O=C-O- connected to a CH2-S. So the ester is O=C-O-CH2-S. In A, the SMILES is COC(=O)CSc..., which translates to O=C(OCH3)-CH2-S. In B, the SMILES has SCC(OC)=O, which is S-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3. Which is the same group, just written in reverse. Because in SMILES, the order of writing doesn't change the structure as long as the connectivity is the same. So the ester group in both cases is OCH3 connected via the carbonyl to the CH2-S.\n\nThen, looking at the rings. The main ring in A is the 'c1nc(...)[nH]1' part. So it's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. The substituents are attached to the carbons adjacent to the nitrogens. In A, the substituents are -c2ccc(F)cc2 (fluorobenzene) and -c2ccncc2 (pyridine). \n\nIn B, the main ring is c1(...)c(...)c(...) etc. Let's parse the ring: c1(-c2ccncc2)c(nc([nH]1)SCC(OC)=O)-c1ccc(cc1)F. Wait, the indices here might be confusing. Let me reindex to avoid confusion. The main ring is ring 1: c1(-c2ccncc2)c(nc([nH]1)... So the first carbon in the ring (position 1) is connected to the pyridine substituent (-c2ccncc2). Then, the next carbon (position 2) has a substituent which is nc([nH]1)SCC... So that's a nitrogen connected to another carbon, which is part of a ring closure (the [nH]1 indicates that the nitrogen is part of the same ring 1). So the ring has a nitrogen at position 3 (assuming the ring is five-membered). The substituent at position 2 is a group that includes the sulfur and ester. Then, the next substituent is -c1ccc(cc1)F, which is another fluorobenzene.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to draw both structures mentally. Both molecules have a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. In Molecule A, the ring is written as Sc1nc(...)[nH]1. Wait, no\u2014the S is part of the chain, not the ring. The ring starts after the S: c1nc(...)[nH]1. So the ring is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. One is a nitrile (nc), but that's not correct. Wait, the SMILES for the ring in A is c1nc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c(-c2ccncc2)[nH]1. So the ring is five-membered: positions 1 (carbon), 2 (nitrogen), 3 (carbon with substituent), 4 (carbon with substituent), 5 (NH). So the ring is C-N-C-C-NH. The substituents on carbons 3 and 4 are the fluorobenzene and pyridine groups.\n\nIn Molecule B, the ring is c1(-c2ccncc2)c(nc([nH]1)SCC(OC)=O)-c1ccc(cc1)F. Let's parse this again. The main ring is c1(...)c(...)c(...). Wait, maybe it's a five-membered ring. Let's see: the first atom is c1 connected to the pyridine. Then, the next atom is c(nc([nH]1)... So that's a carbon connected to a nitrogen (from the nc group), which connects back to the NH in the ring (since [nH]1 refers back to ring 1). So the ring would be positions 1 (C connected to pyridine), 2 (C connected to NC), 3 (N connected to C), 4 (C connected to fluorobenzene), and 5 (NH). But I might be mixing up the positions. Alternatively, the ring could have the substituents in different positions.\n\nThe key is whether the substituents are attached to the same positions in both molecules. In A, the fluorobenzene is attached to the nitrogen at position 2 (nc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)), and the pyridine is attached to the carbon at position 4 (c(-c2ccncc2)). In B, the fluorobenzene is attached to a carbon (-c1ccc(cc1)F), and the pyridine is attached to another carbon (-c2ccncc2). The arrangement might be the same but written in a different order.\n\nAlternatively, the SMILES notation for B could be a different ordering of the substituents, but the actual connectivity is the same. For example, in SMILES, the order of branches can vary, but the structure remains the same. So if the fluorobenzene and pyridine are attached to the same positions in the ring, and the ester group is connected via sulfur in the same way, then they are the same.\n\nAnother point to check is the direction of the ring numbering. SMILES can start the ring at any atom, which can change the order of the substituents but still represent the same molecule. For instance, if the ring in A is written starting at a different position compared to B, but the substituents are in the same relative positions, they would be the same.\n\nLet me try to compare the substituents. Both have:\n\n- A fluorobenzene group (-c2ccc(F)cc2 in A, -c1ccc(cc1)F in B). These are equivalent, just written with different indices.\n\n- A pyridine group (-c2ccncc2 in both cases).\n\n- An ester group connected via a sulfur (COC(=O)CSc... in A vs SCC(OC)=O in B).\n\n- The central ring with two nitrogens and a sulfur in the substituent chain.\n\nThe main concern is whether the substituents are on the same positions in the central ring. Let's map the central rings:\n\nIn A: the ring is c1nc(...)c(...)[nH]1. So the ring atoms are C, N, C, C, NH. The substituents are on the second and third carbons (since the first is part of the ring start). Wait, SMILES notation builds the ring step by step. Let me try to write out the ring structure:\n\nStart with the first carbon (c1), then a nitrogen (n), then a carbon (c) with substituent (-c2ccc(F)cc2), then another carbon (c) with substituent (-c2ccncc2), then a nitrogen with a hydrogen ([nH]1) closing the ring. So the ring is a five-membered ring: C1 connected to N, then C (with fluorobenzene), then C (with pyridine), then NH, back to C1. So the substituents are on the second and third atoms of the ring (positions 2 and 3 if we count starting from the first carbon as position 1).\n\nIn B: the ring is written as c1(-c2ccncc2)c(nc([nH]1)...) which starts with a carbon (c1) connected to the pyridine substituent. Then the next carbon (position 2) has substituents: a nitrogen connected to another carbon (nc([nH]1)), which is part of the ring closure. Then, after that, there's the sulfur-ester chain and the fluorobenzene substituent.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the SMILES for B is a different way of writing the same ring. For example, starting the ring at the carbon attached to the pyridine, then proceeding to the nitrogen, etc. If the substituents are in the same positions relative to each other, then the molecules are the same.\n\nAnother approach is to canonicalize both SMILES strings. If they canonicalize to the same string, then they are the same molecule. However, I don't have a tool here, but I can try to reason based on SMILES rules.\n\nThe ester groups are the same, just written in reverse. The sulfur is connected to CH2 in both cases (CSc1 in A, SCC in B). Wait, in A it's CSc1: the sulfur is connected to the carbon from the ester (COC(=O)C-S), so that's CH2-S. In B, SCC(OC)=O: S-C-C(=O)-O-C. So the sulfur is connected to a CH2 (the two Cs), making it S-CH2-C(=O)-OCH3. Which is the same as in A: OCH3-C(=O)-CH2-S.\n\nSo the ester and sulfur chain are the same.\n\nNow, the central ring. In A: the ring has substituents on the nitrogen (nc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)) and on the next carbon (c(-c2ccncc2)). In B, the substituents are on the first carbon (c1(-c2ccncc2)) and on the second carbon (c(nc...)-c...F). \n\nWait, if in A the substituents are on the nitrogen and adjacent carbon, and in B they are on two adjacent carbons, that might be a difference. But wait, in SMILES, the nitrogen is part of the ring. So in A, the ring structure is C-N-C-C-NH. The substituents are on the second and third atoms (the N and the following C). Wait, no: the substituents are on the carbons following the N. Let me clarify:\n\nIn A's SMILES: COC(=O)CSc1nc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c(-c2ccncc2)[nH]1.\n\nBreaking down the ring:\n\n- Start with c1 (carbon 1)\n- Then n (nitrogen 2)\n- Then c (carbon 3) with substituent -c2ccc(F)cc2 (fluorobenzene)\n- Then c (carbon 4) with substituent -c2ccncc2 (pyridine)\n- Then [nH]1 (nitrogen 5 with a hydrogen, closing the ring back to carbon 1)\n\nSo the ring is C1-N2-C3-C4-N5, with C1 connected to N5. The substituents are on C3 (fluorobenzene) and C4 (pyridine). \n\nIn B's SMILES: c1(-c2ccncc2)c(nc([nH]1)SCC(OC)=O)-c1ccc(cc1)F.\n\nBreaking down the ring:\n\n- Start with c1 (carbon 1) connected to pyridine (-c2ccncc2)\n- Next is c (carbon 2) with substituents: n (nitrogen 3) connected to c (carbon 4), which has substituents nc([nH]1) (this part is a bit confusing)\n- The nc([nH]1) would be nitrogen 3 connected to carbon 4, which is part of the ring closure ([nH]1 refers to nitrogen 5 in ring 1)\n- Then the substituent -c1ccc(cc1)F (fluorobenzene)\n\nThis is quite complex. Let me try to map it step by step.\n\nIn B's ring:\n\n- c1 is the first carbon (position 1), connected to the pyridine.\n- The next atom is carbon 2, which has substituents: a nitrogen (n) connected to a carbon (c) which is part of the nc group. The nc group connects to [nH]1, which is nitrogen 5 in the ring.\n- Then, carbon 2 also has a substituent -c1ccc(cc1)F (fluorobenzene).\n\nWait, perhaps the ring in B is structured as follows:\n\nRing positions:\n\n1: C connected to pyridine\n2: C connected to nitrogen (n) and fluorobenzene\n3: N connected to carbon (from nc)\n4: C connected to sulfur-ester chain\n5: NH (from [nH]1)\n\nBut this is getting too unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the rings are the same but written in a different order. Since SMILES can start numbering the ring from any atom, the order of substituents can vary, but the molecule remains the same.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that SMILES strings can be canonicalized, and if the canonical versions match, they are the same. But without doing that, I need to determine if the connectivity is identical.\n\nAssuming that the substituents are on the same positions in the ring, just written in a different order, and the ester chain is the same, the answer would be yes. However, if the substituents are on different positions (e.g., adjacent vs. opposite), then they are different.\n\nWait, in A's ring, the substituents are on C3 and C4 (fluorobenzene and pyridine), which are adjacent. In B's ring, if the substituents are on C1 (pyridine) and C2 (fluorobenzene), then they would also be adjacent. So the relative positions would be the same: substituents on adjacent carbons. Therefore, the molecules would be the same.\n\nBut wait, in A's ring, the substituents are on C3 and C4 (positions 3 and 4 of the ring), which are adjacent. In B's SMILES, the substituents are on C1 (pyridine) and C2 (fluorobenzene), which are adjacent. If the ring is five-membered, then positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the substituents are on adjacent positions in both cases. Therefore, the molecules are the same, just written with different starting points in the ring.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Yes\".",

Let me start by looking at both of them carefully.\n\nMolecule A: Cc1oc(=O)oc1COC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1ccc(C(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)cc1\n\nMolecule B: c1c(ccc(c1)Cl)C(=O)c1ccc(OC(C(OCc2c(C)oc(o2)=O)=O)(C)C)cc1\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part. SMILES strings can sometimes look complicated, but breaking them into rings and substituents helps. Let's parse Molecule A.\n\nStarting with A: The first part is Cc1oc(=O)oc1. That's a cyclic ester, maybe a substituted oxolane? The 'oc(=O)o' suggests a cyclic carbonate or something similar. The 'c1' indicates a benzene ring here. Wait, no, the numbers might be ring closures. Let me check. The 'c1oc(=O)oc1' part: the 'c1' starts a ring, then o (oxygen), then c(=O) (carbonyl), then o (another oxygen), then back to c1 to close the ring. So that's a five-membered ring: O-C-O-C(=O)-O, but wait, that's four atoms. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's see: the first atom is c1 (carbon), then o (oxygen), then c(=O) (carbonyl), then o (another oxygen), then c1 again. So the ring is five-membered: carbon (from c1), oxygen, carbonyl carbon, oxygen, and then back to the first carbon? Wait, no, that would make a five-membered ring? Let me draw it mentally. The SMILES notation is C (from Cc1...), then the ring starts with c1. So maybe it's a five-membered ring with two oxygens and a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe a cyclic carbonate? For example, like an oxetane carbonate or something. Then after that, COC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1ccc(...) etc.\n\nNow, looking at Molecule B: c1c(ccc(c1)Cl)C(=O)c1ccc(OC(...))cc1. Let's parse that. Starting with the benzene ring: c1c(...)C(=O)... So the first benzene ring has a Cl substituent. Then a carbonyl connected to another benzene ring which has an OC(...) group. The OC part in B is OC(C(OCc2c(C)oc(o2)=O)=O)(C)C). That's a bit complex. Let's break it down. The OC(...) is an oxygen connected to a carbon, which is connected to another group: C(OCc2...)=O. Then the rest.\n\nNow, the key is to see if the connectivity and substituents are the same in both molecules. Let's compare the substituents and their positions.\n\nIn Molecule A, after the initial cyclic part (Cc1oc(=O)oc1), there's COC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1ccc(...). The COC(=O) is an ester group: O-C-O-C(=O). Then C(C)(C) is a tert-butyl group. So the ester is connected to a tert-butyl and then an oxygen connected to a benzene ring (Oc1ccc...).\n\nIn Molecule B, the substituent on the benzene ring is OC(C(OCc2c(C)oc(o2)=O)=O)(C)C). Let's parse that. The oxygen is connected to a carbon that has two substituents: one is C(OCc2...)=O, and the other two are C(C)(C). Wait, the structure is OC(C(...)(C)C). So that's a central carbon connected to an oxygen, a group (C(...)), and two methyl groups (C). So the central carbon is connected to O, a substituent (which is C(OCc2...)=O), and two methyl groups. That substituent C(OCc2...)=O is a carbonyl group attached to a carbon that's also connected to an OCc2... group. The OCc2 part is an oxygen connected to a CH2 group (since c2 is a ring, but in this case, the c2 is part of a ring: c2c(C)oc(o2)=O. Wait, the c2 part: c2c(C)oc(o2)=O. So the ring starts with c2, then another carbon (C), then o (oxygen), then c(o2)=O. So this is another five-membered ring? Let me see: c2 (carbon), then c(C) (another carbon with methyl group), then o (oxygen), then c(=O) (carbonyl), then back to c2. That's a five-membered ring: carbon (c2), carbon (with methyl), oxygen, carbonyl carbon, and back to c2. Wait, that's four atoms. No, maybe the ring closure is between c2 and the last c in oc(o2)=O. Let me write it step by step:\n\nc2c(C)oc(o2)=O. The c2 is the first atom. Then comes a carbon (with a methyl group), then oxygen, then a carbonyl carbon (c=O), which is connected back to c2 via o2. Wait, maybe the ring is c2-C(C)-O-C(=O)-O-? Hmm, perhaps a cyclic carbonate again. So the OCc2 part is O-CH2- connected to this cyclic carbonate ring.\n\nPutting it all together, the substituent in Molecule B is a tert-butyl group (from C(C)(C)) attached to a central carbon that's also connected to an ester group (the C(=O)O-) and another oxygen connected to a methyl-substituted cyclic carbonate.\n\nComparing to Molecule A, the substituent after the initial cyclic carbonate is COC(=O)C(C)(C)O..., which is an ester (COC(=O)) connected to a tert-butyl (C(C)(C)) and then an oxygen connected to the benzene ring. So in A, the ester is directly connected to the tert-butyl and then the oxygen. In B, the substituent is a more complex structure with the central carbon connected to the ester group, the cyclic carbonate via an ethyl group (OCc2...), and two methyl groups. Wait, maybe I need to check if the substituents are actually the same but written in different orders.\n\nSMILES can sometimes have different representations based on the order of substituents or ring numbering, but the actual structure remains the same. For example, different starting points in the ring can lead to different SMILES strings. So maybe the two molecules are the same but written with different SMILES notations.\n\nAnother approach is to convert both SMILES to their canonical forms using a tool like RDKit. Since I can't do that here, I'll have to compare manually.\n\nLet me try to map the substituents. In Molecule A, the benzene ring (from the end part) has O-C(=O)-tert-butyl-O- connected to a benzene ring which is substituted with a C(=O) connected to another benzene ring with Cl.\n\nIn Molecule B, the benzene ring starts with Cl on one ring, then C(=O) connected to another benzene ring with an O- substituent. The O- is connected to a carbon that has a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)), a carbonyl group (C(=O)), and another ester group connected to a cyclic carbonate (OCc2...).\n\nWait, in Molecule A, the substituent on the benzene ring is C(=O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2. So a ketone (C=O) connected to a benzene ring with Cl. In Molecule B, the substituent is C(=O)c1ccc(Cl)cc1. That seems the same. Then the other substituent in A is OC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1... Wait, no, the substituent in A is COC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1... which is an ester (O-C-O-C(=O)) connected to a tert-butyl (C(C)(C)) and then O connected to another benzene ring. In Molecule B, the substituent is OC(...) where ... is C(OCc2...)=O and C(C)(C). So perhaps the same groups but arranged differently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ester and the cyclic carbonate groups are part of the same substituent but written in a different order. For example, in A, the substituent is COC(=O)-tert-butyl-O-benzene. In B, the substituent is O-C(tert-butyl)-C(=O)-O-cyclic carbonate. Wait, perhaps they are the same but written in reverse. Let me think: in A, after the initial cyclic carbonate (Cc1oc(=O)oc1), there's COC(=O)C(C)(C)O... So that's a methyl group (from the C in Cc1), then the cyclic carbonate, then a CH2-O-C(=O)-C(C)(C)-O-benzene. In B, the substituent is O-C(C(=O)-O-cyclic carbonate)-C(C)(C). Hmm, maybe the ester groups are in a different order. Let me try to write out the structures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two SMILES strings are different representations of the same molecule. For example, the ester groups could be written starting from different directions. Let's see: in A, the ester is COC(=O)C(C)(C)O..., which is O-C-O-C(=O)-C(C)(C)-O... In B, the substituent is OC(C(OCc2...)=O)(C)C). So O-C(-C(OCc2...)=O)(C)(C). That's a central carbon attached to O, two methyl groups, and a carbonyl group connected to an OCc2... group. Wait, this central carbon would have four bonds: O, two C (methyl), and C(=O)... So that's a tertiary carbon attached to an oxygen, two methyl groups, and a carbonyl group. But in A, the ester is connected to a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)), which is a central carbon attached to three methyl groups and the ester oxygen. Wait, no: C(C)(C) is two methyl groups and the central carbon is connected to another group. Wait, the structure in A is C(C)(C)O..., so that's a tert-butyl-O group. Wait, no: C(C)(C) is a central carbon connected to two methyl groups and another group. Wait, the structure is C(C)(C)Oc1..., so the oxygen is attached to the central carbon of the tert-butyl group. Wait, no: the SMILES is C(C)(C)Oc1... So that's a carbon connected to two methyl groups and an oxygen. Wait, the actual structure is C(C)(C)-O-... So that's a tert-butoxy group (O-C(C)(C)C). But in B, the substituent is O-C(C(=O)...)(C)C. So that's O connected to a carbon that has two methyl groups (C(C)), and another group which is C(=O)... So that's a carbon attached to O, two methyl groups, and a carbonyl group. That's different from A's structure, where the O is attached to a tert-butyl group (three methyl groups on the adjacent carbon). So in A, the substituent is O-C(C)(C)C (tert-butoxy), while in B, the substituent is O-C(C(=O)...)(C)C (a carbon attached to O, two methyl groups, and a carbonyl group). These are different substituents, so the molecules would be different.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify the substituents in both cases.\n\nIn Molecule A: After the cyclic carbonate part (Cc1oc(=O)oc1), there's COC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1ccc...\n\nBreaking down COC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1...:\n\n- COC(=O): This is an ester group, where O is connected to C (from COC), which is connected to O=C.\n\n- C(C)(C)Oc1: The C here is the central carbon connected to two methyl groups (C(C)(C)), and then O connected to the benzene ring (Oc1...). So the structure is O-C(=O)-O-C(C)(C)-O-benzene? Wait, no. Wait, the SMILES is COC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1... So the sequence is C-O-C(=O)-C(C)(C)-O-c1... So the central part is O-C(=O)-C(C)(C)-O-. So that's a chain: oxygen (from ester) connected to carbonyl carbon, which is connected to a carbon with two methyl groups, then another oxygen connected to the benzene ring. Wait, but C(C)(C) is a carbon attached to two methyl groups and the next group. So the structure would be:\n\nCH3-O-C(=O)-C(CH3)2-O-benzene. Wait, but C(C)(C) is a carbon connected to two C groups (methyl), so that's C(CH3)2. But wait, in SMILES, C(C)(C) would be a central carbon with three substituents: two methyl groups and the next group. Wait, no: each C in C(C)(C) refers to a methyl group. Wait, no: in SMILES, C(C)(C)O would be a central carbon connected to two methyl groups (from C(C)), another methyl (from the third C?), and then O. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the SMILES notation here. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe part in A: COC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1...\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- C (from COC): this is the carbon in the ester group (O-C-O-).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the structure step by step.\n\nCOC(=O)C(C)(C)Oc1...\n\n- The first C is part of the ester: the ester group is O-C-O-C(=O).\n\nWait, no. The SMILES is COC(=O)... So that's C-O-C(=O)-... So the ester is O-C-O-C(=O)-... Then comes C(C)(C). So the carbonyl carbon (from the ester) is connected to a carbon that has two methyl groups (C(C)(C)). Then this carbon is connected to an oxygen (Oc1...). So the structure would be:\n\nO-C(=O)-C(C)(C)-O-benzene.\n\nWait, but that would be a ketone (C(=O)) connected to a carbon with two methyl groups and an oxygen. That doesn't make sense because the carbonyl is already double-bonded. Wait, no, the ester is O-C(=O)-O-R. Wait, no: the ester group is usually R-O-C(=O)-O-R'. But in this case, the SMILES is COC(=O)C(C)(C)O... So maybe it's O-C(=O)-C(C)(C)-O... which would be an anhydride? Or a carbonate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is O-C(=O)-C(C)(C)-O-... which is a carbonate group? Wait, a carbonate is O-C(=O)-O-. But here it's O-C(=O)-C(...)-O... Hmm, maybe that's a different functional group.\n\nIn Molecule B, the substituent is OC(C(OCc2...)=O)(C)C). Let's parse this:\n\n- O connected to C.\n\n- The C is connected to three groups: C(OCc2...)=O, and two C (methyl groups).\n\nSo the substituent is O-C(-C(=O)-O-...)(C)(C). That's a central carbon attached to O, two methyl groups, and a carbonyl group that's connected to an oxygen and another group (OCc2...).\n\nComparing to A's substituent: O-C(=O)-C(C)(C)-O-... In A, the carbonyl is part of an ester (O-C(=O)-O-R), but here in B, the substituent seems to be a different arrangement. It looks like B's substituent is a carbonate group (O-C(=O)-O-) connected to a cyclic structure, while A's substituent is a different arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing some ring numbering differences. For example, the cyclic parts in A and B might be the same but written in different orders. Let me check the cyclic parts.\n\nIn Molecule A: The first part is Cc1oc(=O)oc1. So the ring closure is between the first c1 and the last c1. The atoms in the ring are c1 (carbon with methyl), o, c(=O), o, c1. Wait, that's a five-membered ring? Because c1 starts the ring, then o, then c(=O), then o, then back to c1. So the ring is five atoms: carbon, oxygen, carbonyl carbon, oxygen, and back to the starting carbon. That would make a five-membered ring: O-C-O-C(=O)-O? No, wait, the ring would be c1 (C), o, c(=O) (C), o, c1 (C). Wait, that's four atoms? Because the ring starts at c1 (C), then o (O), then c(=O) (C), then o (O), then back to c1 (C). So the ring has four members: C-O-C-O-C? No, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. The SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to denote the closure. So c1...c1 means that the first c1 and the last c1 are connected. Let's write the sequence:\n\nCc1oc(=O)oc1...\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- C (methyl) connected to c1 (ring atom).\n\n- c1 is connected to o (oxygen), then c(=O) (carbonyl carbon), then o (oxygen), then c1 (closing the ring).\n\nSo the ring is: c1 (C) - o (O) - c(=O) (C) - o (O) - c1 (C). Wait, that's four members: C-O-C-O-C, but the last C is the same as the first, making a five-membered ring? No, because the first atom is c1 (C), then O, then C(=O), then O, then back to c1 (C). So the ring is five-membered: C-O-C(=O)-O-C. That's a cyclic carbonate, right? A five-membered cyclic carbonate (like ethylene carbonate but with a methyl group). So the ring is a cyclic carbonate with a methyl substituent on one of the carbons.\n\nIn Molecule B, the cyclic part is c2c(C)oc(o2)=O. Let's parse that:\n\n- c2 (ring start) connected to c(C) (carbon with methyl), then o (oxygen), then c(=O) (carbonyl), and then o2 (ring closure back to c2). So the ring is c2 (C) - C(C) (methyl) - O - C(=O) - c2 (C). That's a five-membered ring? Wait, c2 is connected to C(C), then O, then C(=O), then back to c2. So the ring is C-C(C)-O-C(=O)-C. That's five members. So it's also a cyclic carbonate, but with a methyl group on the adjacent carbon to the oxygen. So in Molecule B, the cyclic carbonate has the methyl on the carbon next to the oxygen, while in Molecule A, the methyl is on the same carbon as the starting point. Wait, but in A, the methyl is on the c1 (the first carbon of the ring), while in B, the methyl is on the c2 (the second carbon of the ring). Depending on the numbering, these could be the same if the ring is numbered differently. However, cyclic structures in SMILES depend on the starting point and direction. If the rings are identical but numbered differently, they would still be the same molecule. For example, if the ring in A is methyl at position 1, and in B it's methyl at position 2, but the ring is the same otherwise, then they could be the same if the numbering is different. However, cyclic carbonates have specific structures. Let's imagine the ring in A: methyl is on one carbon, followed by two oxygens and a carbonyl. Wait, no, in A's ring: C (methyl) - O - C(=O) - O - C (back to start). So the ring is C-O-C(=O)-O-C (with the methyl on the first C). In B's ring: C (no methyl here) - C(C) (methyl) - O - C(=O) - C (back to start). So the methyl is on the second carbon. These are different structures because the position of the methyl group differs. Therefore, the cyclic carbonates in A and B are different, which would make the entire molecules different.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the substituents on the benzene rings: in A, the benzene ring is connected via O to the C(C)(C) group (tert-butyl), which is part of an ester. In B, the benzene ring is connected via O to a central carbon that has a carbonyl group connected to another cyclic carbonate and two methyl groups. These substituents are different, so the molecules are not the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"No\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Molecule A is COc1cc2ncnc(NC(C)C)c2cc1OC, and Molecule B is c12cc(OC)c(OC)cc2c(NC(C)C)ncn1.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse each SMILES to understand their structures. SMILES notation can sometimes be tricky because of the ring numbering and branching. Let me start with Molecule A.\n\nMolecule A: COc1cc2ncnc(NC(C)C)c2cc1OC. Breaking this down. The \"COc1\" part is a methoxy group attached to a benzene ring (since 'c' denotes aromatic carbon). The ring starts at position 1. Then, the sequence cc2ncnc... So, after the first two carbons (positions 1 and 2?), there's a ring closure with '2', creating a second ring? Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let me draw this mentally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that forms another ring. The part after COc1 is cc2ncnc(...)c2cc1OC. So, the benzene ring (positions 1-6) has a methoxy group (OCH3) at position 1. Then, moving around the ring, there's a connection to another ring via the '2' closure. The second ring would be the ncnc part. Wait, n is an aromatic nitrogen, right? So maybe the second ring is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. Let's think: ncnc. So positions 2,3,4,5,6? Not sure. Maybe it's a fused ring system, like a benzimidazole or something similar.\n\nNow, looking at Molecule B: c12cc(OC)c(OC)cc2c(NC(C)C)ncn1. This starts with c12, which indicates a fused ring system where atom 1 is part of both rings. The first ring (ring 1) and ring 2. The structure then is cc(OC)c(OC)cc2... So, positions around the first ring have two OCH3 groups? Then moving to the second ring, which has the NC(C)C group and the ncn part.\n\nWait, maybe both molecules are similar but differ in the positions of substituents. Let me try to compare substituents. Molecule A has two OCH3 groups. The first is at position 1 (COc1...), and another OC at the end (cc1OC), so perhaps the benzene ring has two OCH3 groups. Then, there's a fused ring with the NC(C)C group attached. In Molecule B, the OCH3 groups are on the first ring as well: c12cc(OC)c(OC)cc2... So positions 3 and 4 (assuming the numbering starts at 1 and 2 as the fusion points) have the OCH3 groups. The NC(C)C group is attached to the second ring.\n\nSo the key is whether the substituents are in equivalent positions when considering the fused rings. SMILES can sometimes represent the same molecule with different numbering, especially in rings. For example, if the rings are fused in the same way but the starting point is different, the SMILES might look different but actually be the same.\n\nAnother approach is to convert both SMILES to their canonical forms using a tool like RDKit. Canonical SMILES standardize the representation, so if they are the same molecule, their canonical SMILES would be identical. However, since I don't have access to that here, I need to analyze manually.\n\nLooking at the substituents: both molecules have two OCH3 groups, a NC(C)C (isopropylamino) group, and a fused ring system with two nitrogens. The question is the arrangement of these groups.\n\nIn Molecule A: the OCH3 groups are on the benzene ring (positions 1 and, perhaps, another position when considering the ring closures). The fused ring would have the NC(C)C attached. In Molecule B, the OCH3 groups are on the benzene ring (positions 3 and 4?), and the NC(C)C is on the fused ring.\n\nWait, but SMILES notation for rings can sometimes have different starting points. For example, in a benzene ring, the order in which the atoms are written can rotate, leading to different SMILES strings but the same structure. However, fused rings can complicate this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two SMILES are actually the same molecule but written with different ring numbering. Let me try to map the atoms.\n\nIn Molecule A, the benzene ring is defined by the atoms starting at 1 (COc1...). The 'c1' is the first atom, which has a methoxy group. Then, the ring proceeds through cc2... The 'c2' would be a connection to the second ring. The second ring is ncnc(NC...) which suggests a five-membered ring with nitrogens. Then, back to the benzene ring with c2cc1OC. So the benzene ring has OCH3 at positions 1 and... where? The OC at the end is attached to the benzene ring's atom 1 again? Wait, maybe the benzene ring is positions 1,2,3,4,5,6, and the fused ring is attached at positions 2 and 3 (or another pair). The two OCH3 groups are at positions 1 and 6, perhaps.\n\nIn Molecule B, the fused rings start with c12, so atom 1 is part of both rings. The first ring (ring 1) has atoms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and the second ring (ring 2) shares atoms 1 and 2. Then, the substituents are OCH3 at positions 3 and 4 (cc(OC)c(OC)), then back to ring 2 with cc2... which connects to atom 2 of the second ring. The second ring has NC(C)C and the ncn part.\n\nHmm. This is getting a bit complicated. Maybe the key is to see if the substituents are on equivalent positions when considering the fused rings. Alternatively, perhaps the molecules are enantiomers or positional isomers.\n\nAnother angle: count the number of each substituent. Both have two OCH3, one NC(C)C, and the fused rings with two nitrogens. So the count matches. Now, the question is arrangement.\n\nIf the OCH3 groups are para to each other in one and meta in the other, they'd be different. But in fused systems, the positions depend on the fusion points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are the same. For example, if the two OCH3 groups are adjacent in one and in the other, but due to the fused ring system's symmetry, they are actually the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES are written in different orders but represent the same structure. For example, in Molecule A, the OCH3 groups are on positions 1 and 6 of the benzene ring, and in Molecule B, on positions 3 and 4. But if the benzene ring is part of a fused system, the numbering could be rotated, making them equivalent.\n\nWait, let's imagine the fused ring system. Suppose it's a benzene ring fused to a five-membered ring (like a pyrazole or imidazole). The positions of the substituents on the benzene ring relative to the fused ring would determine if they're the same.\n\nIf in Molecule A, the two OCH3 groups are on adjacent carbons of the benzene ring, and in Molecule B, they're on adjacent carbons but shifted due to different numbering, they could be the same. For example, in a naphthalene-like system, positions 1 and 2 vs. 2 and 3 would be different, but in a fused system with a smaller ring, maybe the positions are equivalent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two OCH3 groups are ortho to each other in both cases. Let me try to sketch mentally:\n\nMolecule A: benzene ring with OCH3 at positions 1 and 4 (if the benzene is numbered such that the fused ring is between positions 2 and 3). Then the fused five-membered ring has the NC(C)C group.\n\nMolecule B: benzene ring with OCH3 at positions 3 and 4 (if the fused ring is between positions 1 and 2). Then, the numbering is different but the actual positions relative to the fused ring are the same. That would mean the molecules are identical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are different representations of the same structure due to different ring numbering. For example, in SMILES, the order in which ring closures are specified can change the string, but the structure remains the same.\n\nAnother way to check is to look for symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that swaps the positions of the OCH3 groups, then different numbering would still result in the same structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two SMILES are actually the same when canonicalized. For example, using RDKit's canonicalization, both would generate the same SMILES string. Since I can't do that here, I need to infer.\n\nGiven that both have two OCH3, a NC(C)C, and fused rings with nitrogens, it's possible they are the same. The difference in SMILES might just be due to different starting points in the ring numbering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are enantiomers, but since there's no chiral center indicated (no @@ or @ in SMILES), they might be the same.\n\nWait, looking at the nitrogens in the fused ring: in Molecule A, the nitrogens are in positions 2 and 4 of the five-membered ring (ncnc), while in Molecule B, they are in positions 5 and 3 (ncn1). But the arrangement could be the same if the rings are numbered differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fused rings are in different positions relative to the substituents, making them isomers.\n\nThis is quite tricky without visualizing. Another approach: compare the InChI keys. If they are the same, then the molecules are identical. But again, I can't compute that here.\n\nAlternatively, think about the valency and possible structures. Both have aromatic rings, so valency should be correct.\n\nWait, maybe in Molecule A, the benzene ring is connected to a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. The five-membered ring would have two adjacent nitrogens (n and c then n?), but that might not be possible. Wait, in SMILES, aromatic nitrogens are lowercase 'n'. So in Molecule A, the sequence is ncnc, which would be N-C-N-C in the ring. But a five-membered ring with two nitrogens adjacent is possible, like in imidazole, but imidazole has two nitrogens separated by a carbon. Wait, imidazole has nitrogens at positions 1 and 3. So maybe this is a similar structure.\n\nIn any case, the key is whether the substituents are placed in equivalent positions. If the OCH3 groups are in positions that are symmetrical in the fused ring system, then the two SMILES could be the same.\n\nAlternatively, if the order of the substituents around the benzene ring differs, but due to the fused ring's orientation, they are actually the same.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the best approach here is to conclude that the two SMILES represent the same molecule because the substituents are present in the same numbers and types, and the differences in SMILES notation are due to different ring numbering. Therefore, the answer is Yes.",

The molecules given are:\n\nMolecule A: O=C(C=Cc1ccco1)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O\nMolecule B: C(NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O)(=O)C(Cc1ccccc1)NC(=O)C=Cc1occc1\n\nFirst, I need to recall that SMILES strings can be written in different orders but still represent the same structure. The key is to parse each SMILES and see if the connectivity and stereochemistry are identical.\n\nStarting with Molecule A. Let's break it down. The main chain seems to be a central carbon connected to several groups. The SMILES starts with O=C, which is a carbonyl group. Then there's (C=Cc1ccco1), which is a propenyl group attached to a cyclopentene ring (wait, the ring is c1ccco1\u2014so that's a five-membered ring with one oxygen. Let's see: positions 1 is connected to the propenyl, then positions 2,3,4 are carbons, and position 5 is an oxygen. So that would be a furan ring? Wait, no. The SMILES is c1ccco1. So starting at the first carbon, then three carbons (c c c), then an oxygen (o), making a five-membered ring. So the oxygen is in position 4, making it a furan derivative. But wait, furan is O in position 1 and 2, but maybe this is a different substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydrofuran or something else. Wait, no, the SMILES is c1ccco1. So the ring is written as C1=C-C-O-C1? Let me count: the first atom is a carbon (from the c1), then next three are carbons (c c c), then an oxygen (o), and then back to the first. So the ring is five-membered with oxygen at position 4 (since the first atom is 1, then 2,3,4,5). So positions 1-2-3-4 (O)-5 (connecting back to 1). Wait, that's a five-membered ring: 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (O), 5 (C). So the ring would be like C-C-C-O-C connected in a ring. Wait, but the positions might be arranged such that the oxygen is adjacent to the propenyl group. The propenyl group is C=C attached to the first carbon of the ring.\n\nThen, after the initial O=C group, there's an NC(...) group. The N is connected to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is a carbonyl (O=C) attached to a propenyl-furan (or similar) group, then an amine (N) connected to a C(Cc1ccccc1) group. The Cc1ccccc1 is a benzyl group (since c1ccccc1 is benzene, attached to a CH2 group). So the NC(...) part is an N-linked to a carbon that has a benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1) and a carbonyl group (C(=O)...). Then another NC(...) with another benzyl group and a carbonyloxy group (C(=O)O). \n\nPutting this all together, Molecule A is a tripeptide-like structure. Let's see: O=C(...) is the first carbonyl, then N-C(...) is the first amino acid residue, then another N-C(...) as the second residue, and ending with C(=O)O which is a carboxylic acid. The substituents on the amines are benzyl groups (from Cc1ccccc1) and the first carbonyl is attached to a propenyl-furan group.\n\nNow looking at Molecule B: C(NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O)(=O)C(Cc1ccccc1)NC(=O)C=Cc1occc1\n\nBreaking this down. The central carbon is C(...)(=O)C(...)NC(=O)... So the central carbon has four groups: a NC(...) group, a carbonyl (=O), another C(...) group, and a NC(=O)... group.\n\nThe first group attached is NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O. That's an amine (N) connected to a carbon which has a benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1) and a carbonyloxy group (C(=O)O). Then the central carbon has a carbonyl (=O), then another C(Cc1ccccc1) group (another benzyl), then an NC(=O) group attached to a propenyl ring similar to Molecule A but the ring here is c1occc1. Wait, the ring in Molecule B's end is c1occc1. Let's parse that. The first atom is carbon (c1), then o (oxygen), then three carbons (c c c), then back to 1. So the ring is five-membered with oxygen at position 2. So the ring is C-O-C-C-C, forming a five-membered ring. The propenyl group here is C=C attached to the first carbon of this ring. \n\nComparing the rings in both molecules: Molecule A's ring is c1ccco1 (positions 1,2,3,4,5: C, C, C, O, C), while Molecule B's ring is c1occc1 (positions 1,2,3,4,5: C, O, C, C, C). So the oxygen positions are different. In Molecule A, the oxygen is at position 4 (if the ring is numbered starting from the propenyl attachment), while in Molecule B, the oxygen is at position 2. That would make them different rings. For example, in Molecule A, the ring is a substituted furan where the oxygen is adjacent to the propenyl group's attachment point? Wait, let me visualize:\n\nMolecule A's ring: the propenyl is attached to position 1 of the ring (since it's C=Cc1ccco1). The ring is 1 (attached to propenyl), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (C), 5 (O). Wait, no. Wait the SMILES notation is c1ccco1. The ring closure numbers are 1. So the order is: first atom (1) is a carbon connected to the propenyl (C=Cc1...), then next three are c c c (so atoms 2,3,4), then o (atom 5), and back to atom 1. So the ring is 1-2-3-4-5 (O)-1. So the oxygen is in position 5. Wait, but SMILES is a circular notation. So the actual arrangement might be different depending on how the SMILES is written. Alternatively, the ring could be written in a different order but represent the same structure. For example, if the ring in Molecule A is c1ccco1, then the oxygen is the fourth atom in the ring. If the ring in Molecule B is c1occc1, the oxygen is the second atom. Unless the rings are written in a way that they are actually the same but just rotated. But SMILES strings can sometimes represent the same ring with different starting points. Let's check if the two rings are actually the same.\n\nFor example, c1ccco1 can be written starting at the oxygen. Let's see: if the ring is O1C=CC=C1, but that's not the same. Alternatively, if the ring in A is a furan with substituents. Wait, a furan has four carbons and one oxygen. Wait, the rings here are five-membered. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the SMILES for the ring in A: c1ccco1. The 'c' denotes aromatic carbons. So the ring is five-membered: four carbons and one oxygen. So it's a furan-like ring but with four carbons and one oxygen. Wait, furan is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one oxygen. Wait, no: furan is O in a five-membered ring with four carbons. So yes, that's correct. So the ring in Molecule A is a furan ring where the oxygen is in position 4 (if we consider the propenyl attached to position 1). The ring in Molecule B is c1occc1, which is a five-membered ring where the oxygen is in position 2. So unless the rings are identical but written in reverse order, they might be different.\n\nBut wait, SMILES strings can be written starting from any atom. So the ring in A could be equivalent to the ring in B if the order is reversed. For example, c1ccco1 could be equivalent to c1occc1 if written in reverse. Let's see:\n\nFor example, consider the ring in A: c1-C-C-C-O- (then back to c1). If written in reverse, it would be O-C-C-C-C. But the SMILES string for the ring in B is c1-o-c-c-c- (then back to c1). So the order is different. Therefore, the rings are not the same; the oxygen is in a different position relative to the propenyl attachment. In Molecule A, the propenyl is attached to a carbon adjacent to two carbons and then the oxygen, whereas in Molecule B, the propenyl is attached to a carbon adjacent to an oxygen and then three carbons. Therefore, the rings are structural isomers and thus different.\n\nIf the rings are different, then the entire molecules are different. However, perhaps the rest of the structure is the same. Let's check the rest of the molecule.\n\nIn Molecule A, after the initial O=C(C=Cc1ccco1), the next part is NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O. So this is a sequence where the central part is N-C(...)-C(=O)-N-C(...)-C(=O)O.\n\nIn Molecule B, the structure is C(NC(...)C(=O)O)(=O)C(...)NC(=O)... So the central carbon has four groups: the NC(...) group, a carbonyl, another C(...) group, and an NC(=O) group.\n\nWait, perhaps the two molecules are just written in a different order. Let's try to map the groups.\n\nMolecule A: The main chain is O=C(...)-N(...)-C(=O)-N(...)-C(=O)O.\n\nMolecule B: The main chain might be different. The central carbon in B is connected to:\n\n- NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O (a group)\n- =O (carbonyl)\n- C(Cc1ccccc1) (another benzyl group)\n- NC(=O)C=Cc1occc1 (another group)\n\nThis seems like the central carbon is a branching point with four substituents: an amine-linked group, a carbonyl, a benzyl group, and another amine-linked group.\n\nComparing to Molecule A, which has a linear chain of groups connected via amide bonds. Wait, perhaps the two molecules are structural isomers where the connectivity is different. For example, the central part in Molecule A is a chain, while in Molecule B it's a branch. Alternatively, maybe the order of the groups is different but the connectivity is the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are different representations of the same molecule due to different ordering of branches. In SMILES, branches are written in parentheses, but the order doesn't matter as long as the connectivity is the same. So maybe the two SMILES strings have different branch orders but the same structure.\n\nFor example, the central part of Molecule A is NC(...)C(=O)NC(...)C(=O)O. Molecule B's central part is C(...)(=O)C(...)NC(...). Hmm. Let's try to draw both structures.\n\nMolecule A: Starting from the left, we have a carbonyl group (O=C) attached to a propenyl-furan group. Then, an amide linkage (N) connected to a carbon that has a benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1) and a carbonyl group (C(=O)). Then another amide linkage (N) connected to a carbon with another benzyl group and a carboxylic acid (C(=O)O). So the structure is:\n\nO=C-(propenyl-furan) - N-(CH2Ph)-C(=O)-N-(CH2Ph)-C(=O)OH\n\nWhere Ph is phenyl.\n\nMolecule B: The central carbon is C(...)(=O)C(...)NC(=O)... Let's parse it as:\n\nThe central carbon has four groups:\n\n1. NC(PhCH2)C(=O)O (amine connected to a carbon that has a benzyl group and a carbonyloxy group)\n2. =O (carbonyl)\n3. C(PhCH2) (benzyl group)\n4. NC(=O)propenyl-ring (amine connected to a carbonyl group attached to a propenyl-ring)\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nCentral carbon (C) connected to:\n\n- N-(CH2Ph)-C(=O)O\n- =O\n- CH2Ph\n- N-C(=O)-propenyl-ring (with different ring substitution)\n\nWait, but the way the groups are connected in Molecule B's SMILES suggests that the central carbon is a branching point with those four groups. Whereas in Molecule A, the structure is a linear chain of amide bonds. So unless the central carbon in B is part of a different arrangement, the connectivity would differ.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for Molecule B is a different representation where the central carbon is part of a different arrangement. For example, in Molecule A, the carbonyl group is part of an amide linkage, while in Molecule B, the central carbon is a ketone with various substituents.\n\nWait, let's compare the two structures more carefully.\n\nIn Molecule A: The sequence is:\n\nO=C(...) - N - CH2Ph - C(=O) - N - CH2Ph - C(=O)OH\n\nIn Molecule B: The central part is a carbon connected to:\n\n- A group: N - CH2Ph - C(=O)OH\n- A carbonyl (=O)\n- A benzyl group (CH2Ph)\n- A group: N - C(=O) - propenyl-ring\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nCentral C with substituents:\n\n1. N-CH2Ph-C(=O)OH\n2. =O\n3. CH2Ph\n4. N-C(=O)-propenyl-ring\n\nThis central carbon is connected to four different groups. Whereas in Molecule A, the structure is a linear chain of amide bonds. Therefore, the two molecules have different connectivity and are not the same.\n\nAnother way to check is to compare the molecular formulas. Let's count the atoms:\n\nMolecule A: \n\nBreaking down the SMILES:\n\nO=C(C=Cc1ccco1)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O\n\nEach part:\n\n- O=C: 1 O, 1 C\n- (C=Cc1ccco1): C=C is 2 C. The ring c1ccco1: 4 C (since c is aromatic C), 1 O. So total here: 2 + 4 C + 1 O = 6 C, 1 O. But wait, the ring has 5 members: c1 (C), c (C), c (C), o (O), and another c (C). Wait, the ring closure is 1, so the ring is five atoms. So c1ccco1 is five atoms: 4 C and 1 O. So the ring is 4 C and 1 O. The propenyl is C=C, so the entire group is C=C-(ring: 4 C, 1 O). So that part contributes 2 (C=C) + 4 C + 1 O = 6 C, 1 O.\n\nThen the rest:\n\nNC(...): N, then C connected to Cc1ccccc1 (benzyl: 1 C, then 6 C in benzene ring). Then C(=O): 1 C, O. Then another NC(...) with another benzyl, and C(=O)O: 1 C, 2 O.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nO=C part: O, C.\n\nPropenyl-ring: 6 C, 1 O.\n\nThen N.\n\nThen C connected to benzyl (1 C + 6 C) and C(=O) (C, O).\n\nThen N.\n\nAnother C connected to benzyl (1 C + 6 C) and C(=O)O (C, 2 O).\n\nNow counting:\n\nTotal atoms:\n\nC: \n\nFrom O=C: 1 C.\n\nPropenyl-ring: 6 C.\n\nN: no C.\n\nNext part: C (1) + benzyl (1+6=7) + C(=O) (1) \u2192 1+7+1=9 C.\n\nThen N.\n\nNext part: C (1) + benzyl (7) + C(=O)O (1 C) \u2192 1+7+1=9 C.\n\nTotal C: 1 +6 +9 +9 = 25 C.\n\nO: \n\nO=C: 1 O.\n\nPropenyl-ring: 1 O.\n\nC(=O): 1 O.\n\nC(=O)O: 2 O (from the last group).\n\nPlus the O in the last C(=O)O: so that's 1 O from the previous C(=O) and 1 O in the -O.\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nO in O=C: 1.\n\nPropenyl-ring O:1.\n\nC(=O) in the middle: 1 O.\n\nC(=O)O at the end: 2 O (the carbonyl O and the hydroxyl O).\n\nSo total O: 1 +1 +1 +2 =5 O.\n\nPlus the O in the other C(=O) in the middle? Wait, the middle part is NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)NC(...). The C(=O) here is another carbonyl, so that's another O. Wait, I think I missed that. Let's parse again:\n\nMolecule A: O=C(...)NC(...)C(=O)NC(...)C(=O)O\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nO=C (1 O, 1 C)\n\nthen N connected to C(Cc1ccccc1) which has a C, then C(=O) (another O), then N connected to C(Cc1ccccc1), then C(=O)O (2 O).\n\nSo the O's are:\n\n- O=C:1 O\n\n- C(=O) after first N:1 O\n\n- C(=O)O at the end:2 O\n\nPlus the propenyl-ring O:1.\n\nSo total O:1+1+2+1=5. But wait, there's another C(=O) after the first N. Let's see:\n\nThe structure is:\n\nO=C(...) - N - C(Cc1ccccc1) - C(=O) - N - C(...) - C(=O)O.\n\nSo the middle C(=O) is another O. So O count:\n\n1 (O=C) +1 (propenyl-ring O) +1 (middle C=O) +2 (end C(=O)O) = 5 O.\n\nNitrogens: 2 (two amide N's).\n\nHydrogens: Not counting, but molecular formula would need that. However, since the question is about identity, the formula must match. Let's check Molecule B's formula.\n\nMolecule B: C(NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O)(=O)C(Cc1ccccc1)NC(=O)C=Cc1occc1.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nCentral C connected to:\n\n- NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O: N, C connected to benzyl (7 C: Cc1ccccc1 is CH2-Ph, which is 1+6=7 C?), then C(=O)O (1 C, 2 O).\n\n- =O (O)\n\n- C(Cc1ccccc1): C connected to benzyl (7 C)\n\n- NC(=O)C=Cc1occc1: N connected to C(=O) (O), then C=C attached to ring c1occc1 (which is 4 C and 1 O, similar to previous analysis).\n\nCounting C:\n\nCentral C:1.\n\nNC(...) group: C in N-C is 1, plus benzyl 7, plus C(=O)O:1. Total:1+7+1=9 C.\n\n=O: no C.\n\nC(Cc1ccccc1):1 C +7 C=8 C.\n\nNC(=O)...: N, C(=O) (1 C), C=C (2 C), ring (4 C). Total:1+2+4=7 C.\n\nTotal C:1 (central) +9 +8 +7 =25 C.\n\nO:\n\nNC(...)C(=O)O: 2 O (from C(=O)O).\n\nCentral =O:1 O.\n\nNC(=O)...:1 O (from C(=O)).\n\nRing c1occc1:1 O.\n\nTotal O:2+1+1+1=5 O.\n\nNitrogens: 2 (the NC and the NC(=O)).\n\nSo the molecular formulas for both molecules are C25H... (don't know H count, but since the formulas for C and O and N are the same, the difference would be in connectivity.\n\nBut since the formulas are the same, they could be isomers. But the key is whether the connectivity is the same.\n\nThe critical differences are:\n\n1. The position of the oxygen in the ring (A has it in one position, B in another).\n\n2. The connectivity of the central part. In Molecule A, it's a linear chain of amides, while in B, the central carbon is a branching point with four substituents.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the SMILES for Molecule B. Let's parse it again.\n\nMolecule B: C(NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O)(=O)C(Cc1ccccc1)NC(=O)C=Cc1occc1.\n\nThe central atom is a carbon (denoted by the first C). Its substituents are:\n\n- NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O: This is a branch starting with N connected to C, which has two substituents: Cc1ccccc1 (benzyl) and C(=O)O (carboxy group). So the N is part of an amide or urea group?\n\nThen the central C has a =O (carbonyl), a C(Cc1ccccc1) (benzyl group), and a NC(=O)C=Cc1occc1 (amide group).\n\nSo the structure is a central carbon connected to:\n\n1. An N-(benzyl)-carboxy group (NC(Cc1...)C(=O)O)\n2. A carbonyl group (=O)\n3. A benzyl group (C(Cc1...))\n4. An amide group (N-C(=O)-propenyl-ring)\n\nThis suggests that the central carbon is a quaternary carbon connected to four different groups. In contrast, Molecule A has a linear chain of amide bonds. Therefore, the connectivity is different, making them different molecules.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider that in Molecule A, the sequence is O=C-...-N-CH2Ph-C(=O)-N-CH2Ph-C(=O)OH, which is a tripeptide-like structure with two amide bonds. In Molecule B, the central part is a carbon connected to an amide group, a carbonyl, a benzyl, and another amide group. This would be a different structure, possibly a branched molecule rather than a linear one.\n\nMoreover, the rings in the propenyl groups are different, as discussed earlier. Even if the rest of the structure were the same, the differing rings would make the molecules different.\n\nTherefore, the two molecules are not the same. The answer should be \"No\".",

The ring structure is c1 connected to an oxygen (O), then a c2 which is part of another ring. The c2 part has a cyano group (cnn) attached to a benzene ring with fluorine (-c3ccc(F)cc3). Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally.\n\nMolecule A's SMILES: The sulfur is part of a ring. The ring structure is: S connected to c1, which is connected to n (with O as a substituent?), then c2, which has a chain with cnn- (which is a nitrile group? Or maybe an amine with a nitro group? Wait, the SMILES notation can be tricky. Let's parse step by step.\n\nBreaking down Molecule A:\n- The main chain is CCCCCS (pentylthio group).\n- Then we have a ring: c1 connected to n, which has an O (so perhaps the ring is a five-membered ring? Let's see: c1 is connected to n (with O), then c2, which is part of a cnn group attached to another benzene ring. The benzene ring is -c3ccc(F)cc3, which is a fluorophenyl group attached via the nitrogens?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ring in Molecule A is a bicyclic system. Let's see: the sulfur is part of the ring. The c1 is part of the ring, connected to n (with O), then c2 which is part of a cyano (c=n?) and a nitro group? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to write the structure more systematically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for Molecule A is:\n\nThe pentylthio group (CCCCC-S-) attached to a ring. The ring starts at S, then goes to c1, which is connected to a nitrogen (n) that has an oxygen (O) substituent. Then, from that nitrogen, there's a connection to c2. The c2 is connected to a nitrogen (n) which is part of a nitrile group (nn-...). Wait, the SMILES is c2cnn(-c3ccc(F)cc3)c2n1. So, the c2 is part of a chain that goes c-n-n(-c3...). The -c3ccc(F)cc3 is a benzene ring with fluorine, connected via the nitrogen. So the nitrogens are in a chain: c connected to n, then another n which is connected to the fluorophenyl group. Then, that chain is connected back to c2, which is part of the original ring. The ring closure is c2 back to n1. So the ring in Molecule A is a bicyclic system, perhaps a thiazole or similar heterocycle with an oxygen and nitrogens.\n\nNow, Molecule B: Oc1nc(nc2n(ncc12)-c1ccc(cc1)F)SCCCCC. Let's parse this. Starting with O, which is part of a ring. The ring starts at O (Oc1...). Then, the ring has n, c, (nc2n(ncc12)), which seems a bit complex. The SCCCCC is the pentylthio group at the end. \n\nBreaking down Molecule B: The oxygen is part of a ring. The ring structure is O connected to c1, which is connected to n, then c, which has a substituent nc2n(ncc12). The n in nc2... suggests a nitrogen connected to a c2. The part n(ncc12) could be a nitrogen with two substituents: one is cc12 (which is a ring closure between c2 and c1?), and the other is part of a chain. The -c1ccc(cc1)F is a fluorophenyl group. \n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the SMILES for Molecule B. Let me check again. The SMILES is Oc1nc(nc2n(ncc12)-c1ccc(cc1)F)SCCCCC. Hmm. The ring starts at O (Oc1...), then the c1 is connected to n, then c (with substituent nc2n(ncc12)), then another part. The substituent nc2n(ncc12) might form a bridge between rings. The part -c1ccc(cc1)F is a fluorophenyl group attached via a nitrogen? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES notation is a bit tangled. Let me try to map the ring closures. Molecule B has Oc1... (ring 1), and within that, there's nc2... (ring 2). The ncc12 part suggests that the nitrogen is connected to c, which is part of ring 1 (closure 1) and ring 2 (closure 2). This could indicate a fused ring system. \n\nThe key is to compare the structures of Molecule A and B. Both have a pentylthio group (SCCCCC in B, which is the same as CCCCCS in A, but written in reverse). The rest of the structure involves rings with oxygen, nitrogens, and a fluorophenyl group. \n\nThe main question is whether the connectivity of the atoms is the same, just written in a different order. SMILES can represent the same molecule with different atom numbering and ring closure orders. So even if the SMILES strings look different, they might be the same if the connectivity is identical.\n\nTo determine if they're the same, I can try converting both SMILES to their canonical forms using a tool like RDKit. However, since I can't execute code here, I need to analyze them manually. Let's attempt to draw both structures mentally.\n\nMolecule A's structure:\n- Pentylthio group attached to a sulfur atom which is part of a ring.\n- The ring (let's say ring 1) starts at S, then goes to c1 (which is part of the ring), then to n (with an O attached), then to c2 (part of another ring or a substituent?), then to n, which connects to another nitrogen that's part of a fluorophenyl group (-c3ccc(F)cc3).\n\nWait, maybe the ring is a bicyclic system. Let's consider that in SMILES, the numbering of ring closures doesn't affect the structure, just the order in which they're written. So, if two SMILES have the same atoms connected in the same order but with different ring closure numbers, they're the same.\n\nAlternatively, the rings might be arranged differently. For example, in Molecule A, the sulfur is part of a ring that includes the oxygen and nitrogens, while in Molecule B, the oxygen is part of a different ring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both molecules have the same substituents but arranged in different positions. The fluorophenyl group in A is attached via a nitrogen in the nitrile group, while in B it's attached via another nitrogen.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the core structure is the same, but the SMILES strings are written starting from different atoms, leading to different orders. For example, if one starts at the sulfur and the other at the oxygen, the SMILES would look different but represent the same molecule.\n\nLet me try to compare the substituents. Both have a pentylthio group (S-CCCCC vs. SCCCCC, which is the same), an oxygen atom (O in A is attached to the nitrogen in the ring; in B, the O is part of the ring), and a fluorophenyl group.\n\nWait, in Molecule A, the O is a substituent on the nitrogen in the ring (c1nc(O)...), whereas in Molecule B, the O is part of the ring (Oc1...). That suggests a different arrangement. In A, the O is an hydroxyl group attached to a nitrogen in the ring. In B, the O is part of the ring, making it an oxygen atom in the ring (like in a furan or similar). However, hydroxyl groups (O) attached to a ring would be written as O in SMILES, while ring oxygen would be denoted as o (lowercase), but wait, SMILES uses uppercase letters for elements, so O is oxygen regardless. Wait, no, in SMILES, aromatic rings are denoted with lowercase letters. Wait, wait, aromatic atoms in SMILES are written in lowercase. So, in Molecule A, the ring is aromatic, so the atoms are lowercase. So, 'c' is aromatic carbon, 'n' is aromatic nitrogen. In Molecule B, the same applies.\n\nSo, in Molecule A: the ring starts with sulfur (non-aromatic?), then c1 (aromatic carbon), n (aromatic nitrogen), etc. Wait, but sulfur can be part of aromatic rings in certain cases (like thiophene), but in SMILES, aromaticity is determined by lowercase letters. The sulfur here is uppercase S, which is not part of an aromatic ring. Wait, no, in SMILES, aromaticity is perceived by the tool, but the letters (lowercase for aromatic atoms) are part of the notation. So lowercase 'c' is aromatic carbon, uppercase 'C' is aliphatic. But in the given SMILES, all carbons in rings are lowercase 'c', so they are considered aromatic. Sulfur here is uppercase 'S', so it's not part of the aromatic system. Wait, but how does that work? For example, in thiophene, the sulfur is part of the aromatic ring, but in SMILES, it's written as 'c1csc1' with lowercase 'c' and 's' (lowercase s would be aromatic sulfur). But in the given SMILES, the sulfur is uppercase S in both molecules. For Molecule A: the sulfur is part of the ring as 'Sc1...', so it's a non-aromatic sulfur in the ring. Wait, but the rest of the ring atoms are lowercase 'c' and 'n', which are aromatic. That might not make sense. This could indicate that the ring is not aromatic, or there's an error in the SMILES notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES strings are not correctly considering aromaticity, but I need to proceed with the given input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two SMILES strings are actually the same molecule but written with different ring numbering. Let's attempt to map them.\n\nIn Molecule A, the sulfur is part of the ring. The ring is S-c1-n-c(O)-c2-c-n-n(-c3ccc(F)cc3)-c2-n1. So the ring is a 6-membered ring? S-c1-n-c(O)-c2-n1 (but then where does the c2 connect? Wait, the SMILES is CCCCCSc1nc(O)c2cnn(-c3ccc(F)cc3)c2n1. So the ring is S connected to c1, which is connected to n, then c (with O), then c2, then n, then back to c2 (but that's part of the ring?), maybe forming a fused ring. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two SMILES are different representations of the same structure. For example, if the order of the substituents on the ring is different but the connectivity is the same. Or if the starting point for writing the SMILES is different.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of each atom type and check if they match. Both have the same elements: C, S, O, N, F. Let's count:\n\nMolecule A: CCCCCSc1nc(O)c2cnn(-c3ccc(F)cc3)c2n1\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- C: 5 (from CCCCC) + 2 (from Sc1 and c1) + 1 (O is attached to c?) + 2 (c2 and c in c2cnn) + 3 (from c3ccc(F)cc3) + others? Wait, perhaps a more systematic approach:\n\nMolecule A:\n\n- The pentyl chain: 5 Cs (CCCCC)\n- S\n- The ring part: c1 (aromatic C) connected to n (aromatic N), which has O (so O is a substituent here)\n- Then c2 (aromatic C) connected to n (aromatic N), which is part of a chain: cnn- (so two Ns here)\n- The fluorophenyl group: c3ccc(F)cc3 has 6 Cs (but in SMILES, the c's are aromatic carbons; the F is attached to one of them)\nSo total Cs: 5 (pentyl) + 2 (c1 and c2) + 6 (phenyl) + others? Wait, maybe I'm missing some. Let's count all atoms:\n\nMolecule A:\n\n- Pentyl: 5 C\n- S: 1\n- c1: 1 C (aromatic)\n- n: 1 N (aromatic)\n- O: 1\n- c2: 1 C (aromatic)\n- c in cnn: 1 C (aromatic)\n- n's in cnn: 2 N (aromatic)\n- Fluorophenyl group: 6 C (aromatic), 1 F\n- n1: 1 N (aromatic)\nTotal C: 5 +1 +1 +1 +6 = 14?\nNitrogen: 1 (n) + 2 (cnn) +1 (n1) = 4?\nOxygen:1\nSulfur:1\nFluorine:1\n\nMolecule B: Oc1nc(nc2n(ncc12)-c1ccc(cc1)F)SCCCCC\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- O:1\n- c1: aromatic C in the ring\n- n: aromatic N\n- c connected to nc2n(ncc12)\n- nc2: aromatic N connected to c2\n- n(ncc12): aromatic N connected to n, c, c1, c2\n- Then -c1ccc(cc1)F: fluorophenyl group\n- SCCCCC: pentylthio group (S followed by 5 C)\n\nLet's count:\n\n- O:1\n- Pentyl:5 C\n- S:1\n- Fluorophenyl:6 C, 1 F\n- The ring parts: c1, c2, etc. How many Cs and Ns here?\n\nThis is getting a bit too complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to recognize that the two SMILES strings might represent the same molecule if the connectivity is identical, just written in a different order. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order of substituents on the rings is different. For instance, in Molecule A, the O is on the nitrogen, while in Molecule B, the O is part of the ring. But that would make them different molecules. Wait, in Molecule A, the O is attached to the nitrogen in the ring (c1nc(O)...), which would be a nitro group or an hydroxylamine group. In Molecule B, the O is part of the ring (Oc1...), which would be like an oxygen in the ring (e.g., a furan-like ring). That would make them different structures. \n\nWait, but in SMILES, if the O is part of the ring, it would be written as O in the ring sequence. For example, in a furan ring, it's o1cccc1, but since the O is in the ring, it's lowercase 'o'. However, in the given SMILES, the O is uppercase, which would indicate it's not part of the aromatic ring. Wait, no, in SMILES, lowercase letters denote aromatic atoms. So 'O' in the ring would not be aromatic. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:\n\nIn SMILES notation, aromatic atoms are denoted with lowercase letters (c, n, o, s, etc.), and aliphatic atoms are uppercase. So, if a ring is aromatic, the atoms in the ring are written in lowercase. For example, benzene is c1ccccc1. A furan would be o1cccc1 (lowercase o for aromatic oxygen). But in the given SMILES strings, both molecules have uppercase O's, which means they're not part of the aromatic system. So in Molecule A, the O is a substituent on the aromatic nitrogen (n(O)), making it a nitro group (if bonded to N) or an hydroxyl group (if O is attached as -O-). Wait, nitro groups are typically written as [N+](=O)[O-], but in SMILES, if the N is part of an aromatic ring, adding an O substituent might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the O in Molecule A is an hydroxyl group attached to the nitrogen. That would make it an -NH-O group? But I'm not sure. The SMILES syntax here is a bit unclear. Similarly, in Molecule B, the O is at the start of the ring (Oc1...), which would suggest it's an oxygen connected to the aromatic carbon c1, but since it's uppercase O, it's an ether oxygen or hydroxyl group. But if the ring is aromatic, the O would not be part of the aromatic system because it's uppercase.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Given that the two SMILES have the same atoms but different arrangements, I need to determine if they are isomorphic. Since I can't use a tool, I'll try to map the connections.\n\nAnother approach: look for the same substituents in both molecules. Both have a pentylthio group (S connected to five carbons), a fluorophenyl group, multiple nitrogens, and an oxygen. The question is whether these groups are connected in the same way.\n\nIn Molecule A, the fluorophenyl group is attached via a nitrogen in the cnn(-c3...) part. In Molecule B, the fluorophenyl is attached via a nitrogen in the -c1ccc(cc1)F part. Wait, the SMILES for Molecule B has \"-c1ccc(cc1)F\" which is a benzene ring with fluorine, attached via a carbon. Wait, no: the \"-c1ccc(cc1)F\" is written as a benzene ring where the attachment point is the first carbon, then three carbons, a fluorine, and two more carbons. But SMILES notation for benzene rings can be written in different ways. For example, c1ccc(F)cc1 would place the F at position 4. But depending on the numbering, the position can vary. However, in SMILES, the order in the string defines the positions. So \"-c3ccc(F)cc3\" in Molecule A is a benzene ring with fluorine in the para position relative to the attachment point. Similarly, \"-c1ccc(cc1)F\" in Molecule B would have fluorine in the para position as well, assuming the attachment is at position 1. So the fluorophenyl groups are attached similarly in both molecules.\n\nNow, the main difference seems to be the arrangement of the rings and the placement of the oxygen. In Molecule A, the oxygen is a substituent on a nitrogen in the ring, while in Molecule B, the oxygen is part of the ring structure. If that's the case, then the molecules are different. However, maybe the oxygen is in the same position but written differently due to SMILES notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rings are the same, but written in reverse. For example, if the ring in A is S-c1-n-C(O)-... and in B is O-c1-n-C-S-..., then they would be different. But if the connectivity is the same but the starting point is different, they could be the same.\n\nAnother angle: canonical SMILES. If we could generate the canonical SMILES for both, they would be identical if the molecules are the same. Since I can't do that here, I need to reason it out.\n\nGiven the complexity of the structures, I think the two SMILES represent the same molecule. The differences in the SMILES strings might be due to different starting points and ring numbering. For example, the pentylthio group is written as CCCCCS in A and SCCCCC in B, which is the same group. The oxygen in A is attached to a nitrogen in one ring, while in B, it's part of a different ring. Wait, no\u2014that would make them different. But perhaps the rings are connected in a way that the oxygen is actually in the same position but written differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the core structure is a bicyclic system with the same substituents but different SMILES representations. For example, if the rings are fused in the same way but the SMILES starts from different atoms, leading to different notations.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the two molecules are actually the same, just represented with different SMILES strings due to varying starting points and ring numbering. Therefore, the answer should be \"Yes\".",

Let's start by looking at Molecule A and Molecule B's SMILES.\n\nMolecule A: COc1ccc(CC2NCCc3c2[nH]c2ccc(SC)cc32)cc1OC\nMolecule B: c1c(OC)c(OC)ccc1CC1NCCc2c3c([nH]c21)ccc(SC)c3\n\nFirst, I'll parse each SMILES to understand their structures. SMILES can sometimes be written in different orders but still represent the same molecule. So I need to check if the atoms and connectivity are the same.\n\nStarting with Molecule A. The core is a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1OC) with two methoxy groups (OC) at positions 1 and... wait, the SMILES starts with COc1ccc..., so the first oxygen is connected to a methyl group (CO-), so that's a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring. Then there's a substituent at position 4 (since the ring is c1ccc(CC2...)cc1OC), so the substituent is CC2NCCc3c2[nH]c2ccc(SC)cc32. Let me break that down.\n\nThe substituent is a chain starting with CC2, meaning a carbon connected to another carbon (maybe ethyl group?), then N (amine) connected to C (maybe a cyclohexane or another ring?), then there's a ring closure with c3c2. The [nH] suggests a pyrrole-like ring with a hydrogen on the nitrogen. The rest of the structure might form a fused ring system. Then there's a thioether group (SC) attached to another benzene ring.\n\nNow looking at Molecule B: c1c(OC)c(OC)ccc1CC1NCCc2c3c([nH]c21)ccc(SC)c3. The benzene ring here starts with c1, then two methoxy groups (OC) on adjacent carbons? The positions might differ. The substituent is CC1NCCc2c3c([nH]c21)..., which seems similar to Molecule A's substituent but perhaps written in a different order. The fused rings here might be arranged differently. \n\nWait, SMILES can sometimes be written with different starting points or ring numbering, which can change the order but not the actual structure. So I need to check if the substituents are the same in connectivity but written in different orders. \n\nLet me compare the substituent parts. Both have CC followed by a nitrogen. In A: CC2NCCc3c2[nH]c2ccc(SC)cc32. In B: CC1NCCc2c3c([nH]c21)ccc(SC)c3. Let's map the rings. In A, the substituent after CC2N is a cyclohexane? Let me see: The part after N is CCc3c2[nH]... So maybe a ring formed by atoms 2,3, etc. \n\nIn Molecule A's substituent: The structure after CC2N is C C c3c2. So maybe a bridge or fused rings. The [nH] is part of a ring. Then there's a c2ccc(SC)cc32, which forms another ring fused with the first. So perhaps a bicyclic system with a sulfur-containing substituent.\n\nIn Molecule B's substituent: CC1NCCc2c3c([nH]c21)ccc(SC)c3. Here, the ring closures might be different. The [nH]c21 suggests that the nitrogen is part of a ring connected to atom 2 and 1. The c2c3c...ccc(SC)c3 would form another ring. \n\nIt's possible that both substituents are the same but written with different numbering. Let me try to draw both structures mentally. \n\nThe core benzene ring in both molecules has two methoxy groups. In A, the benzene is COc1ccc(...)cc1OC, which implies the methoxy groups are at positions 1 and 4 (assuming the ring is numbered starting from the first carbon). Wait, SMILES strings can be written in a way that the ring starts at any position, so the actual positions might differ when written differently. But in SMILES, the order of the atoms in the string affects how the substituents are placed. For example, in Molecule A, the benzene ring is written as COc1ccc(CC2...)cc1OC. So the first carbon (position 1) has the methoxy (CO-), then positions 2,3,4 have the substituent (CC2...), and position 6 (the last cc1OC) has another methoxy (OC). So methoxy groups at positions 1 and 6. Alternatively, depending on how the ring is closed, positions might be different. \n\nIn Molecule B, the benzene is written as c1c(OC)c(OC)ccc1..., which would have methoxy groups at positions 2 and 3? Because the first three carbons are c1, then c(OC), then c(OC), followed by three more carbons (ccc1). So the ring is positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. The substituents OC are on positions 2 and 3. Then the rest is CC1N... So maybe the methoxy groups are at 2 and 3 in B, whereas in A they are at 1 and 6. But if the rings are numbered differently due to SMILES notation, they could actually be the same. For example, if the benzene ring in A is written starting at a different point, the positions could be equivalent. \n\nWait, benzene rings are symmetric. If in A the methoxy groups are on positions 1 and 6 (which are adjacent in a benzene ring?), no, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1 and 6 would be adjacent if the ring is written in order. Wait, SMILES strings for benzene rings are linearized. So in a benzene ring written as c1ccccc1, the positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So in A, the substituents are on positions 1 and 6 (since COc1ccc(...)cc1OC: the first carbon is 1 (CO-), then positions 2,3,4 (the three c's before the substituent), the substituent is on position 4, then positions 5,6 (the two c's after the substituent) with the last OC on position 6. Wait, no. Let me parse the SMILES properly. \n\nIn Molecule A: COc1ccc(CC2...)cc1OC. The benzene ring starts with COc1, then three c's (positions 2,3,4?), then the substituent (CC2...) is attached at position 4. Then after that, two c's (positions 5,6?), followed by closing the ring with cc1OC. The OC at the end is attached to position 6. So methoxy groups at positions 1 and 6. \n\nIn Molecule B: c1c(OC)c(OC)ccc1... The benzene starts with c1, then position 2 has OC, position 3 has OC, followed by three c's (positions 4,5,6), then closing the ring with ccc1. So methoxy groups at positions 2 and 3. \n\nBut benzene rings are symmetrical. If you rotate the ring, positions 1 and 6 in A could align with positions 2 and 3 in B if the entire molecule is rotated. However, the substituents' positions relative to the other parts of the molecule matter. If the substituent (the CC2N... part) is attached to position 4 in A, and in B, the substituent is attached to position 1 (since the main chain is c1c(OC)c(OC)ccc1CC1N... So the CC is attached to position 1 of the benzene ring in B. Wait, let me parse B again. \n\nMolecule B: c1c(OC)c(OC)ccc1CC1NCCc2c3c([nH]c21)ccc(SC)c3.\n\nBreaking down the benzene ring: c1 is the first atom. Then the next atom is c(OC) (position 2), then c(OC) (position 3), then ccc1 (positions 4,5,6, closing back to position 1). So the benzene ring has OC groups on positions 2 and 3. Then the CC1N... is attached to position 1 (since after the benzene ring, it's CC1...). Wait, the benzene ring is c1c(OC)c(OC)ccc1, so the CC is attached to position 1 of the benzene ring. \n\nSo in A, the substituent is attached to position 4, and in B, it's attached to position 1. But depending on how the benzene rings are oriented, maybe these are the same. However, the substituent's position relative to the methoxy groups would differ. In A, methoxy groups are at 1 and 6; substituent at 4. In B, methoxy at 2 and 3; substituent at 1. If we rotate the benzene ring in A such that the substituent is at position 1, then the methoxy groups would shift positions. However, benzene is symmetric, but with substituents in different positions, the overall structure might be different unless there's a plane of symmetry.\n\nWait, let me imagine the benzene rings. In A, substituents at 1 (OCH3), 4 (the CC... group), and 6 (OCH3). In B, substituents at 1 (CC... group), 2 (OCH3), 3 (OCH3). If we rotate the benzene ring so that position 4 in A becomes position 1, then the methoxy groups would be at positions 3 and 6 (original 1 and 6). But this might not align with B's structure. Alternatively, if the benzene in A is actually written starting from a different position, but SMILES strings can start anywhere. For example, if in A, the benzene starts at the substituent's position, perhaps the numbering would be different. However, SMILES strings are written in a way that the order of atoms determines the positions. So if the substituent is in a different position relative to the methoxy groups, the molecules would be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituent in B is attached to position 1, which in A's case is position 4. If that's the case, the substituent's position relative to the methoxy groups would differ, making them different molecules. \n\nAdditionally, looking at the substituent structures. Both have a CC connected to an amine (N), then a cyclohexane or bicyclic system. Let's compare the substituent parts:\n\nMolecule A substituent: CC2NCCc3c2[nH]c2ccc(SC)cc32\n\nBreaking down: CC2NCCc3c2... So after CC2N, there's a CC, then c3 connected to c2 (from the CC2). The [nH] is in a ring (c2...). Then there's a c2ccc(SC)cc32, which forms another ring. So this forms a bicyclic system where the nitrogen is part of one ring and connected to another ring with the SC group.\n\nMolecule B substituent: CC1NCCc2c3c([nH]c21)ccc(SC)c3\n\nHere, CC1NCCc2c3c(...). The [nH]c21 implies that the nitrogen is part of a ring connecting atoms 2 and 1 (from the substituent's ring). The c2c3c... then forms another ring. The substituent also has SC attached. \n\nIf the substituent structures are isomorphic, then the molecules could be the same. But the way the rings are closed might be different. Let me try to map the atoms. In A's substituent, after CC2N, the next part is C C c3c2. So perhaps a bridge between the nitrogen and another carbon. Then [nH] is in a ring with c2 (from the substituent) and other atoms. \n\nAlternatively, in B's substituent, after CC1NCC, there's c2 connected to c3, and [nH] is part of a ring connecting back to atom 1 and 2. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can try to canonicalize both SMILES strings using a tool like RDKit. Since the user is asking for a determination without using external tools, I have to do this manually. \n\nAlternatively, think about whether the substituents are identical but written with different ring numbering. For example, the substituent in A has a ring closure at 2 and 3, while in B it's at 1 and 2. If that's the case, they might represent the same structure. \n\nAlso, check for the same atoms and bonds. Both molecules have two methoxy groups, a CC connected to a bicyclic amine system with a thioether group. The question is whether the arrangement of these groups is the same. \n\nAnother approach: If the two SMILES strings, when canonicalized, are the same, then the molecules are identical. But since I can't compute that here, I need to compare manually. \n\nLooking again, the benzene rings in A and B have different substitution patterns. In A, methoxy at positions 1 and 6 (assuming the ring is written as COc1ccc...cc1OC), whereas in B, methoxy at positions 2 and 3. Unless there's a symmetry that makes these equivalent. However, a benzene ring with two methoxy groups at para positions (positions 1 and 4) would be different from meta (positions 2 and 3). Wait, but in A, the methoxy groups are at 1 and 6 (which are adjacent?), but benzene has six positions. Wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other (para), positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), and positions 1 and 3 are meta. \n\nIn A's benzene ring: COc1ccc(CC2...)cc1OC. The first OCH3 is at position 1. The ring is written as c1, then three c's (positions 2,3,4), then the substituent at position 4. Then two more c's (positions 5,6) before closing the ring. The second OCH3 is at position 6. So positions 1 and 6 are adjacent (ortho). So in A, the methoxy groups are ortho to each other. \n\nIn B's benzene ring: c1c(OC)c(OC)ccc1. The OCH3 groups are at positions 2 and 3, which are adjacent (ortho). Then the substituent is at position 1. So in B, the substituent is at position 1, with methoxy groups at 2 and 3 (all three substituents adjacent). \n\nIn A, substituent is at position 4, methoxy at 1 and 6. So substituent is across from position 1 (which is methoxy), and next to position 6 (methoxy). \n\nIf the benzene rings are rotated, perhaps the substituent positions can be matched. But benzene is a planar ring with symmetry. For example, if you rotate the ring such that position 4 in A becomes position 1, then methoxy groups would be at positions 3 and 4 (if rotated 180 degrees). But this might not align with B's structure. \n\nAlternatively, imagine flipping the ring. The key is whether the substituent's position relative to the methoxy groups is the same. In A, substituent is adjacent to one methoxy (position 6) and opposite another (position 1). In B, substituent is adjacent to two methoxy groups (positions 2 and 3). These are different substitution patterns, so the molecules are not the same. \n\nAdditionally, looking at the substituent structures. If the bicyclic systems are the same but written with different ring closures, then they are the same. For example, the substituent in A has a bridge that might be equivalent to B's substituent. \n\nBut considering all the above, the substitution patterns on the benzene rings are different (ortho vs. adjacent substituents in a different arrangement), and the substituent's position relative to the methoxy groups differ. Therefore, the molecules are not the same.",

Let me start by looking at Molecule A and Molecule B's SMILES notations.\n\nMolecule A: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)-c1cc(Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)nc(=O)n1CC2\n\nMolecule B: c1(cccc(c1Nc1nc(n2c(-c3cc(OC)c(cc3CC2)OC)c1)=O)Cl)Cl\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse both SMILES to understand their structures. SMILES can sometimes be written in different orders but still represent the same molecule, so I need to check if they are isomorphic.\n\nLooking at Molecule A, I see a central ring system. Breaking it down:\n\n- The SMILES starts with COc1cc2c(cc1OC)... which indicates a methoxy group (COc) attached to a benzene ring (the 'c1cc...' part). Then there's a ring junction with another ring (the '2' here). The part '-c1cc(...)nc(=O)n1CC2' suggests another ring connected via a single bond (the '-'), possibly a bicyclic system. There's an amide group (nc(=O)n) and substituents including Cl atoms.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES is written as c1(cccc(c1Nc1nc(n2c(...)c1)=O)Cl)Cl. Let's parse this:\n\n- The core seems to be a benzene ring (c1(cccc(...))Cl). There's an N attached to the ring (Nc1...), leading into another ring (nc(n2c(...)c1)=O). The substituents include Cl atoms and a methoxy group (OC) in a part that might connect to another ring via a bond (the '-c3...' part).\n\nComparing substituents: Both have two Cl atoms, methoxy groups (OC), and an amide group (nc(=O)n). The challenge is to see if the connectivity is the same.\n\nWait, in Molecule A, there's a CC2 at the end, which might be a cyclopropane or a bridge. Molecule B's structure includes a -c3cc(OC)c(cc3CC2)OC part. Let me check if the branching is the same.\n\nIn Molecule A, the part after the central ring is -c1cc(Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)nc(=O)n1CC2. The CC2 here suggests that the ethyl group (CC) connects back to ring 2. In Molecule B, the corresponding part is n2c(-c3cc(OC)c(cc3CC2)OC)c1)=O. The CC2 here connects back to ring 2 as well, which might be part of a bridged structure.\n\nThe key is whether the rings are connected in the same way. For example, in Molecule A, there's a ring 2 connected via the bridge CC2. Similarly, in Molecule B, the CC2 is part of the substituent on ring 3. The presence of two methoxy groups (OC) in both molecules suggests similar substituents.\n\nAnother thing to check is the order of the substituents. SMILES can be written starting from different atoms, leading to different notation but the same structure. For example, benzene rings can be written clockwise or counter-clockwise. To verify, I might need to draw the structures or use a tool to canonicalize the SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, since I can't draw here, I'll compare the elements and connectivity. Both have two Cl atoms, two methoxy groups (OC), an amide group, and a bridged ring system with CC2. The main question is whether the positions of these groups are the same.\n\nIn Molecule A, the Cl atoms are on a benzene ring (c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl), meaning two Cl substituents on adjacent positions? Wait, the notation c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl would be a benzene ring with Cl at positions 1 and 2, perhaps. Then the N is attached to this ring (Nc3...), so the amine group is connected to the Cl-substituted ring.\n\nIn Molecule B, the Cl substituents are on the main benzene ring: the SMILES starts with c1(cccc(c1Nc...)Cl)Cl. So the benzene ring (c1...) has Cl substituents. Then there's an N attached to this ring (Nc1...), leading into another ring.\n\nWait, the substitution patterns might differ. In Molecule A, the Cls are on a separate ring that's connected via an N, while in Molecule B, the Cls are on the main benzene ring. That suggests a different substitution pattern. If that's the case, the molecules are not the same.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misparsing. Let me try again.\n\nMolecule A's SMILES: The part Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl. The 'c3' here is a benzene ring (since c followed by numbers usually denotes a ring closure). So the N is attached to a benzene ring (c3) which has two Cl atoms. The Cls are at positions where the ring starts at c3. So c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl would mean Cl at position 1 and 6 of the benzene ring (since the first atom after c3 is Cl, then the next four c's would continue the ring, and the last Cl is attached before closing the ring with 3. Wait, maybe positions 1 and 2? Let me write it out: the benzene ring is c3C(Cl)cccc3Cl. Wait, actually, the SMILES notation for a benzene ring with two Cls adjacent would be Clc1c(Cl)cccc1, but in this case, it's c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl. So the sequence is c3 (ring closure 3), then c (atom 1), Cl (substituent on atom 1), c (atom 2), c (atom 3), c (atom 4), c (atom 5), then back to ring closure 3 (atom 6). So the Cls are on atoms 1 and 6. So that would be para positions? No, wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 6 are adjacent (since it's a six-membered ring). Wait, numbering starts at the first atom after the ring closure. So in c3c(Cl)cccc3Cl: the ring starts at position 3. Wait, SMILES is tricky because the numbering depends on the order. Let me think: when you have a ring closure like c3, that refers back to the third atom. So the SMILES is:\n\nStart with c3 (atom 1), then c (Cl) (atom 2, with Cl substituent), then c (atom 3), c (atom 4), c (atom 5), c (atom 6), and then closure to atom 3 (so atom 6 connected to atom 3). Wait, that would form a six-membered ring. But the Cl is on atom 2 (the second atom in the SMILES string), and another Cl on closure. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me break down Molecule A's substituent part: Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl. The 'Nc3' means the nitrogen is connected to carbon 3 (ring closure 3). Then, the carbon after N is c3, which is part of a ring closure. The structure would be: N connected to a benzene ring where one Cl is on the carbon adjacent to the N, and another Cl is on the carbon three positions away (para?), but the exact positions depend on how the ring is closed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two Cls are on adjacent carbons. But regardless, in Molecule B, the Cls are on the main benzene ring. So in Molecule B's SMILES: c1(cccc(c1Nc...)Cl)Cl. The main benzene ring is c1(...)Cl)Cl. So the benzene ring (c1) has two Cl substituents. Then there's an N attached to that ring (Nc1...).\n\nIn Molecule A, the N is attached to a separate benzene ring that has two Cls. In Molecule B, the N is attached to the same benzene ring that has the two Cls. That would be a structural difference. Therefore, the molecules are different.\n\nSo, the answer should be No.",

Let me start by analyzing both structures carefully.\n\nFirst, Molecule A: CN(CCCNc1ccnc2cc(Cl)ccc12)C(=O)c1ccccc1. Breaking this down, the central part seems to be an N-methyl group attached to a carbonyl (C=O) which is connected to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1). The methyl group (C) is connected to a nitrogen, which is also attached to a propyl chain (CCCN) that leads to a pyridine ring (c1ccnc...). The pyridine has a chlorine substituent on one of the adjacent benzene rings. Wait, let me parse that again. The part after the propyl chain is Nc1ccnc2cc(Cl)ccc12. So the nitrogen is connected to a pyridine ring (ccnc) and then another benzene ring (cc(Cl)ccc12) with a chlorine in position 2? Or maybe the numbering is different. The SMILES notation can sometimes be tricky with ring closures.\n\nNow Molecule B: C(N(C(c1ccccc1)=O)C)CCNc1ccnc2cc(ccc12)Cl. Let's parse this. Starting with C(...), which is a methyl group connected to a nitrogen. The nitrogen is attached to a carbonyl group (C=O) which is connected to another benzene ring (c1ccccc1). Then, the methyl group is also connected to a propyl chain (CCNc...). Wait, the propyl chain here is CCN, which is three carbons? Let me see: the structure is C(N(...))CCN... So the nitrogen has a methyl (C), then a propyl (CCN). The propyl ends with N connected to the same pyridine and benzene rings as in A? The pyridine part here is c1ccnc2cc(ccc12)Cl. Comparing to A, in A the chlorine is on the benzene ring as cc(Cl)ccc12, while in B it's cc(ccc12)Cl. Wait, no\u2014that might be the same. Let me check the ring closures. In A, the benzene ring after pyridine is connected via positions 1 and 2: c2cc(Cl)ccc12. So the chlorine is on position 4 of the benzene ring (since the numbering starts at the connection point). In B, the benzene is written as cc(ccc12)Cl. Wait, that might actually be the same structure. The SMILES string can sometimes represent the same structure with different ordering, especially if the ring closures are numbered differently. \n\nAnother thing to check is the connectivity. In Molecule A, the structure is N(CCCN...) connected to the C(=O), while in B it's N(C(...)) connected to the C=O and then the propyl chain. Let me draw both structures mentally. \n\nIn A: The nitrogen is attached to methyl (C), the propyl chain (CCCN), and the carbonyl. The propyl chain is CH2CH2CH2N connected to the pyridine and benzene rings. \n\nIn B: The nitrogen is attached to methyl (C), the carbonyl group (C=O), and a propyl chain (CCN). Wait, no\u2014the B structure starts with C(N(...)), which is a methyl group attached to a nitrogen. The nitrogen has three substituents: the methyl (from the initial C), the carbonyl (C(=O)), and a propyl chain (CCN). Wait, CCN would be CH2CH2N? So the propyl chain is actually two carbons here? Because CCN would be -CH2-CH2-N-? Wait, no, let's parse the SMILES properly. The SMILES for B is C(N(...)C)CCN... So the nitrogen is connected to the methyl (C), the C(=O), and then the C-C-C-N group. So the chain is actually three carbons: the first C is part of the N-C(...), then CC (two more carbons), then N. So that's a propyl chain (three carbons) between the nitrogen and the next nitrogen. \n\nWait, let me break down the substituents on the central nitrogen in each molecule. In A: the nitrogen (N) has three groups: methyl (C), propyl (CCCN), and the carbonyl (C(=O)). In B: the nitrogen (N) has three groups: methyl (C), carbonyl (C(=O)), and propyl (CCN). Wait, propyl would be three carbons. Wait, CCCN is four carbons (but that's impossible, because the chain would be -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-N-?), but that would be a butyl group. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's see: in Molecule A, the substituent is CCCN. So the nitrogen is connected to a carbon chain that is three carbons long (CCCN would be N connected to a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group? No, because SMILES reads from left to right. Let's parse the substituent on the nitrogen in A: CN(CCCNc1...) So the nitrogen has a methyl (C), then a group that is CCCN... So the substituent is a propyl (three carbons) attached to another nitrogen? Wait, no. The CCCN is part of the substituent chain. Let me think: the nitrogen in A has three branches: C (methyl), CCCNc1... (a propyl chain ending in a nitrogen connected to the aromatic rings), and C(=O) connected to benzene.\n\nIn B, the nitrogen is part of C(N(...)C)CCN... So the nitrogen has substituents: the methyl (from the first C), the C(=O) (from N(C(...)=O)), and the C-C-C-N (propyl chain). Wait, the substituent here is CCNc1..., which would be a two-carbon chain (since it's C-C-N...). So that's ethyl, not propyl. Wait, that's a problem. If in A the chain is propyl (three carbons) and in B it's ethyl (two carbons), then they are different. \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused with the SMILES notation. Let me write out the structure step by step.\n\nMolecule A: CN(CCCNc1ccnc2cc(Cl)ccc12)C(=O)c1ccccc1\n\nThe central nitrogen is connected to:\n\n- A methyl group (C)\n- A group that starts with CCCN... (so the chain is C-C-C-C-N...)\n- A carbonyl group (C(=O)) attached to a benzene ring.\n\nSo the substituent chain is four carbons (but wait, CCCN is four carbons: C-C-C-C-N...? No, wait. The substituent is CCCN... which would be N connected to a three-carbon chain (C-C-C-) and then another N? Let me parse the entire substituent:\n\nThe substituent after the first N is CCCNc1ccnc2cc(Cl)ccc12. Breaking this down:\n\nCCCNc1... is a chain of three carbons (C-C-C-) connected to a nitrogen (N) which is connected to c1... (a pyridine ring). So the chain is propyl (three carbons) leading to a nitrogen, which is attached to a pyridine ring (c1ccnc...). Then the pyridine ring (c1ccnc2...) is connected to another benzene ring (c2cc(Cl)ccc12), with the chlorine in a certain position.\n\nMolecule B: C(N(C(c1ccccc1)=O)C)CCNc1ccnc2cc(ccc12)Cl\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first C is a methyl group attached to a nitrogen. The nitrogen has three substituents:\n\n1. The methyl (C)\n2. The carbonyl group (C(=O)) attached to a benzene ring (C(c1ccccc1)=O)\n3. A chain CCNc1... which is a two-carbon chain (C-C-) leading to a nitrogen (N) connected to the pyridine ring (c1ccnc2...). The pyridine ring is connected to a benzene ring (cc(ccc12)Cl), with the chlorine attached here.\n\nWait, so in Molecule A, the chain is three carbons (propyl) leading to the nitrogen attached to the rings. In Molecule B, the chain is two carbons (ethyl) leading to the nitrogen attached to the rings. That would mean the two molecules have different chain lengths, so they are different structures. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Let me check again.\n\nIn Molecule A, the substituent is CCCN. So the chain is four carbons (C-C-C-C-N...), but that would be a butyl chain. Wait, no. SMILES reads from left to right. The substituent on the nitrogen in A is written as CCCN..., which would be: the nitrogen is connected to a carbon chain that is C-C-C-C, then another N? Or is it that the substituent is a propylamine group? Let me think: The substituent on N is CCCN... So the N has a substituent that is a propyl (C-C-C-) connected to a nitrogen. Wait, that would be N-(CH2CH2CH2)-N...? But that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group (three carbons) ending in a nitrogen. So the chain is CH2CH2CH2N-... In that case, the chain is three carbons (propyl) leading to the nitrogen.\n\nIn Molecule B, the substituent is CCN... So the chain is two carbons (ethyl) leading to the nitrogen. So the chain in B is shorter by one carbon. That would make the molecules different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try to draw both substituents.\n\nFor Molecule A: The substituent after the central N is CCCNc1... So the structure would be:\n\nCentral N connected to a methyl (CH3), a carbonyl group (C=O attached to benzene), and a chain that is -CH2-CH2-CH2-N-... which connects to the pyridine ring. So the chain is three carbons (propyl) between the central N and the next N.\n\nIn Molecule B, the substituent after the central N is CCNc1... So the chain is -CH2-CH2-N-... (two carbons, ethyl) between the central N and the next N.\n\nTherefore, the chain lengths differ: three carbons vs. two carbons. This would mean the molecules are different, so the answer is No.\n\nAnother point to check is the position of the chlorine. In Molecule A, the benzene ring connected to the pyridine has chlorine at a certain position. In Molecule B, the same benzene ring is written as cc(ccc12)Cl. Depending on how the ring closures are numbered, the position might be the same or different. Let's compare:\n\nIn A: c2cc(Cl)ccc12. The benzene ring (c2) is connected to the pyridine (c1). The Cl is on position 4 (since the connections are positions 1 and 2, then the Cl is on position 4). In B: c2cc(ccc12)Cl. Wait, that's written as c2 connected to c, then cc(ccc12)Cl. Hmm, maybe the Cl is at position 5? Or maybe it's the same position. SMILES notation can have different ways of writing the same structure based on the order of atoms. However, the order of the substituents in the SMILES string affects the perceived position. If the Cl is in the same position in both molecules, then that part is the same. But if the ring closures are numbered differently, the positions might change. However, since the connectivity between the pyridine and benzene rings is the same (the two rings are connected in the same way), the Cl should be in the same position. So the difference would be in the chain length.\n\nTherefore, since the chain between the central nitrogen and the aromatic rings is three carbons in A and two carbons in B, the molecules are different. The answer is No.",

That's an ethyl group (CCO-) attached to a carbonyl oxygen (OC=O). Then there's a carbon chain CN1, which is part of a ring. The ring has a carbonyl group (C1=O) and another carbonyl attached to sulfur (SC(=O)...). The sulfur is connected to a carbon with a double bond to a carbon chain: C=Cc2ccc...

The substituent on the benzene ring is a para-dichlorobenzene attached via an oxygen. \n\nMolecule B's substituent on the benzene is a dichlorobenzene as well, but the oxygen is part of the ring (o in the benzene ring).

The ring includes a sulfur atom connected to a carbonyl (SC(=O)), which is connected to a C=C group. That C=C is attached to a benzene ring (c2ccc...) which has a substituent of another dichlorobenzene (-c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl) attached via an oxygen (o2). The ring in the nitrogen (C1=O) closes here.\n\nMolecule B's structure: The main benzene ring (Clc1cc...) has two Cl atoms. It's connected via a single bond (-c1oc(...)) to another benzene ring with an oxygen (o). The oxygen is attached to a C=C group which is part of a ring (C=C2SC(...)). The sulfur is in a ring with a carbonyl (C2=O) and a nitrogen (N(C2=O)...). The nitrogen is connected to a chain that includes an ethyl ester (CC(OCC)=O).\n\nWait, the substituent in Molecule B's benzene ring is a -c1oc(...) group. The 'oc' suggests an oxygen in the benzene ring, making it a furan or similar. But in SMILES notation, 'o' is an oxygen in a ring. So that part is a benzene ring with an oxygen? Wait, benzene rings are all carbons unless specified. So in Molecule B, the substituent is a ring where one of the atoms is oxygen. So perhaps a furan ring attached to the main benzene?\n\nBut looking back, the substituent in Molecule A's benzene is -c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl, which is a para-dichlorobenzene attached via a single bond. In Molecule B, the substituent is -c1oc(...), which is a ring (probably a furan) with substituents.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to check if the substituents are the same.

For example, different starting points or ring numbering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are tautomers or have different stereochemistry, but SMILES usually doesn't specify stereochemistry unless indicated, and there's no indication here of stereochemistry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES are written in different orders but the same structure.\n\nLet me try to parse both SMILES again.\n\nMolecule A:\n\nCCOC(=O)CN1C(=O)SC(=Cc2ccc(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl)o2)C1=O\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- Ethyl group (CCO-) connected to a carbonyl oxygen (O-C(=O)).\n- Then a carbon connected to nitrogen (CN1), which is part of a ring (1 being the ring closure).\n- The ring includes C(=O), S, and another C(=O) (since SC(=C... ) and C1=O).\n- The S is connected to a C(=C...), which is a double bond to a carbon attached to a benzene ring (c2...).\n- The benzene ring (c2ccc(...)o2) has an oxygen atom (o2), so it's a furan-like ring? Wait, c2 is a benzene ring (six carbons), but one of them is replaced by oxygen (o2). Wait, no\u2014SMILES uses lowercase letters for aromatic rings. So 'c' is aromatic carbon, 'o' is aromatic oxygen. So the ring c2ccc(...)o2 would be a five-membered ring? Because if it's c2 (which is a ring closure), but the atoms are c, c, c, ..., o. Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with an oxygen substituent, but that's not possible because benzene is six carbons. Wait, no\u2014if it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, that would be a pyran or similar, but aromatic oxygen is typically in five-membered rings like furan. Hmm, maybe the notation is incorrect, but let's try to parse.\n\nWait, the part in Molecule A: c2ccc(-c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl)o2. The 'o2' here suggests that the oxygen is part of the ring, making a five-membered ring. Because the ring closure is at position 2. So the ring would be: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Wait, but SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to indicate closures. Let me try to draw this.\n\nFor c2ccc(...)o2:\n\n- The 'c2' starts the ring, then three carbons (ccc), then a substituent (-c3...), then 'o2' closes the ring. Wait, that would create a five-membered ring: c2 (start), c, c, c, o2. So five atoms: positions 1 (c2), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (o2). That would make a five-membered ring with four carbons and one oxygen, like furan. But the substituent is attached to the fourth carbon (the third 'c' in ccc?), and the ring closure is between the first and fifth atoms (c2 and o2). So that's a five-membered ring, but the substituent is -c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl, which is a benzene ring with two Cl atoms. Wait, but that substituent would be attached to the fourth position of the five-membered ring.\n\nMeanwhile, Molecule B's structure: Clc1cc(ccc1-c1oc(C=C2SC(N(C2=O)CC(OCC)=O)=O)cc1)Cl\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- The main benzene ring is Clc1cc...cc1)Cl. So positions 1 and 4 (or similar) have Cl atoms.\n- The substituent is -c1oc(...) which is a ring (probably five-membered) with oxygen. The 'c1' starts a new ring, then o, then c(...), etc. The substituent on the oxygen ring is C=C2SC(...). The SC(...) is part of a ring closure (C2=O). The nitrogen is attached to the sulfur ring: N(C2=O)CC(OCC)=O.\n\nComparing the two, the main difference seems to be the arrangement of the rings and substituents. Molecule A has a five-membered ring (with oxygen) attached to a benzene ring with Cl substituents, while Molecule B has a main benzene ring with Cl substituents connected to another five-membered oxygen ring, which is attached to the sulfur-containing ring.\n\nWait, maybe they are actually the same molecule but written in different orders. Let me see:\n\nIn Molecule A, the substituent on the benzene ring (c2) is a five-membered ring with oxygen (o2) and a para-dichlorobenzene group (-c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl). The sulfur is part of a ring with the nitrogen and two carbonyl groups.\n\nIn Molecule B, the main benzene ring has Cl atoms and is connected to a five-membered oxygen ring (oc(...)), which is connected to a C=C group leading into a sulfur-containing ring (SC(N(...))=O). The nitrogen here is attached to an ethyl ester group (CC(OCC)=O).\n\nPutting this together, it's possible that both molecules have the same substituents but arranged differently in the SMILES string. However, SMILES is unique up to isomorphism, so if the connectivity is the same, the canonical SMILES would be identical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two SMILES are different representations of the same structure. For example, the ethyl ester group (OCC in Molecule B vs. CCO in Molecule A) is written in reverse. Wait, in Molecule A, it's CCOC(=O)..., which is ethyl oxycarbonyl (O=C-O-CC). In Molecule B, CC(OCC)=O would be O=C-O-CC, same as ethyl ester. So that part is the same.\n\nThe nitrogen in Molecule A is part of a ring: N1C(=O)SC(...)C1=O. So the nitrogen is connected to a carbonyl (C(=O)), then sulfur, then another carbonyl (C1=O). That forms a ring: N-C(=O)-S-C(=O)-... and back to N. Wait, but the exact connectivity would determine the ring structure. In Molecule B, the nitrogen is part of SC(N(C2=O)...)=O. So N is connected to C2=O (part of a ring), and the nitrogen is also connected to CC(OCC)=O (the ethyl ester).\n\nWait, perhaps the core rings are the same. Let's see:\n\nMolecule A's ring: N1C(=O)SC(=C...)C1=O. That would form a five-membered ring: N-C(=O)-S-C(=C...)-C(=O)-, but wait, the C1=O is the closure. So the ring is N-C(=O)-S-C(=C...)-C1=O and back to N. That's a five-membered ring: N, C=O, S, C(=C...), C=O.\n\nMolecule B's ring: C=C2SC(N(...))=O. The ring closure is at C2. So the ring would be C=C2-S-C-N(...)-C2=O. Wait, that's a four-membered ring? Because C=C2 connected to S, then to C (part of N(...)), then back to C2=O. That would be a four-membered ring: C=C-S-C(=O). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the ring is larger. Let me parse again.\n\nIn Molecule B: C=C2SC(N(C2=O)...)=O. The SC(N(...))=O part: S connected to C, which is connected to N. The N is attached to C2=O (ring closure). So the ring would be C2=O connected to N, which is connected to C, which is connected to S, which is connected to C=C2. So the ring is C2=C-S-C-N-C2=O. That's a five-membered ring: positions C2 (double bond), S, C, N, C2=O. So a five-membered ring with S and N.\n\nComparing to Molecule A's ring, which is N-C(=O)-S-C(=C...)-C(=O)- back to N. That's a five-membered ring with N, two carbonyls, S, and a substituted carbon.\n\nWait, the rings are different. Molecule A's ring has two carbonyl groups, while Molecule B's ring has a double bond (C=C) and a carbonyl. So the rings are not the same. Therefore, the two molecules are different.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Let me double-check.\n\nMolecule A's ring: positions N1, C(=O), S, C(=C...), C1=O. So the ring is N-C(=O)-S-C(=C...)-C(=O)-N. That's a five-membered ring with N, two carbonyls, S, and a substituted carbon.\n\nMolecule B's ring: C=C2-S-C-N-C(=O). So the ring is C=C-S-C-N-C(=O)-C=C (closing the ring at C2). Wait, that would be a five-membered ring as well. But the substituents are different. In Molecule A, the S is between two carbonyls, while in Molecule B, the S is between a C=C and a C connected to N.\n\nSo the rings are different. Therefore, the molecules are not the same.\n\nAnother point: the substituent on the benzene rings. In Molecule A, the benzene (from c2) is attached to a five-membered oxygen ring (o2) which is connected to the C=C and the sulfur ring. In Molecule B, the main benzene has Cls and is connected to a five-membered oxygen ring (oc(...)), which is connected to the C=C and sulfur ring.\n\nThe arrangement of the chlorine atoms might be different. In Molecule A, the substituent on the benzene (c2) is a para-dichlorobenzene (-c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl), meaning the Cls are on positions 1 and 4 of that benzene. In Molecule B, the main benzene has Cls on positions 1 and 4 (Clc1cc(ccc1...)), but the substituent is attached to position 3 (assuming the benzene is numbered from Cl at position 1, then positions 2, 3, 4 (another Cl?), but I need to parse the SMILES correctly.\n\nAlternatively, the Cl positions might be the same, but the overall connectivity of the substituents differs.\n\nGiven all these differences in the rings and substituent arrangements, I would conclude that the two molecules are not the same. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Molecule A is CC(NC(=O)C1CCN(Cc2cccc(NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)cc3)c2)CC1)C1CCCCC1, and Molecule B is C1CCCC(C1)C(C)NC(C1CCN(Cc2cc(ccc2)NC(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)=O)CC1)=O. \n\nFirst, I'll try to parse both SMILES to visualize their structures. Starting with Molecule A. The main chain seems to be a central carbon connected to an NC(=O) group. The carbonyl group (C=O) is attached to a cyclohexane ring (C1CCN...CC1). The nitrogen in the cyclohexane is connected to a benzyl group (Cc2cccc...c2), which has an aniline substituent (NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)cc3). The Cl is on the benzene ring at position para. Then, the main chain also has a cyclopentyl group (C1CCCCC1) attached to the central carbon.\n\nNow, Molecule B: The SMILES starts with C1CCCC(C1), which is a cyclopentane ring. Then there's a C(C) group attached to it. The NC(...)=O part indicates an amide. The carbonyl is connected to another cyclohexane ring (C1CCN...CC1). The nitrogen here is attached to a benzyl group (Cc2cc(ccc2)...). The benzyl's benzene has an NC(...)=O substituent, which connects to another benzene ring with Cl at the para position. \n\nWait, let me check the substituents. In Molecule A's benzyl group (c2cccc(NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)cc3)c2), the substituent is on position 4 if we count the ring. In Molecule B's benzyl group (Cc2cc(ccc2)NC(...)), the substituent NC is on position 3 maybe? Because the SMILES is c2cc(ccc2) which implies that the substituent is in the middle of the ring. Wait, the SMILES notation for benzene rings can be tricky. For example, c2ccc(Cl)cc3 would have the Cl in the para position. Let me break down the substituents.\n\nIn Molecule A's c2cccc(NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)cc3)c2: the benzene ring (c2cccc...) has the NC(=O) group attached. Let's number the positions. The SMILES starts with c2, then four c's, then the substituent. So positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. The substituent is after the fourth c, which would be position 4? Or maybe position 3? Wait, SMILES strings for rings can be written in any order, but the order affects the positions. Alternatively, maybe using a parser would help, but since I can't do that, I'll have to reason it out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that both molecules have the same substituents but arranged differently. For example, in Molecule B's benzyl group: Cc2cc(ccc2)NC(...)=O. The c2cc(ccc2) part would be a benzene ring where the substituents are in certain positions. Let's see: starting with c2, then cc(ccc2) \u2013 maybe positions 1,2, then a branching. Wait, perhaps the benzyl group in Molecule B has the NC(=O) substituent in a different position than in Molecule A. If the substituent positions differ, even if the substituents are the same, the molecules would be different.\n\nAnother point to check: the cyclopentyl group in Molecule A is C1CCCCC1 (which is a cyclohexane?) Wait, no. Wait, C1CCCCC1 would be a cyclohexane because there are six carbons in the ring. But wait, the SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to indicate the closure. So C1-C-C-C-C-C-1 would be cyclohexane. But in Molecule A, the substituent is C1CCCCC1, which is cyclohexane. However, in Molecule B, the substituent starts with C1CCCC(C1), which is a cyclopentane ring (five carbons) with a substituent on one carbon (the (C1) part). Wait, the SMILES for Molecule B starts with C1CCCC(C1)C(C)... So the first part is a cyclopentane (C1 connected to four Cs and then back to C1), and then there's a C(C) attached to it. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\nMolecule B: C1CCCC(C1)C(C)NC(...)=O. The first part is a cyclopentane (C1-C-C-C-C-C1), but the fifth carbon is connected to another C(C). Wait, no: the first part is C1 connected to C, then C, then C, then C, then C1. Wait, maybe it's a cyclopentane where one of the carbons is connected to a substituent. For example, C1CCCC(C1) would be a cyclopentane. Then, the next part is C(C) attached to that. Hmm, maybe the cyclopentane is part of a branching structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the main chain in Molecule B is a cyclopentane ring (C1CCCC(C1)) with a substituent (C(C)) attached. Then, the C(C) is connected to an NC group, which is connected to the cyclohexane ring and the amide.\n\nIn Molecule A, the substituent is a cyclohexane (C1CCCCC1) attached to the central carbon. So, if Molecule B has a cyclopentane substituent and Molecule A has a cyclohexane, that would make them different. Wait, wait, no. Let me check again: Molecule A's substituent is C1CCCCC1, which is cyclohexane (six-membered ring). Molecule B's substituent starts with C1CCCC(C1), which is a cyclopentane (five-membered ring) because it's C1 followed by four Cs and then closing to C1. So the rings are different sizes. That would mean the molecules are different. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the substituent positions.\n\nWait, in Molecule A, the structure is CC(...)C1CCCCC1. The central carbon (the first C) is connected to another C (the second C), then to the NC(=O) group, and also to the cyclohexane (C1CCCCC1). In Molecule B, the structure starts with C1CCCC(C1)C(C)NC(...)=O. The C1CCCC(C1) is a cyclopentane ring, then there's a C(C) attached to one of the carbons in the cyclopentane. Then, the C(C) is connected to NC(...)=O. So, in Molecule A, the substituent is a cyclohexane, while in Molecule B, it's a cyclopentane with a methyl branch (C(C)). Wait, no, the substituent in B is C(C), which is a methyl group (since it's C attached to another C). So, in Molecule B, the substituent is a cyclopentane attached to a methyl group (C(C)), whereas in Molecule A, the substituent is a cyclohexane. So that part is different. Therefore, the molecules would not be the same.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the benzyl groups: in Molecule A, the benzyl has the substituent NC(=O) attached to a benzene ring (c3ccc(Cl)cc3) which is para-chlorophenyl. In Molecule B, the benzyl group is Cc2cc(ccc2)NC(...)=O. The benzene ring here is c2cc(ccc2), which would have the substituent NC(=O) in a different position. Let's see: the SMILES for the benzyl in B is Cc2cc(ccc2)NC(...). Breaking down c2cc(ccc2): starting at position 1, then position 2 is a carbon connected to another carbon, then a branch (ccc2). Wait, perhaps the benzene ring in B is written as positions 1,2, then a branch that connects to positions 3,4,5, and back to 2? Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the benzene ring in B's benzyl group is substituted at position 3, whereas in A it's substituted at position 4. If the substituents are in different positions on the benzene ring, that would make them different molecules (structural isomers).\n\nSo, combining these two differences: the cyclo substituent (cyclohexane vs. cyclopentane with methyl) and the substituent positions on the benzyl group's benzene ring, the two molecules are not the same. Therefore, the answer should be No.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to determine if Molecule A and Molecule B are the same based on their SMILES strings. Let me start by recalling that SMILES strings can represent the same molecule in different ways due to the order of atoms or branching. But sometimes, differences in the SMILES can indicate actual structural differences.\n\nFirst, I'll look at both SMILES closely. Molecule A is O=C(NC(Cc1ccccc1)c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1)c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1. Molecule B is C(C(c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2)NC(=O)c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O)c1ccccc1.\n\nI'll try to parse each part. Let's break down Molecule A. The core seems to be an amide group (O=C(N...)) attached to something. The NC(...) part suggests a urea linkage. The substituents attached to the nitrogen might be a benzyl group (from Cc1ccccc1) and a heterocyclic ring. The heterocycle is c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1, which looks like a quinoline or isoquinoline structure. The other part is a benzene ring with a nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) in the para position (c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1).\n\nNow Molecule B: Starting with C(...), which is a carbon connected to a larger structure. The substituents here are C(c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2) which is similar to the heterocycle in A, but the arrangement might differ. Then there's NC(=O)c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O, which is the nitrobenzene part attached to the amide. The rest is another benzene ring (c1ccccc1).\n\nWait, let me compare the connectivity. In Molecule A, the amide is O=C(N...), where the nitrogen is connected to a benzyl group (C(Cc1ccccc1)) and the heterocycle. In Molecule B, the structure starts with a central carbon connected to the heterocycle (C(c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2)), then the amide group (NC(=O)...) attached to that. The nitro group is in the same position on the benzene ring.\n\nBut I need to check if the branching is the same. In SMILES notation, the order of branches can vary, but the actual structure depends on the connectivity. Let me try to draw both structures mentally.\n\nMolecule A: The central part is the amide (O=C-N). The nitrogen has two substituents: one is a carbon attached to a benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1), and the other is a heterocyclic ring (c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1). The carbonyl is attached to another benzene ring with a nitro group.\n\nWait, no. Let's parse the SMILES correctly. The SMILES for A is O=C(NC(...)c1...) where the NC(...) is part of the substituents. Wait, maybe I should parse the entire string step by step.\n\nMolecule A: O=C(NC(Cc1ccccc1)c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1)c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main chain starts with the carbonyl group O=C.\n- The carbonyl is attached to a nitrogen (N), which has two substituents: a carbon (C) and another part (c1nc2...).\n- The substituent C is connected to a benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1), so that's a CH2 connected to benzene.\n- The other substituent on the N is the heterocyclic ring: c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1. This is a ring where positions 1 and 2 are nitrogen? Let me see: the ring is written as c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1. So the first ring (ring 1) starts with a carbon (c1), then a nitrogen (n), then a c2 which starts another ring (ring 2). The ring 2 is cccc, so benzene. Then back to ring 1 with [nH]1. So the heterocycle is a bicyclic system. Wait, maybe it's a 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps a quinoline-like structure but with two nitrogens? Alternatively, it's a five-membered ring fused to a benzene. Let me count the atoms. The first ring (ring1) is written as c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1. So starting at c1 (atom1), then n (atom2), c2 (atom3), which starts ring2 (positions 3,4,5,6,7,8?), but perhaps it's a fused ring. Wait, the ring closure for ring1 is at [nH]1, so the first ring has atoms 1 (c), 2 (n), 3 (c from c2), then ring2 is c c c c c (so six members?), but maybe it's a fused ring where ring2 is a benzene attached to the first ring. Hmm, maybe the heterocycle is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. Let's see: the first ring (ring1) is atoms 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C), 4 (C from ring2?), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the heterocycle could be a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. Wait, perhaps the SMILES notation is for a bicyclic system where the two rings are fused. For example, if the first ring is a five-membered ring (positions 1,2,3,4,5), and the second ring is a six-membered benzene. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the heterocycle is a benzimidazole or similar. Wait, no. Let's try to count the atoms in the first ring. The first ring (ring1) starts at position 1 (c1), then n, then c2 (which is part of ring2). Ring2 is c c c c c c (six members?), then after that, back to ring1 with [nH]1. So ring1 has atoms 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C connected to ring2), then after ring2 is processed, we have [nH]1. So ring1 must be a three-membered ring? That can't be. Wait, SMILES notation allows for branching with parentheses. Let me try again.\n\nThe SMILES for the heterocycle in A is c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1. So atom 1 is a carbon (c1), followed by a nitrogen (n), then a carbon (c2) which starts ring2. Ring2 is c c c c c (so five members?), but then there's a closure for ring2 (the 2 in c2?), but the ring2 is written as c2ccccc2. Wait, no: c2ccccc2 would be six members (c followed by five c's and closure as 2). So ring2 is a benzene ring (six members). Then back to ring1 with [nH]1. So ring1 is a six-membered ring? Let's see: the sequence is c1 (1), n (2), c2 (3), then after processing ring2 (which is c c c c c c, positions 3-8?), but then [nH]1 (back to position1). Wait, maybe the ring1 has atoms 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C), then positions 4,5,6,7,8 from ring2, and then back to position1. That would make ring1 a 8-membered ring, which is unlikely. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to look at the actual structure. Alternatively, perhaps the heterocycle is a indole-like structure but with an extra nitrogen. Alternatively, maybe it's a pyrrole fused to a benzene, but with a nitrogen in the pyrrole ring. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is written in a way that creates a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. For example, if the first ring is c1n... then after processing ring2, which is benzene, and then back to [nH]1. Let me try to draw it step by step:\n\nAtom 1: c1\nAtom 2: n (connected to atom1)\nAtom 3: c2 (connected to atom2)\nThen, ring2 starts: c (atom4), c (5), c (6), c (7), c (8), c2 (atom3). Wait, but c2 is the closure for ring2. So ring2 is six-membered: atoms 3 (c2),4,5,6,7,8, and back to 3. So that's a benzene ring. Then, after that, we have [nH]1 (atom9?), connected back to ring1's closure (1). So ring1 would be atoms 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C connected to ring2), and then after processing ring2, we have [nH]1. So ring1's closure is from atom9 (the [nH]) back to atom1. Wait, that would make ring1 a three-membered ring: 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C), then from 3 to ring2's benzene, then after ring2, we have the [nH] connected to 1. That would make a three-membered ring, which is impossible. I must be misunderstanding the notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES is written with nested rings. Let me try again. The SMILES is c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1. So, starting at c1 (atom1), followed by n (atom2), then c2 (atom3), then c (atom4), c (5), c (6), c (7), c (8), then closing ring2 with c2 (atom3), so the ring2 is atoms 3-8: c (3), c (4), c (5), c (6), c (7), c (8), forming a benzene ring. Then, back to ring1: [nH]1 (atom9), which closes the ring back to atom1. So ring1 is atom1 (C), atom2 (N), atom3 (C), then atom9 (N with H) connected back to atom1. That would form a five-membered ring? Wait, no. If ring1 is 1,2,3,9, and then? Wait, maybe the ring1 is 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C connected to ring2), then after processing ring2, we have [nH]1, which is another N connected to ring1's closure. So ring1 would be 1 (C) connected to 2 (N), which is connected to 3 (C), which is part of ring2. Then after ring2's benzene, we have [nH]1 (atom9), which connects back to atom1, forming a ring of 1-2-3-9-1? That would make a four-membered ring, which is possible but strained. But this seems unlikely. Perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the SMILES is actually representing a fused ring system. Let me think of indole: the indole structure is a benzene ring fused to a pyrrole. The SMILES for indole is c1ccc2c(c1)cc[nH]2. So maybe the heterocycle here is similar but with an extra nitrogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzimidazole, which has two nitrogens in the five-membered ring. Let's see: benzimidazole's SMILES would be c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c(n2). Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the structure here is a quinoline with an additional nitrogen. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pyrrole ring fused to a benzene, with one N in the pyrrole and another in the benzene? I'm not sure, but maybe I can move forward by comparing the two SMILES.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES is C(C(c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2)NC(=O)c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O)c1ccccc1. Let's parse this. Starting from the first C, which is connected to another C. The substituents on that C are:\n\n- C(c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2): a carbon connected to a heterocycle similar to A's. Let's look at c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2. Starting with c1 (atom1), n (atom2), c2 (atom3), c (atom4) which has a substituent [nH]1 (so atom5 is N with H, connected back to ring1 closure). Then cccc2 (ring2 closure). So ring1 is atoms1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C), 5 (N). Then ring2 is atoms3 (C),4 (C), followed by cccc2, which would be atoms6,7,8,9, closing back to atom3. Wait, this is confusing. Let's try:\n\nThe heterocycle in B is c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2. So:\n\n- Start with c1 (atom1).\n- Then n (atom2).\n- Then c2 (atom3), which starts ring2.\n- Then c (atom4) with a substituent [nH]1 (which is atom5, a nitrogen connected to ring1's closure (atom1)).\n- Then c (atom6), c (7), c (8), c (9), closing ring2 with c2 (atom3).\n\nSo ring2 is atoms3 (C),4 (C with substituent),6,7,8,9. Wait, but the substituent on atom4 is [nH]1, which is connected back to atom1. So ring1 is atom1 (C), atom2 (N), atom3 (C), and then the substituent on atom4 is connected to atom1 via [nH]1. So ring1 would be a three-membered ring (C-N-C), which is not possible. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES is indicating a fused ring system where ring1 and ring2 are fused. For example, ring1 is a five-membered ring with atoms1,2,3,5, and another atom, and ring2 is a six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. For example, starting at c1, n, c2, then a substituent [nH]1 (atom5 connected back to c1), forming a five-membered ring: 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C), 4 (C?), and 5 (N). But I'm not sure. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for other differences between the two SMILES.\n\nIn Molecule A, the nitro group is on a benzene ring written as c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1. That's a benzene ring with substituents in positions 1, 4 (since the SMILES is c1cccc(...)c1). Wait, SMILES notation: the order is sequential. So for c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1, the benzene ring is written as starting with c1, then four carbons (positions 2,3,4,5), then the nitro group at position6 (since the last c1 closes the ring). Wait, no. The SMILES for benzene is usually c1ccccc1, where each 'c' is a position. So in this case, c1 (1), c (2), c (3), c (4), c (5), then [N+]... at position5, and closing with c1 (6). Wait, no. Let me parse the SMILES correctly. The SMILES is c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1. Breaking it down:\n\n- c1: start of ring1.\n- c: position2.\n- c: position3.\n- c: position4.\n- c: position5, which has a substituent [N+](=O)[O-].\n- c1: closure to position1. So the benzene ring has the nitro group at position5. That's the meta position relative to the point of attachment? Wait, the attachment point is where the benzene is connected to the rest of the molecule. Let's see, the main chain in A is O=C(NC(...))c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1. So the benzene ring with nitro is attached via the carbonyl group (O=C). The benzene ring has nitro at position5, which would be para to position1 (since in SMILES, the first c is position1, then positions 2-6 follow). So if the benzene is attached at position1 (since the rest is c1cccc(...)c1), then the nitro is at position5, which is two positions away (meta) from position1. Wait, no: in a benzene ring, position1 is connected to the rest of the molecule. Then positions 2,3,4,5,6 go around. So if the nitro is at position5, that's para to position1? Wait, no. Position1 is the attachment point. Position2 is adjacent (ortho), position3 is meta, position4 is para. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with numbering. Let me think: if the benzene is attached at position1, then positions 2 (ortho), 3 (meta), 4 (para), 5 (meta), 6 (ortho). So if the nitro is at position5, that's meta to the attachment point at position1. Wait, but in the SMILES c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1, the positions are 1 (attachment), 2,3,4,5 (nitro), 6 (closure back to 1). So the nitro is at position5, which is two carbons away from position1 (since 1-2-3-4-5: that's four steps from 1 to 5?), which would make it para. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1 (attachment), 2 (ortho), 3 (meta), 4 (para), 5 (meta), 6 (ortho). So position5 is meta to position1. Therefore, the nitro group is meta to the point where the benzene is attached to the carbonyl group.\n\nIn Molecule B, the nitro group is part of the benzene ring written as c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O. Let's parse that: c1 starts the ring, then two carbons (positions2 and3), then a branch ( which is ccc1: positions4,5,6, closing back to position1. Wait, no. The SMILES is c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O. So:\n\n- c1 (position1)\n- c (position2)\n- c (position3)\n- ( branch: c (position4), c (5), c (6), closing to position1 (c1)\n- So the main chain is positions1-2-3, then a branch from position3 to positions4-5-6-1. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, the SMILES is c1cc(ccc1)[N+](...)=O. So the benzene ring is written as positions1 (start), position2, position3, then a branch at position3 which is ccc1 (positions4,5,6, back to 1), making a benzene ring. So the nitro group is attached at position3. Because after the branch, we have [N+](...)=O. So the nitro is at position3. Therefore, in Molecule B, the nitro group is at position3 of the benzene ring, which is meta to the attachment point (position1). Wait, but if the benzene is attached at position1, then position3 is meta. So both A and B have the nitro group in the meta position relative to the attachment point? Or no?\n\nWait, in A's nitro benzene: c1cccc([N+])c1. The nitro is at position5. In B's nitro benzene: c1cc(ccc1)[N+], which is attached at position3. So the positions are different. Therefore, the nitro groups are in different positions on the benzene rings. That would mean the molecules are different.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. In A, the nitro is at position5 of the benzene attached to the carbonyl. In B, the nitro is at position3 of the benzene attached to the amide. If the positions are different, then the molecules are not the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the SMILES. Let me check again.\n\nFor Molecule A's nitro benzene: O=C(...)c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1. The benzene is written as c1 (position1), then four c's (positions2,3,4,5), followed by the nitro group at position5, then c1 (position6) closing the ring. So positions1-2-3-4-5-6-1. Nitro at position5. So attachment is at position1 (connected to the carbonyl), nitro at position5, which is two carbons away from position1 (positions1-2-3-4-5: four steps around the ring, which in benzene's six-membered ring would be para position. Because in benzene, para is two carbons away (1 and 4), but wait, if you go from 1 to 2 (ortho), 3 (meta), 4 (para). So position5 would be three steps from 1 (positions1-2-3-4-5), which would be meta. Wait, this is confusing. Let me number the benzene ring in order:\n\nPosition1 (attachment), position2 (ortho), position3 (meta), position4 (para), position5 (meta), position6 (ortho). So in A, the nitro is at position5, which is meta to position1. In B's nitro benzene: c1cc(ccc1)[N+...]. The benzene is written as positions1 (attachment), position2, position3, then a branch starting at position3: ccc1 (positions4,5,6, back to 1). Then the nitro is attached at position3. So the nitro is at position3, which is meta to the attachment point. So both nitro groups are meta? Then they are in the same position. Wait, but in A, the nitro is at position5, which is meta, and in B, at position3, which is also meta. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so positions3 and5 are equivalent if the attachment is at position1. Because in a benzene ring, positions3 and5 are both meta to position1. So perhaps the nitro group is in the same position but written differently in the SMILES due to the way the SMILES is written. Because SMILES can start numbering from any position, leading to different representations of the same structure.\n\nWait, but SMILES strings can vary based on the starting point and direction. For example, a nitro group in the para position can be written as c1ccc(cc1)[N+]=O or c1cc([N+]=O)ccc1, etc. So if the nitro is in the same relative position but the SMILES is written with different numbering, they could be the same. But in this case, both nitro groups are in the meta position relative to the attachment point. However, the attachment points themselves might be different, leading to different positions. Wait, no. If the benzene is attached to the carbonyl group in both cases, then the nitro being meta in both would mean they're the same. But I need to check if the nitro is actually in the same position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attachment point in B's nitro benzene is different. Let's look again. In Molecule B, the nitro benzene is part of NC(=O)c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O. The NC(=O) is attached to the benzene ring. The benzene is c1cc(ccc1)[N+]... So the attachment is at position1 of the benzene, and the nitro is at position3. In Molecule A, the attachment is also at position1, nitro at position5. But in a benzene ring, position3 and5 are both meta to position1. Wait, no. Position1 is the attachment. Position2 is ortho, position3 is meta, position4 is para, position5 is meta again, position6 is ortho. So nitro at position3 and position5 are both meta, but they are different positions. However, benzene is symmetric, so a nitro group at position3 and position5 would be equivalent if the ring is symmetric. Wait, but nitro is a meta director. However, in a benzene ring, positions3 and5 are not equivalent unless there's a plane of symmetry. For example, if there's another substituent that makes them equivalent, but in this case, the only substituents are the nitro and the attachment point. So without other substituents, nitro at position3 or5 would be different unless the molecule has symmetry. Wait, but if the benzene ring is attached to the rest of the molecule at position1, and the nitro is at position3 or5, those are different positions. Because the benzene ring isn't symmetric enough to make them identical. Unless there's a mirror plane. But in a monosubstituted benzene with a single substituent, the positions are considered different unless there's another substituent that creates symmetry. So nitro at position3 vs.5 would be different molecules. Wait, no. For a monosubstituted benzene, positions3 and5 are equivalent because of the ring's symmetry. For example, toluene (methyl at position1), the meta positions are 3 and5, which are equivalent due to the ring's symmetry. So if the nitro is at either 3 or5, it's the same molecule. Because rotating the ring would make them identical. So in that case, the nitro positions in A and B are the same.\n\nBut wait, in SMILES notation, the numbering can vary, but the actual structure is the same. So if in A the nitro is at position5 and in B at position3, but they are meta to the attachment point, they are the same because of the ring's symmetry. Therefore, the nitro positions are the same.\n\nIf that's the case, then the difference in SMILES notation for the nitro's position doesn't matter; they represent the same structure.\n\nNow, moving on to the rest of the molecules. Let's check the heterocyclic rings. In A, the heterocycle is c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1. In B, it's c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2. Let's see if these represent the same structure.\n\nIn A's heterocycle: c1 (atom1), n (atom2), c2 (atom3), then ring2 (ccccc2), then [nH]1 (atom9) closing back to atom1. This forms a fused ring system. Let's imagine it's a five-membered ring fused to a six-membered ring. For example, a pyrrole ring (five-membered) fused to a benzene (six-membered). The five-membered ring would have two nitrogens: one at atom2 and another at atom9 (the [nH]1). The benzene ring (six-membered) is formed by c2 (atom3) and the subsequent carbons.\n\nIn B's heterocycle: c1 (atom1), n (atom2), c2 (atom3), then a branch starting with c (atom4) which has a substituent [nH]1 (atom5), then cccc2 (closing ring2). So the heterocycle is c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2. Let's parse this:\n\n- c1 starts ring1.\n- n (atom2) connected to c1.\n- c2 (atom3) starts ring2.\n- c (atom4) is part of ring2 and has a substituent [nH]1 (atom5), which connects back to ring1's closure (atom1).\n- Then c (atom6), c (7), c (8), c (9), closing ring2 with c2 (atom3).\n\nSo ring1 is atoms1 (C),2 (N),3 (C),5 (N). Wait, but that would form a four-membered ring (1-2-3-5-1?), which is unlikely. Alternatively, the [nH]1 is part of ring1, making a five-membered ring. For example, atom1 (C), atom2 (N), atom3 (C), atom4 (C), atom5 (N), closing back to atom1. Then ring2 is a benzene ring fused to the five-membered ring. This might form a structure like indole, but with an extra nitrogen. Alternatively, it could be a benzimidazole if there are two nitrogens in the five-membered ring.\n\nComparing the two heterocycles: in A, the SMILES is c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1, and in B, c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2. Are these the same structure? Let's try to write them differently.\n\nIn A: the five-membered ring (if that's what it is) has nitrogens at positions2 and5 (assuming the ring is 1 (C),2 (N),3 (C),4 (C),5 (N)), fused to a benzene ring (positions3,6,7,8,9,10). In B, the five-membered ring would have nitrogens at positions2 and5 (atom1: C, atom2: N, atom3: C, atom4: C with substituent [nH]1 (atom5: N), forming a five-membered ring. Then fused to a benzene (positions3,6,7,8,9,10). So the structures seem similar. The difference in SMILES could be due to the order of writing the rings or branching. The actual connectivity might be the same. For example, in A, the [nH]1 is at the end, while in B, it's in a branch. But if the connectivity is the same, then the structures are identical.\n\nAnother way to check is to canonicalize both SMILES. If they canonicalize to the same string, then they are the same. However, since I can't run a canonicalization algorithm here, I need to reason it out.\n\nAssuming both heterocycles are fused rings with two nitrogens in the five-membered ring and fused to a benzene, they would be the same structure. The different SMILES strings could be due to different starting points or branch orders.\n\nNow, checking the rest of the molecules. In Molecule A, the amide is O=C(NC(Cc1ccccc1)c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1). The NC(...) part indicates that the nitrogen is connected to a benzyl group (C(Cc1ccccc1)) and the heterocycle. In Molecule B, the structure starts with C(...), which is a carbon connected to the heterocycle (C(c1nc2...)) and the amide group (NC(=O)...). The benzyl group (c1ccccc1) is attached to the central carbon.\n\nWait, in Molecule A, the nitrogen of the amide is connected to two groups: one is the benzyl-containing carbon (C(Cc1ccccc1)), and the other is the heterocycle (c1nc2...). In Molecule B, the nitrogen is part of the amide (NC(=O)), and the central carbon is connected to the heterocycle and the benzyl group.\n\nWait, this is critical. Let me clarify the connectivity:\n\nIn Molecule A: The amide is O=C-N(C(Cc1ccccc1))(c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1). So the nitrogen has two substituents: a carbon (which is connected to a benzyl group) and the heterocyclic ring.\n\nIn Molecule B: The structure starts with C(C(...)) where the central carbon is connected to:\n\n- The heterocycle (C(c1nc2...))\n- The benzyl group (c1ccccc1)\n- And another substituent, which is NC(=O)c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O.\n\nWait, the B structure is: C(C(...))c1ccccc1. The central carbon is connected to three groups:\n\n1. The heterocycle (C(c1nc2...))\n2. The benzyl group (c1ccccc1)\n3. The amide group (NC(=O)...)\n\nWait, no. Let me parse the entire SMILES for B: C(C(c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2)NC(=O)c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O)c1ccccc1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main structure is C(...)c1ccccc1. The central carbon (let's call it C0) is connected to:\n\n   a. A branch: C(c1nc2c([nH]1)cccc2) \u2014 this is a carbon (C1) attached to the heterocycle.\n\n   b. Another branch: NC(=O)c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O \u2014 this is the amide group attached to C0.\n\n   c. The benzene ring c1ccccc1 \u2014 attached to C0.\n\nSo the central carbon C0 has three substituents:\n\n- C1 (connected to heterocycle)\n\n- NC(=O)... (amide)\n\n- Benzene ring.\n\nBut wait, in SMILES notation, each atom's bonds are listed in order. The central carbon C0 is written as C(...), where the branches are inside the parentheses. So the structure is C( [C(c1nc2...)] [NC(=O)...] )c1ccccc1. That implies that C0 is connected to three groups: the heterocycle-bearing carbon (C1), the amide group (N...), and the benzene ring (c1ccccc1).\n\nBut in Molecule A, the amide nitrogen is connected to a carbon (which is connected to benzyl) and the heterocycle. The carbonyl is attached to the nitrobenzene.\n\nIn Molecule B, the amide is part of the NC(=O) group attached to the central carbon (C0), which also holds the heterocycle and benzyl group. The nitrobenzene is attached to the amide's carbonyl.\n\nWait, no. In B, the amide is NC(=O)c1cc(ccc1)[N+]([O-])=O. So the amide's nitrogen is connected to the central carbon C0, and the carbonyl is connected to the nitrobenzene.\n\nIn A, the amide is O=C(N...)(c1...) where the nitrogen is connected to the benzyl-containing carbon and the heterocycle. The carbonyl is connected to the nitrobenzene.\n\nWait, this suggests that the connectivity is different. In A, the amide is:\n\nO=C(N(substituents))(nitrobenzene).\n\nIn B, the amide is part of a branch attached to the central carbon, which also holds the heterocycle and benzyl group. The nitrobenzene is attached to the amide's carbonyl.\n\nSo the overall connectivity is different. Let me try to draw both structures.\n\nMolecule A:\n\n- The central part is an amide: O=C-NR1R2, where R1 is a benzyl group (via a CH2 group) and R2 is the heterocyclic ring. The carbonyl is attached to a nitrobenzene.\n\nWait, no. The SMILES is O=C(NC(...)c1nc2...)c1cccc([N+]...). So the carbonyl group is connected to two groups: the nitrogen (N...) and the nitrobenzene (c1cccc...). So the structure is:\n\nCarbonyl (O=C) connected to:\n\n- Nitrogen (N) which has two substituents: a carbon (C(Cc1ccccc1)) and the heterocycle (c1nc2...).\n\n- Nitrobenzene (c1cccc...).\n\nSo the amide is R-N-C(=O)-Ar (where Ar is nitrobenzene).\n\nMolecule B:\n\n- The central carbon (C0) is connected to:\n\n   - A carbon (C1) which is connected to the heterocycle.\n\n   - An amide group (N-C(=O)-Ar, where Ar is nitrobenzene).\n\n   - A benzyl group (c1ccccc1).\n\nSo the structure is C(C1)(NC(=O)Ar)(benzyl).\n\nComparing the two structures:\n\nIn A, the amide's nitrogen is connected to the benzyl-containing carbon and the heterocycle, with the carbonyl attached to nitrobenzene.\n\nIn B, the central carbon is connected to the heterocycle, benzyl, and the amide's nitrogen. The carbonyl of the amide is attached to nitrobenzene.\n\nTherefore, the connectivity is different. In A, the benzyl group and heterocycle are substituents on the amide's nitrogen. In B, the benzyl group and heterocycle are substituents on a central carbon, which is also connected to the amide's nitrogen.\n\nThis indicates that the two molecules have different structures. The core connectivity differs: in A, the benzyl and heterocycle are on the nitrogen of the amide, while in B, they are on a central carbon connected to the amide's nitrogen.\n\nTherefore, the two molecules are not the same. The answer should be \"No\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Let's start by looking at Molecule A: CSc1nc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)c(-c2ccnc(OC(C)C)c2)[nH]1. And Molecule B: n1ccc(-c2[nH]c(SC)nc2-c2ccc(cc2)F)cc1OC(C)C.\n\nFirst, I remember that SMILES can sometimes represent the same structure in different ways due to the starting point or the order of branches. So maybe these are the same but written differently. Let me try to parse both.\n\nStarting with Molecule A. The main ring is a 1H-imidazole or similar. Let's break it down. The SMILES starts with CS (so a methylthio group attached to a nitrogen?), then c1nc(...)c(...)[nH]1. The first substituent is -c2ccc(F)cc2, which is a fluorophenyl group. The second substituent is -c2ccnc(OC(C)C)c2. That part has a chain where there's a phenyl ring with a cyano group (cn) and an ether OC(C)C (which is isopropoxy). So the substituents on the central ring are fluorophenyl and a substituted phenyl with isopropoxy attached via a cyano group?\n\nNow Molecule B: n1ccc(...)cc1OC(C)C. The main ring here is a pyridine? Because it starts with n1ccc... So the main ring is a six-membered aromatic ring with a nitrogen. Then there's a substituent: -c2[nH]c(SC)nc2-c2ccc(cc2)F. That part seems like another ring. Let's see: c2[nH]c(SC)nc2 would be a five-membered ring with two nitrogens, one with an SC group (methylthio again), and the other NH. Then connected via a single bond to a fluorophenyl group (ccc(cc2)F). Then the main pyridine ring has an OC(C)C group attached.\n\nWait, maybe the main structures are different. Molecule A's central ring is a five-membered ring (since the numbering is c1nc...c...nH1), so a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. Molecule B's main ring is a six-membered (n1ccc...cc1), which is a pyridine. So if the core rings are different (five-membered vs six-membered), then the molecules are different. But maybe I'm misreading the SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting point of the SMILES is different. Let me try to draw both.\n\nFor Molecule A: The central ring is 1H-imidazole-2-thiol (since CSc1...). The substituents on the imidazole ring are at positions 2 and 4 (assuming the ring is numbered starting from the S). Wait, the central ring is written as c1nc(...)c(...)[nH]1. The first atom is the S attached to C (methylthio group), then the ring starts at position 1 (the first carbon after S). So the ring is five-membered: positions 1 (C connected to S), 2 (N), 3 (C connected to fluorophenyl), 4 (C connected to the other substituent), and 5 (NH). So the substituents are on positions 3 and 4 of the imidazole ring.\n\nFor Molecule B: The main ring is n1ccc(...)cc1OC(C)C. The ring starts with a nitrogen (n1), then three carbons (ccc), a substituent (-c...), then two more carbons (cc1), with the O(C(C)C) group attached to one of them. So that's a pyridine ring (six-membered, one N) with substituents. The substituent is a group that has a five-membered ring (c2[nH]c(SC)nc2) connected to a fluorophenyl. Wait, the substituent here is a benzene ring? Let me parse the substituent: -c2[nH]c(SC)nc2-c2ccc(cc2)F. The first part is a five-membered ring: c2 connected to [nH], then c(SC), then n, then c2 again. So positions 1 (C connected to the main pyridine), 2 (NH), 3 (C with SC group), 4 (N), and back to 1? Wait, that would make a five-membered ring: C (position 1) connected to NH (position 2), then C (SC) (position 3), then N (position 4), then another C (position 5) connected back to position 1? Hmm, maybe it's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. The substituent on the main pyridine is this five-membered ring (imidazole?), which is connected via a single bond to a fluorophenyl group (-c2ccc(cc2)F). Also, the main pyridine has an isopropoxy group (OC(C)C) attached.\n\nComparing the two molecules:\n\nMolecule A has a central five-membered ring (imidazole-like) with substituents: fluorophenyl and another substituted phenyl. The substituents are attached to the imidazole ring.\n\nMolecule B has a central six-membered ring (pyridine) with substituents: a complex group (which includes an imidazole ring connected to fluorophenyl) and an isopropoxy group.\n\nSo the core rings are different (five-membered vs. six-membered), and the substituents are arranged differently. Therefore, they are not the same molecule.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Let me check again.\n\nAnother approach: Canonicalize both SMILES. If the canonical SMILES are the same, then the molecules are the same. However, since I can't compute that here, I have to rely on structural analysis.\n\nMolecule A's structure:\n\n- Central ring: five-membered, with two nitrogens. Positions 2 and 5 are nitrogens (assuming the SMILES is written as CSc1n...). The substituents are at positions 3 and 4.\n\n- Substituents: fluorophenyl (position 3) and a phenyl ring with a cyano group and isopropoxy (position 4).\n\nMolecule B's structure:\n\n- Central ring: pyridine (six-membered, one nitrogen) with substituents. The substituent is a group that has an imidazole ring (five-membered with two nitrogens) connected to fluorophenyl. The other substituent is isopropoxy on the pyridine.\n\nSo the main difference is the central ring. Molecule A's core is a five-membered ring, while Molecule B's core is a six-membered ring.

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to determine if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. Molecule A is CCn1ncc(C2=NOC(C(=O)Nc3cccc(C(C)=O)c3)C2)c1C, and Molecule B is O1C(C(=O)Nc2cc(C(=O)C)ccc2)CC(c2c(n(CC)nc2)C)=N1.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse both SMILES to understand their structures. SMILES can sometimes be tricky because the order of atoms and the ring numbering might differ, but the actual structure could be the same. Let's break them down.\n\nStarting with Molecule A: CCn1ncc(C2=NOC(C(=O)Nc3cccc(C(C)=O)c3)C2)c1C. Let's parse this step by step. The first part is CC, which is an ethyl group attached to a nitrogen. The n1 indicates a nitrogen in a ring. The ring has positions 1 (N), then another n (which is part of the ring?), followed by cc. Then there's a substituent at position C2=NOC(...). The C2 refers to a ring closure here. The part inside the parentheses for C2 is NOC(C(=O)Nc3cccc(C(C)=O)c3). So, there's an oxygen connected to a C, which has a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to an N that's attached to a benzene ring (c3cccc...). The benzene ring has a substituent C(C)=O, which is an acetyl group.\n\nNow, Molecule B: O1C(C(=O)Nc2cc(C(=O)C)ccc2)CC(c2c(n(CC)nc2)C)=N1. Let's parse this. The O1 suggests an oxygen in a ring. The C adjacent to O1 has a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to N, which is attached to a benzene ring (c2cc...). The benzene ring here has a substituent C(=O)C, which is also an acetyl group. Then there's CC connecting to another part: c2c(n(CC)nc2)C. This part seems like a ring with two nitrogens, similar to the first molecule. The =N1 at the end closes the ring with the O1, forming a ring with O and N connected via a double bond?\n\nComparing the two, I need to check if the structures are the same but just written in different orders or with different ring numbering. Let's look at the core rings. Molecule A has a ring with two nitrogens (the n1ncc part), which is a five-membered ring? Wait, the SMILES for A is CCn1ncc(...)c1C. So the ring is formed by the n1 at the beginning, then positions 2,3,4,5 are n, c, c, and then the substituent. Then the ring closes back to position 1 (c1C). So that's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens: positions 1 (N), 2 (N), then three carbons. Wait, the exact positions need to be mapped. Alternatively, maybe it's a triazole ring? Let me count. The SMILES starts with CCn1ncc... So the ring is n1 (position 1), then n (position 2), c (3), c (4), and then the substituent at position 4 is C2=..., and then the ring closes back to position 1 with c1C. So that's a five-membered ring: positions 1 (N), 2 (N), 3 (C), 4 (C), 5 (C), but the substituents might vary. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write the ring sequence: CC is attached to N1 (so the N is part of a ring). Then after N1, we have n (another N), c, c, and then a substituent. The substituent is C2=NOC(...). Then the ring closes back to position 1 with c1C. So the ring is five-membered: N1, N, C, C, C (with substituent), and then back to N1. That would make a five-membered ring with two adjacent nitrogens. Then the substituent at position 4 (the third C) is a group with another ring: C2=NOC(...). The C2 here is part of another ring? Let's see: C2=NOC(...)C2. So that's a five-membered ring again? The C2 is connected to N, O, C, etc. So that's another ring closure.\n\nFor Molecule B, the SMILES starts with O1C(...)CC(...)=N1. So the ring here is O1 connected to C, then CC, then a substituent (c2c(...)), and then =N1. That would form a six-membered ring? O1-C-C-C(=N1)-...? Wait, O1 is part of a ring. Let me parse it step by step. The O1 is part of a ring that starts with O1-C(...)-C-C(...)=N1. So the ring would have O1, C, C, C(=N1), and then back to O1. Wait, that's a five-membered ring? Because O1 is connected to C, then two more Cs, then the =N1 which connects back to O1. Let me count: O1-C(...)-C-C(...)=N1. That's O1, C, C, C, N1. So five atoms in the ring: O, C, C, C, N. But the N is double-bonded to the last C. So the ring would have O connected to C, then another C, then another C which is double-bonded to N, which connects back to O1. That's a five-membered ring with O and N. The substituents on the C atoms in this ring would be the other groups.\n\nNow, comparing the two molecules, I need to see if the core structures are the same. Molecule A has a five-membered ring with two nitrogens (maybe a triazole derivative?), and a substituent that includes another ring. Molecule B has a five-membered ring with O and N, and a substituent that includes a ring with two nitrogens. The substituents might be similar but arranged differently.\n\nLooking at the substituents: In Molecule A, the substituent on the first ring is C2=NOC(...). The C2 here is part of a ring that includes N, O, and a benzene ring attached via an amide (N-C(=O)). In Molecule B, the substituent is CC(c2c(n(CC)nc2)C). This part seems to be a cyclopropane? Wait, c2c(...)nc2 would form a five-membered ring again. Let me parse this part: c2c(n(CC)nc2)C. So the ring starts with c2 (position 1), then another c (position 2), then n(CC) (position 3), then n (position 4), c2 (position 5?), forming a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. So this is a ring similar to the one in Molecule A's first part. So substituent in B's ring has a five-membered ring with two nitrogens, similar to A's main ring.\n\nBut the core rings in A and B are different. A's main ring is a five-membered with two nitrogens, while B's main ring is a five-membered with O and N. So unless there's a tautomerism or different representations of the same structure, they might be different. However, SMILES usually represents specific tautomers unless canonicalized. Also, the substituents: in A, the substituent on the main ring includes a group with a N-O-C structure, while in B, the substituent includes a CC group attached to another ring. \n\nAnother angle: check the molecular formula. Let's count the atoms. Molecule A: CCn1ncc(C2=NOC(C(=O)Nc3cccc(C(C)=O)c3)C2)c1C.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- The main chain: CCn1ncc(...)c1C. So:\n\nC, C (ethyl group attached to N1), then the ring: N, N, C, C, substituent, and then back to C. The substituent is C2=NO... which includes another ring. The substituent on the benzene ring in the substituent is C(C)=O (acetyl).\n\nMolecule B: O1C(...)CC(...)=N1. The substituents include a benzene ring with C(=O)C (acetyl) and another ring with two nitrogens.\n\nBut counting all atoms might help. Let's see:\n\nFor Molecule A:\n\nCarbon atoms: Let's count each part.\n\n- CCn1ncc(...)c1C: The ethyl group (CC), then the ring: n1 (N), n (another N), c (C), c (C), substituent (C2=...), then c1C (C attached to ring position 1). So in the main ring: 2 N's, 3 C's (from the ring), plus the ethyl (2 C's) and the C at the end (c1C adds another C). Then substituent: C2=NOC(...). The C2 is part of another ring. The C2=NO... part: C2 (C), N, O, C (from C(=O)...). The C(=O) is part of an amide group: N connected to C=O, which is connected to another benzene ring (c3cccc...). The benzene ring has 6 C's, with a substituent C(C)=O (another acetyl group: 3 C's). So putting this all together, the formula is quite complex. \n\nMolecule B's formula: O1C(...)CC(...)=N1. The main ring includes O, C, C, C, N. The substituents include a benzene ring (6 C's) with C(=O)C (acetyl), and another ring with two N's. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps both molecules have the same atoms but arranged differently. But without drawing them, it's hard to see. Another approach is to convert both SMILES to canonical SMILES using a tool and check if they are identical. Since I can't do that here, I'll have to reason it out.\n\nWait, perhaps the main difference is in the ring systems. Molecule A's main ring is a 1,2,3-triazole (if it's a five-membered ring with two adjacent N's), while Molecule B's main ring is an isoxazoline or similar with O and N. These are different heterocycles, so the molecules would be different. Also, the substituents' positions might vary. \n\nAnother point: The acetyl groups are present in both. In A, the benzene ring substituent is C(C)=O, and in B, it's C(=O)C. Those are the same (acetyl). The amide group (N-C(=O)) is present in both. The rings with two N's are present in both molecules but perhaps as substituents in B and part of the main ring in A. \n\nWait, in Molecule B, the substituent is CC(c2c(n(CC)nc2)C). The c2c(n(CC)nc2) part is a five-membered ring: c2 (C1), then c (C2), n(CC) (N with ethyl), n (N), c2 (C5). So the ring is C1-C2-N(CC)-N-C5-C1, forming a five-membered ring with two adjacent N's, one of which has an ethyl group. This is similar to the main ring in Molecule A, which is also a five-membered ring with two N's (from CCn1ncc...). So in Molecule A, the main ring is the two-N ring, while in B, it's a substituent. The main ring in B is an O-containing ring. \n\nTherefore, the two molecules have different core structures: one has a di-N ring as the main structure, the other has an O-N ring. Hence, they are different molecules. So the answer should be No.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let me try to figure out if these two molecules are the same. So, the user gave me two SMILES strings, Molecule A and Molecule B. I need to compare them and decide if they represent the same molecule.\n\nFirst, I'll start by recalling that SMILES strings can vary in how they're written but still represent the same structure. The order of atoms and the way rings are closed might differ, but the connectivity should be the same. So my job is to parse both SMILES and check if their structural representations are identical.\n\nLooking at Molecule A: CNCc1cc(C(=O)N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2)ccc1Oc1ccccc1C#N\n\nBreaking this down. Let's start from the left. The first part is CNC. That's methyl (CH3), then NH connected to a CH2 (since c is lowercase, it's aromatic? Wait, no, lowercase letters are for aromatic rings. Wait, actually, SMILES uses uppercase for aliphatic atoms and lowercase for aromatic. So \"CNC\" would be CH2-NH-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, \"C\" is aliphatic carbon, \"N\" is nitrogen. So the first part is C-N-C. So that's a chain: maybe like CH2-NH-CH2? Then there's a c1cc(...)ccc1O... So the c1 indicates an aromatic ring (benzene?) with substituents.\n\nWait, let's parse Molecule A step by step.\n\nStarting with CNC: That's probably a chain where the first C is connected to N, which is connected to another C. So maybe it's CH2-NH-CH2 (since each C is connected with single bonds). Then we have c1cc(...)ccc1O... So this is an aromatic benzene ring (the lowercase c's). The substituents on the benzene ring would be at positions indicated by the numbers. Let's see:\n\nThe benzene ring is c1cc(C(=O)N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2)ccc1Oc1ccccc1C#N. Wait, maybe the ring is written as c1cc(...)ccc1, with substituents at positions where the 'C(=O)...' part is. Then there's an O connected to another aromatic ring: Oc1ccccc1C#N. So the O is attached to the first benzene ring, and then there's another benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to that O, with a cyano group (C#N) on it.\n\nNow, looking at the part inside the first benzene ring: C(=O)N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2. The C(=O) is a carbonyl group. Then N2 is a nitrogen that starts a ring closure. Then CCCN(...)CC2. The N here has a substituent of (C3CC3), which is a cyclopropane ring (C3CC3 would form a three-membered ring). So the nitrogen is part of a piperazine-like ring? Let me draw this mentally. The N2 is connected to a chain: C-C-C-N, then the N is connected to a cyclopropane (C3CC3), and then CC2 closes the ring back to N2. So that would form a ring like N-C-C-C-N-C-C, but maybe with the cyclopropane substituent.\n\nNow, Molecule B: N1(C(=O)c2cc(c(Oc3c(cccc3)C#N)cc2)CNC)CCCN(C2CC2)CC1\n\nBreaking this down. Starting with N1(...)CCCN(...)CC1. So this is a nitrogen in a ring. The N1 is part of a ring closure. The substituents on N1 are C(=O)c2cc(...)cc2) and the rest of the ring is C-C-C-N(...)C-C1.\n\nThe C(=O) group is attached to a benzene ring (c2cc(...)cc2). The substituents on the benzene ring are c(Oc3c(cccc3)C#N). So on position 2 (since it's c2cc(...)cc2), there's a substituent: c(Oc3c(cccc3)C#N). Wait, that might be a typo. Let me parse this again.\n\nWait, the SMILES for Molecule B is: N1(C(=O)c2cc(c(Oc3c(cccc3)C#N)cc2)CNC)CCCN(C2CC2)CC1\n\nSo the benzene ring is c2cc(c(...)cc2). The substituent at position c (which is position 3?) is O connected to another aromatic ring: Oc3c(cccc3)C#N. The c3c(cccc3) is another benzene ring (since ccccc would form a six-membered ring?), but the way it's written here might be a different arrangement. The Oc3c(cccc3)C#N would be a benzene ring with an OCH2... Wait, no. Let me parse Oc3c(cccc3)C#N. The 'c3' starts a ring, and the structure is c3c(cccc3), which is a benzene ring. The O is attached to this benzene ring, and the C#N (cyano) is also attached. Wait, the SMILES is Oc3c(cccc3)C#N. So the O is connected to the benzene ring (c3), then the benzene has a cyano group. So it's O-c1c(cccc1)C#N. That would be a benzene ring with an oxygen (like a phenol?) and a cyano group attached. Wait, but in SMILES, the order matters. So the O is attached to the first carbon of the c3 ring, then the next is c(cccc3), which would form a benzene ring. So the O is attached to position 1, and the cyano group is attached where? Let me see: Oc3c(cccc3)C#N. The 'c3' is the first atom of the ring. The next part is c(cccc3), which would be a benzene ring: positions 1 (O attached), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (c), 5 (c), 6 (back to position 1 via the closure). Wait, maybe the ring is written as c3c(cccc3), which would be a benzene ring where the O is attached to position 1, and the C#N is attached to position 2? Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to try to write the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both molecules have the same substituents but arranged differently in the SMILES string. The key is to check if the connectivity is the same.\n\nAnother approach is to convert both SMILES to canonical forms and see if they match. Since I don't have a tool here, I need to mentally check.\n\nLet me compare the substituents. Molecule A has a structure where the benzene ring has a substituent C(=O)N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2, and then an O connected to another benzene ring with a cyano group. Molecule B's SMILES starts with N1(...) which is part of a ring. The substituents on N1 include the C(=O) attached to a benzene ring, which in turn has a substituent that's O connected to another benzene ring with a cyano group. Additionally, there's a CNC group attached to the benzene ring.\n\nWait, in Molecule A, the substituent on the benzene ring is C(=O)N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2. In Molecule B, the substituent on the benzene ring is C(=O) attached to the N1 ring. Let me see if the rings are the same. The N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2 in Molecule A would form a ring: N connected to C-C-C-N(C3CC3)-C-C, forming a 6-membered ring? Let's count: N2 is connected to C, then C, C, N (with substituent C3CC3), then C, C, back to N2. So that's a six-membered ring: positions N2-C-C-C-N-C-C-N2? Wait, no. Wait, N2 is the first atom. Then the sequence is C-C-C-N(C3CC3)-C-C- back to N2. That makes a six-membered ring: N2-C-C-C-N-C-C, but wait, that's six atoms: N, C, C, C, N, C, C? Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me write it out:\n\nThe part is N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2. So starting at N2:\n\nN2 connected to C (first C), then C (second C), then C (third C), then N (which has a substituent C3CC3, a cyclopropane), then C (fourth C), then C (fifth C), and then back to N2. So the ring is N2-C-C-C-N-C-C-N2. Wait, that's six atoms: N2, C, C, C, N, C, C? Wait, that's seven atoms? No, wait: N2 (1), C (2), C (3), C (4), N (5), C (6), C (7), and then back to N2 (1). Wait, that can't be right. That would form a seven-membered ring, but the closure is between C (7) and N2 (1). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is written as N2 followed by CCC, then N, then CC2. So the ring would be N2 connected to C, then C, then C, then N, then C, then C, closing back to N2. That's six members: N2-C-C-C-N-C-C. Wait, that's six members? N2 is position 1, then 2,3,4,5,6. So N-C-C-C-N-C-C would form a seven-membered ring? No, wait: N2 is the first atom. The sequence is N2-C-C-C-N-C-C-CC2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the SMILES notation. Let's try again.\n\nThe substring for the ring in Molecule A is N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2. Breaking it down:\n\n- N2: starts a ring closure at position 2.\n- Then C, C, C, N (with substituent C3CC3), C, C, and then CC2: the last C connects back to N2.\n\nWait, perhaps the ring is N2 connected to C, then C, C, N (with substituent), then C, and then another C which connects back to N2. That would make a 6-membered ring: N2 (1), C (2), C (3), C (4), N (5), C (6), C (7) \u2013 no, that's seven. Hmm, perhaps I'm not parsing this correctly. Alternatively, maybe the ring is N2-C-C-C-N-CC2. Let's count:\n\nN2 (1) connected to C (2), then C (3), C (4), N (5), then C (6), C (7), and then closing back to N2 (1). Wait, that's 7 atoms. That seems too long. Alternatively, maybe the ring is N2-C-C-C-N-C-C2. Wait, the CC2 would be two carbons connected and then closing the ring to N2. So the ring would be N2 (1), C (2), C (3), C (4), N (5), C (6), C (7) connected back to N2 (1). That's a seven-membered ring. But cyclopropane is C3CC3, which is a three-membered ring. But this part is N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2, which seems to have a seven-membered ring. That seems possible.\n\nNow, in Molecule B, the ring is N1(...)CCCN(...)CC1. So starting with N1, then substituents, then C-C-C-N(...), then C-C1. So the ring would be N1 (1), followed by C (2), C (3), C (4), N (5), C (6), C (7) connected back to N1 (1). Again, a seven-membered ring? Hmm, but the substituents inside might differ.\n\nWait, in Molecule B's SMILES: N1(...)CCCN(C2CC2)CC1. The substituent on the N in the ring is (C2CC2), which is a cyclopropane. So the ring is N1-C(=O)... then C-C-C-N(C2CC2)-C-C1. So the ring has seven members: N1, C, C, C, N, C, C, back to N1. Wait, that's seven atoms. So both Molecule A and B have a seven-membered ring with a cyclopropane substituent on the nitrogen?\n\nIf that's the case, perhaps the rings are the same, just written in a different order. Also, the benzene rings attached via the oxygen and the cyano group might be the same.\n\nAnother thing to check is the connectivity of the carbonyl group. In Molecule A, the carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring and then to the N of the seven-membered ring. In Molecule B, the carbonyl is attached to the N1 of the seven-membered ring and then to the benzene ring. Wait, no: in Molecule B, the N1 has a substituent C(=O)c2cc(...)cc2. So the C(=O) is attached to N1, which is part of the seven-membered ring, and then the C(=O) is connected to a benzene ring. In Molecule A, the C(=O) is attached to the benzene ring and then to the N2 of the seven-membered ring. So the direction is different. Wait, that's a key point. If the carbonyl is connecting the benzene to the ring in A, but the ring to the benzene in B, then they might be different.\n\nWait, in SMILES, the order of writing can affect how the groups are connected. For example, in Molecule A: the benzene ring has a substituent C(=O)N2..., meaning the carbonyl is attached to the benzene and then to the N of the ring. In Molecule B: the N1 has a substituent C(=O)c2..., meaning the N is connected to the carbonyl, which is connected to the benzene. So that would imply that in A, the benzene is connected via carbonyl to the ring's N, whereas in B, the ring's N is connected via carbonyl to the benzene. But wait, that's the same thing. Because the direction of the connection is the same. For example, in A: benzene-C(=O)-N-ring. In B: ring-N-C(=O)-benzene. Since the connection is bidirectional (the bond is the same either way), this would represent the same structure. So that part is the same.\n\nThen, looking at the rest of the substituents. In Molecule A, after the O on the benzene, there's another benzene ring (Oc1ccccc1C#N), which is a benzene ring attached via an oxygen, with a cyano group. In Molecule B, the substituent on the benzene is O connected to c3c(cccc3)C#N. The c3c(cccc3) is a benzene ring (since ccccc would form six atoms). So Oc3c(cccc3)C#N would be O attached to a benzene ring which has a cyano group. So that's the same as in Molecule A: a benzene ring attached via oxygen with a cyano group.\n\nNow, the other substituent on the benzene ring in Molecule A is CNC. In Molecule B, the benzene ring (c2cc(c(...)cc2) has a substituent c(Oc3...) which is the oxygen part, and another substituent which is CNC attached? Wait, let me check. In Molecule B's SMILES: c2cc(c(Oc3c(cccc3)C#N)cc2)CNC. So the benzene ring (c2) has substituents at positions: the 'c(Oc3...)' which is position ?, and then 'cc2)CNC'. Wait, the structure is c2cc(c(...)cc2)CNC. The 'c(...)' is a substituent on the benzene ring. Then after that, there's 'cc2)' which closes the ring. Then outside the ring, we have CNC. Wait, no, the SMILES is: c2cc(c(...)cc2)CNC. So after the benzene ring (c2cc(...)cc2), there's a C connected to N connected to C. But how is this connected? The entire benzene ring is part of the substituent on the N1 ring. Wait, perhaps the benzene ring (c2) is connected via the C(=O) to the N1 ring. Then the substituents on the benzene are the O-connected benzene and the CNC group.\n\nWait, let's parse the entire substituent on N1 in Molecule B: C(=O)c2cc(c(Oc3c(cccc3)C#N)cc2)CNC. So the C(=O) is connected to a benzene ring (c2cc(...)cc2), which has a substituent 'c(Oc3...)' and another substituent 'CNC'. Wait, the 'c(Oc3...)' is part of the benzene ring c2. So the benzene ring (c2) has two substituents: one at position 'c(Oc3...)', which is the oxygen connected to another benzene with cyano, and another substituent 'CNC' at another position.\n\nBut in Molecule A, the benzene ring has the substituents C(=O)N2... and O connected to the other benzene. So maybe the substituents are the same but in different positions. However, the positions on the benzene rings are arbitrary in SMILES unless specified with numbers. But SMILES strings don't inherently have numbering that corresponds to actual positions unless explicitly closed. The actual structure depends on the connectivity, not the order in the SMILES string.\n\nBut wait, in SMILES, the order of writing the substituents can affect the perceived positions, but canonical SMILES would order them in a specific way. However, since the user hasn't provided canonical SMILES, I need to determine if the two SMILES strings represent the same structure despite different ordering.\n\nAnother point to check: in Molecule A, the substituents on the first benzene ring are the C(=O) group and the O-connected benzene. In Molecule B, the substituents on the benzene ring (attached to C(=O)) are the O-connected benzene and the CNC group. Are these substituents on the same benzene ring in both molecules?\n\nIn Molecule A: the main benzene ring (c1cc(C(=O)...)ccc1O... So the substituents are at positions where the C(=O) is attached and the O is attached. The 'ccc1O...' suggests that the O is attached at a position three away from the C(=O)? Wait, the benzene ring is written as c1cc(C(=O)...)ccc1O... So the first carbon (1) is connected to the rest of the molecule (the CNC part?), then the next two carbons (positions 2 and 3) are part of the ring. The fourth carbon (position 4) has the C(=O) substituent. Then three more carbons (positions 5,6,1?), and then the O is attached to position 1? Wait, maybe not. The SMILES notation for rings can be tricky. Let me try to visualize.\n\nThe benzene ring in Molecule A is written as c1cc(C(=O)...)ccc1O... So the 'c1' starts the ring. Then 'cc' means the next two carbons (positions 2 and 3). Then the fourth carbon (position 4) has the C(=O) substituent. Then 'ccc1' would be positions 5,6, and back to 1. Then the O is attached to position 1. So the substituents are at position 4 (C(=O)) and position 1 (O). Then the O is connected to another benzene ring.\n\nIn Molecule B, the benzene ring attached to the C(=O) is c2cc(c(Oc3...)cc2)CNC. The 'c2' starts the ring. Then 'cc' (positions 2 and 3), then 'c(Oc3...)' at position 4. Then 'cc2)' closes the ring (positions 5 and 6 back to 2). Then 'CNC' is attached where? After the ring closure, so perhaps the C in 'CNC' is attached to the benzene ring at position 2? Or is it part of the substituent? Wait, the entire SMILES for the substituent on N1 in Molecule B is C(=O)c2cc(c(Oc3...)cc2)CNC. So the C(=O) is connected to the benzene ring c2, which has substituents at positions c(Oc3...) and possibly the 'CNC' group. But how is 'CNC' connected here? The SMILES structure is C(=O)c2cc(c(...)cc2)CNC. The 'CNC' comes after the benzene ring closure. So the benzene ring is connected to the C(=O), and then the 'CNC' is connected to the benzene ring? But in SMILES, after the ring closure (cc2), the 'CNC' would be a substituent on the benzene ring. But where exactly? The SMILES string would imply that the 'CNC' is attached to the benzene ring at the position where the closure happened. But benzene rings are symmetrical, so the exact position might not matter as long as the substituents are adjacent or in the correct positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'CNC' is a chain attached to the benzene ring. In Molecule A, the main chain starts with CNC, which is connected to the benzene ring. In Molecule B, the 'CNC' is attached to the benzene ring that's connected via the carbonyl to the seven-membered ring. So if both molecules have the same substituents (C(=O) connected to a seven-membered ring, O connected to another benzene with cyano, and a CNC group attached to the main benzene), but arranged differently in the SMILES string, they could still be the same molecule.\n\nBut wait, in Molecule A, the main benzene has the substituents C(=O) group and O-linked benzene, and the CNC is part of the main chain (the very beginning of the SMILES: CNCc1...). So the CNC is attached to the benzene ring as a substituent. In Molecule B, the 'CNC' is attached to the benzene ring that's connected to the C(=O) group. So if the benzene rings have the same substituents in the same positions, then they are the same.\n\nBut the order of writing in SMILES can vary. For example, a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3 can be written in different orders, but the canonical SMILES would standardize this. However, since we're not canonicalizing, we need to check if the connectivity matches.\n\nAnother approach: count the number of atoms and bonds. Both molecules should have the same number of each. Let's see:\n\nMolecule A: Let's count the atoms. Starting with CNC (3 atoms: C, N, C). Then the benzene ring (6 carbons), substituents: C(=O) (adds O), N connected to the seven-membered ring (which has N, several Cs, cyclopropane (3 Cs)), then the O-linked benzene (6 Cs, plus C#N (N)). Also, the seven-membered ring in A has several Cs and N.\n\nMolecule B: Starts with N1 (part of a seven-membered ring), which includes C(=O) attached to a benzene (6 Cs), substituents O-linked benzene (6 Cs, C#N), and CNC group. The seven-membered ring in B also has Cs and N with cyclopropane.\n\nIt's possible that the total number of atoms is the same, but without a precise count, it's hard to say. But given that both have similar substituents (C#N, O-linked benzene, C(=O) connected to a seven-membered ring with cyclopropane substituent, and a CNC group), they might be the same.\n\nHowever, the key difference could be in the connectivity. For example, in Molecule A, the CNC is part of the main chain attached to the benzene ring, while in Molecule B, the CNC is a substituent on the benzene ring attached to the C(=O). Wait, but in SMILES, the main chain is determined by the order of writing. But structurally, if the benzene ring has three substituents: C(=O)-..., O-linked benzene, and CNC, then the arrangement would depend on their positions. If the positions are the same, then the molecules are identical. But if the substituents are on different positions, they could be different (like positional isomers).\n\nBut without specific numbering, SMILES strings can represent the same molecule even if the substituents are written in a different order, as long as the connectivity is the same. For example, benzene with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4 can be written in different orders, but if the actual structure has them in those positions, the SMILES may vary but the molecule is the same. However, if the substituents are in different positions (like 1,2,3 vs 1,3,5), then they are different.\n\nIn this case, the challenge is to determine if the substituents on the benzene rings are in the same relative positions. Since the SMILES strings don't use explicit numbering, the order in which the substituents are listed can affect the perceived positions, but the actual connectivity might be the same.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the seven-membered ring in both molecules has a nitrogen atom connected to a cyclopropane. In Molecule A, the seven-membered ring is N2CCCN(C3CC3)CC2, and in Molecule B, it's N1...CCCN(C2CC2)CC1. The substituent is a cyclopropane in both cases, so that part is the same.\n\nPutting it all together, it's possible that both SMILES strings represent the same molecule but written in different orders. The key is whether the connectivity of all groups is the same. Since the substituents are the same (C(=O) linking to a seven-membered ring with cyclopropane, O-linked benzene with cyano, and a CNC group), and assuming the relative positions on the benzene rings are the same (even if written in different orders in the SMILES), then the molecules would be identical.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely \"Yes\", they are the same molecule.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to determine if Molecule A and Molecule B are the same based on their SMILES strings. Alright, first, I'll recall that SMILES notation can sometimes represent the same molecule in different ways due to different starting points or ring numbering. But sometimes, even if the SMILES look different, the actual structure might be the same.\n\nLet me start by looking at both SMILES strings carefully. \n\nMolecule A: COc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N2CCC3(CC2)CC(=O)c2ccccc2O3)cc1OC\nMolecule B: C1(c2ccccc2OC2(C1)CCN(S(=O)(c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC)=O)CC2)=O\n\nHmm, breaking them down. Let's parse each part step by step.\n\nStarting with Molecule A. The SMILES starts with COc1ccc(...)cc1OC. That's a benzene ring (the 'c1ccc...cc1' part) with two methoxy groups (OC) attached. The positions of the methoxy groups are on the benzene ring. The substituents are on positions 1 and 4? Wait, the SMILES notation for benzene rings can be a bit tricky. The 'c1ccc(...)cc1' part: the first 'c' is position 1, then positions 2,3,4, and the last 'cc1' would be positions 5 and 6. Wait, no, SMILES rings are written in order, so each atom is numbered sequentially. So the benzene ring here is six carbons. The first 'c1' is the first carbon. Then three 'c's (positions 2,3,4), followed by the substituent. Then two 'c's (positions 5,6), closing the ring with 'c1'. So the substituent S(=O)(=O)N2CCC3(CC2)CC(=O)c2ccccc2O3 is attached to position 4 of the benzene ring. The benzene has two methoxy groups at positions 1 and 5? Wait, the starting COc1... would be the first carbon (position 1) has a methoxy (COc). Then after three carbons (positions 2,3,4), the substituent is at position 4. Then the ring continues with 'cc1OC', so position 5 and 6. The 'OC' at the end would be attached to position 6. So the benzene ring has methoxy groups at positions 1 and 6, and the sulfonamide substituent at position 4.\n\nNow, the substituent in Molecule A: S(=O)(=O)N2CCC3(CC2)CC(=O)c2ccccc2O3. Let's parse that. The sulfur is connected to two oxygen atoms via double bonds (sulfonyl group: S(=O)(=O)). Then attached to a nitrogen (N2). The nitrogen is part of a cyclohexane ring? Let's see: N2CCC3(CC2)..., so the nitrogen is part of a ring closure with 2. So the nitrogen (atom 2) is connected to three carbons (CCC3). Then there's a ring closure with CC2. Wait, maybe this is a bridged ring system. The N2 is connected to three carbons (CCC3), then the third carbon (atom 3?) is connected to CC2. Hmm, perhaps a bicyclic system. Let's try drawing this mentally. The nitrogen is part of a ring: N2-C-C-C-3, and then the 3 is connected to C-C2, which would form a bridge. Then the 3 is also connected to another ring component (the O3). Wait, maybe it's a bridge between the nitrogen's ring and another ring. Alternatively, perhaps the group is a morpholine ring or something similar. Alternatively, the substituent after the nitrogen is a bridged cyclohexane with an oxygen bridge. Let's see: the part after N2 is CCC3(CC2)CC(=O)c2ccccc2O3. So after the nitrogen (N2), there are three carbons (C-C-C) leading to atom 3. Then (CC2), which would connect back to the nitrogen's ring. So maybe this is forming a bridged structure. For example, the nitrogen is part of a ring where two carbons are connected to form a bridge. Then, the CC(=O) part would be a carbonyl group attached to that bridge. Then there's a c2ccccc2O3, which is a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) connected to an oxygen (O3). Wait, the O3 here would close the ring with atom 3 from earlier. So putting this all together: the substituent is a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N-) attached to a bridged bicyclic system that includes a benzene ring with an oxygen bridge. Maybe it's a benzopyran-like structure?\n\nNow, looking at Molecule B: C1(c2ccccc2OC2(C1)CCN(S(=O)(c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC)=O)CC2)=O.\n\nBreaking this down. The SMILES starts with C1(...)=O. The C1 is part of a ring closure. Let's parse the entire part: C1(c2ccccc2OC2(C1)CCN(...)CC2)=O. So the C1 is connected to a group in parentheses. The group inside is c2ccccc2 (a benzene ring), followed by O, then C2(C1). So the benzene ring is connected via an oxygen to a carbon (C2) which is connected to C1 (from the first closure). Then, C2 is part of another ring closure (C2(...)CC...CC2). The rest is CCN(S(=O)(...)CC2. The nitrogen here is part of a sulfonamide group: S(=O)(...)=O. The part inside the sulfonamide is c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC, which is another benzene ring with two methoxy groups. \n\nWait, let's parse the sulfonamide part: S(=O)(c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC)=O. The sulfur is double-bonded to an oxygen and connected to another oxygen (OC), and a benzene ring. The benzene ring is c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4: the substituents are at positions 3 and 4? Let's see: c1 is the first carbon, then three c's (positions 2,3,4), then substituent (OC), then c(c1) which is position 5 connected to the first carbon (so benzene ring), and OC at position 5. Wait, maybe this benzene has methoxy groups at positions 3 and 5? Alternatively, the SMILES is written as c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC. So starting at position 1, then positions 2,3,4. The substituent at position 3 is OC. Then position 4 is connected to position 5 (c(c1)), which would close the ring, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me write it out:\n\nThe benzene ring is c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC. The first c1 is position 1. Then three c's (positions 2,3,4). At position 4, there's a substituent OC. Then, the next c is position 5, which is followed by (c1) which refers back to position 1 (so position 5 is connected to position 1, making the benzene ring). Then OC is attached to position 5. Wait, that can't be right because the benzene ring has six members. Let me try again. The SMILES is c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC. Breaking down:\n\n- c1: start of the ring, position 1.\n- c: position 2.\n- c: position 3.\n- c: position 4, with substituent (OC) here.\n- c: position 5, which is followed by (c1) meaning it's connected back to position 1. Then OC is attached to position 5. Wait, but the benzene ring would close at position 6. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, the substituents are at positions 4 and 5. Hmm, maybe it's easier to draw. The benzene ring would have methoxy groups at positions 4 and 5. But perhaps the SMILES is written as follows: starting at position 1, then positions 2,3,4 (with OC at 4), position 5, then connected back to position 1 (via c1), making the ring. Then OC is attached to position 5. So the benzene has OC groups at positions 4 and 5. That's a 4,5-dimethoxy benzene ring attached to the sulfonamide.\n\nPutting this all together, Molecule B's structure: The central part is a carbonyl group (C1=O) attached to a bicyclic system. The bicyclic system includes a benzene ring (from the c2ccccc2 part) connected via an oxygen to a carbon (C2) which is part of another ring. The C2 is connected to C1 (from the carbonyl) and forms a ring with CCN and CC2. The nitrogen in this ring is part of a sulfonamide group that connects to the 4,5-dimethoxy benzene ring.\n\nComparing to Molecule A, which has a benzene ring with methoxy groups at positions 1 and 6, a sulfonamide group at position 4 connected to a bicyclic system that includes a carbonyl and another benzene ring with an oxygen bridge.\n\nNow, the key question is whether these two SMILES strings represent the same structure. Let's look for differences. \n\nMolecule A's sulfonamide is attached to a bicyclic system that includes a carbonyl and a benzene ring (from the c2ccccc2O3 part). Molecule B's sulfonamide is attached to a bicyclic system that includes a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) connected via oxygen to a bridge that includes a carbonyl group (C1=O) and a nitrogen in a ring.\n\nWait, perhaps the core structures are similar but arranged differently. Let me try to visualize both structures.\n\nIn Molecule A, the sulfonamide group is connected to a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-like system? The part N2CCC3(CC2)CC(=O)c2ccccc2O3. Let me break it down: the nitrogen (N2) is connected to three carbons (C-C-C) leading to C3. Then, C3 is connected to a CC2 (so a bridge back to the nitrogen's ring). Then, CC(=O) connects to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) which is connected via O3 back to C3. So the bridge includes the oxygen, making a ring of size ... Let's count: N2-C-C-C-O3 connected to the benzene. Hmm, perhaps a benzopyran ring fused with another ring.\n\nIn Molecule B, the central structure is a carbonyl group (C1=O) attached to a bicyclic system. The benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is connected via oxygen to C2, which is part of a bridge that includes the nitrogen. So C2 is part of a ring that includes C1 (from the carbonyl), the benzene ring's oxygen, and the nitrogen in the sulfonamide group. The bicyclic system here might be something like a bridged morpholine or similar.\n\nAnother difference is the substituents on the benzene rings. Molecule A has methoxy groups at positions 1 and 6 of the main benzene ring (the one attached to the sulfonamide). Molecule B's sulfonamide is attached to a benzene ring with methoxy groups at positions 4 and 5 (from the c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC part). Wait, no, actually in Molecule B, the sulfonamide's benzene ring is the one with the methoxy groups. Let me check:\n\nIn Molecule B, the sulfonamide is S(=O)(c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC)=O. The benzene ring here is c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC. So positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. The substituents are at position 4 (OC) and position 5 (OC). So it's a 4,5-dimethoxy benzene ring attached to the sulfonamide. In Molecule A, the main benzene ring (the one with the sulfonamide substituent) has methoxy groups at positions 1 and 6. So the substitution pattern on the benzene rings is different between the two molecules. That would immediately suggest they are different compounds. However, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the positions.\n\nWait, let's re-examine Molecule A's benzene ring. The SMILES is COc1ccc(S...)cc1OC. The 'COc' is the first substituent (position 1). Then after three 'c's (positions 2,3,4), the substituent S... is at position 4. Then 'cc1OC' would be positions 5 and 6, with 'OC' at position 6. So the main benzene ring has methoxy groups at positions 1 and 6. The substituent (sulfonamide) is at position 4. \n\nIn Molecule B, the sulfonamide's benzene ring is in the substituent: S(=O)(c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC)=O. The benzene here is written as c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC. Starting at position 1, then positions 2,3,4. The substituent OC is at position 4. Then position 5 is c(c1), which connects back to position 1. Then OC is at position 5. Wait, that's confusing. Let me parse it step by step:\n\nc1: position 1\nc: position 2\nc: position 3\nc: position 4, with substituent OC\n(c(c1)OC): this part is position 5, which is connected to position 1 (c1), making the benzene ring close. Then OC is attached to position 5. Wait, but benzene has six members. So positions 1-6. The SMILES is c1ccc(OC)c(c1)OC. So:\n\n1: connected to 2 and 6 (via c1...c(c1))\n2: connected to 1 and 3\n3: connected to 2 and 4\n4: connected to 3 and 5, with substituent OC\n5: connected to 4 and 6, with substituent OC\n6: connected to 5 and 1\n\nSo the benzene ring has methoxy groups at positions 4 and 5. \n\nIn Molecule A, the sulfonamide is attached to the main benzene ring at position 4, which has methoxy at 1 and 6. In Molecule B, the sulfonamide is attached to a benzene ring (as part of the substituent) that has methoxy at 4 and 5. \n\nAdditionally, the bicyclic structures in the two molecules seem different. Molecule A's bicyclic system includes a benzene ring (from the c2ccccc2O3 part), whereas Molecule B's bicyclic system includes a different arrangement with a carbonyl group (C1=O) connected to a benzene ring via an oxygen. \n\nAnother point to check is the connectivity of the sulfonamide group. In Molecule A, the sulfonamide is S(=O)(=O)N2..., where the nitrogen is part of a bicyclic system. In Molecule B, the sulfonamide is S(=O)(...)N... where the nitrogen is part of a different bicyclic system. \n\nGiven these differences in substitution patterns on the benzene rings and the different bicyclic structures, it's likely that the two molecules are not the same. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\".",

Let me start by looking at both SMILES and trying to parse them.\n\nMolecule A: Cc1cc(C)cc(NC(=O)Nc2ccc(NS(N)(=O)=O)cc2)c1\nMolecule B: O=C(Nc1ccc(cc1)NS(N)(=O)=O)Nc1cc(C)cc(c1)C\n\nFirst, I'll break down each SMILES to understand their structures. \n\nFor Molecule A, the SMILES starts with a methyl group (C) attached to a benzene ring. The ring is numbered as c1, so the positions are important. The substituents are: a methyl group at position 1 (since the first C is attached to c1), another methyl at position 3 (since after the first C, the next C is at position 3?), then there's a NC(=O)N group attached. The NC(=O)N part is a urea group. The urea's nitrogen connects to another benzene ring (c2), which has a substituent NS(N)(=O)=O. That sulfonamide group (maybe a sulfonamide? Wait, NS(N)(=O)=O would be a sulfonamide where the S is connected to an N and two oxygens. So maybe it's a sulfonamide group attached to the second benzene ring.\n\nMolecule B starts with O=C(N...), which is a carbonyl group (the urea again). The urea's nitrogen is connected to a benzene ring (c1ccc(cc1)NS...). The benzene here has substituents: the NS(N)(=O)=O group (same as in A) and the way the ring is written might have the substituents in different positions. Then the other side of the urea is N connected to another benzene ring (c1cc(C)cc(c1)C), which has two methyl groups. \n\nWait, let me parse the SMILES step by step for both.\n\nMolecule A's structure:\n- Benzene ring (c1) with substituents:\n  - Methyl (C) at position 1 (since the first atom after c1 is C)\n  - Methyl (C) at position 3 (next C after cc)\n  - Then a group NC(=O)N... at position 4 (since after the two Cs, there's cc(NC...))\n  The NC(=O)N part is a urea linkage. The N connects to another benzene ring (c2), which has:\n  - Substituent NS(N)(=O)=O. The NS(N)(=O)=O group: S is connected to N, two O's (as sulfonamide). The position here would be on the c2 ring. The c2 is written as c2ccc(NS...)cc2, so the substituent is at position 4 of the second benzene ring.\n\nMolecule B's structure:\n- Starts with O=C(N...), so the carbonyl is part of a urea group. The left side N is connected to a benzene ring (c1ccc(cc1)NS...). Let's parse c1ccc(cc1): that's a benzene ring where the substituents are at positions 1 and 3? Wait, the SMILES for the first benzene is c1ccc(cc1)NS... So the ring closure is c1, then three carbons (positions 1 to 4?), and then (cc1) might be part of the ring. Wait, maybe the benzene is written as c1ccc(NS...)cc1, but I need to parse it correctly. Alternatively, the substituent NS... is attached to the benzene ring c1. The benzene ring in B's first part is c1ccc(cc1), which could be a bit confusing. Wait, maybe the benzene is written as c1 followed by three c's, then (cc1), which might mean that the ring is closed with a bond. Hmm, perhaps the benzene has a substituent in a certain position. Then, the NS(N)(=O)=O group is attached to that benzene. Then the urea's other side is N connected to another benzene ring (c1cc(C)cc(c1)C). This benzene has two methyl groups: the first C is in position 1, then after two carbons (positions 2 and 3), another C in position 4, and a methyl in position 5? Wait, the SMILES is c1cc(C)cc(c1)C. Let me parse that. The benzene ring starts with c1, then two carbons (positions 1, 2, 3?), then a methyl (C) at position 3, then cc (positions 4 and 5), and another methyl (C) at position 5, then closing the ring with c1. Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. So positions would be 1 (connected to the urea's N), then positions 2 and 3 are carbons, position 4 is a methyl, position 5 and 6 are carbons, and position 6 is another methyl? Or maybe the two methyl groups are in positions 3 and 5? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps both molecules are the same but written with different starting points or different branching orders. SMILES can vary depending on how the rings are closed and the order in which substituents are listed. The key is to see if the connectivity and substituents are identical, regardless of the SMILES string's order.\n\nFor example, the urea group in A is written as NC(=O)N, whereas in B it's O=C(N...), which is the same group but written starting from the carbonyl. The order of the substituents on the benzene rings might differ in the SMILES strings, but if the actual positions are the same, then the molecules are identical. \n\nLooking at the substituents on the benzene rings:\n\nIn Molecule A, the first benzene (c1) has methyl groups at positions 1 and 3, and the urea group at position 4. The second benzene (c2) has the sulfonamide group at position 4.\n\nIn Molecule B, the first benzene (attached to the left side of the urea) has the sulfonamide group. Let's see: the left side of the urea is N connected to c1ccc(cc1)NS... So the benzene ring here has substituents. The SMILES is c1ccc(cc1)NS..., which might mean that the substituents are at positions 3 and 4? Or maybe it's a para-substituted benzene. Wait, parsing c1ccc(cc1)NS...: The ring is c1, then three single bonds (c c c), then a (cc1) which might be part of the ring. Alternatively, maybe the benzene is written as c1 followed by three c's, then (cc1) which closes the ring in a different position. This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene ring is c1, then three c's (positions 1-4?), then a (cc1) which would add two more c's and close the ring. Wait, SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to denote closure. For example, c1ccccc1 is benzene. If it's written as c1ccc(NS...)cc1, then the substituent is in the position where the NS... is placed. So in Molecule B, the left benzene ring (attached to the left N of the urea) is c1ccc(cc1)NS(N)(=O)=O. Let's parse that as follows: c1 is the start of the ring. Then three c's (positions 1, 2, 3), then a (cc1) which would be positions 4 and 5, then NS... as a substituent. Wait, maybe that's not the correct way. Alternatively, the benzene ring is c1, then c c c (positions 1-4?), then (cc1) would mean positions 5 and 6 connected back to position 1. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the SMILES for the benzene in B's left part is c1ccc(cc1), which would form a benzene ring with substituents. Wait, maybe the SMILES is written as c1ccc(NS...)cc1, which would place the substituent at position 4. But in Molecule B, the left benzene is written as c1ccc(cc1)NS..., which might be a typo or a different way of writing. Alternatively, perhaps the NS... group is attached to the benzene ring at a certain position.\n\nThe key is to determine if the two SMILES strings represent the same connectivity. Let me try to canonicalize both SMILES. If they are the same molecule, their canonical SMILES would be identical. However, since I can't compute the canonical SMILES here, I need to compare the structures manually.\n\nIn Molecule A, the urea connects two benzene rings. One benzene (left) has two methyl groups and is connected via the urea to another benzene (right) with a sulfonamide group.\n\nIn Molecule B, the urea also connects two benzene rings. The left benzene (attached to the O=C(N...) part) has the sulfonamide group, and the right benzene (attached to the other N of the urea) has two methyl groups.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. If the urea group is symmetric, then swapping the two aromatic groups would still be the same molecule. But urea is not symmetric because the central carbonyl is connected to two amines. However, if the two aromatic rings are attached to either side of the urea, swapping them would create the same molecule only if the substituents on both rings are identical, which they are not here. In this case, one ring has two methyl groups and the other has a sulfonamide. So if in Molecule A the left ring has methyl groups and the right has sulfonamide, while in Molecule B the left ring has sulfonamide and the right has methyl groups, then they are different molecules. Wait, but urea is a symmetric group. Wait, no, urea is not symmetric. The carbonyl is in the center, connected to two NH groups. However, in the SMILES strings, the urea is written as NC(=O)N, so the two N's are in a specific order. But in reality, the urea group is symmetrical, meaning that the two amine groups are interchangeable. Therefore, if the two benzene rings are attached to either side of the urea, it might still be the same molecule.\n\nWait, but in SMILES, the order matters. For example, NC(=O)Nc1... versus Nc1...C(=O)N... would be different SMILES but could represent the same molecule if the two N's are interchangeable. But urea's structure is such that the two amine groups are on either side of the carbonyl, and swapping them would result in the same molecule. So, if in Molecule A the urea connects ring A (methyl) to ring B (sulfonamide), and in Molecule B the urea connects ring B (sulfonamide) to ring A (methyl), then they are the same molecule because the urea is symmetrical.\n\nSo, the key question is: is the urea group in these SMILES strings allowing the two aromatic rings to be swapped, making the molecules identical?\n\nIf that's the case, then the answer would be yes. But I need to verify the substituents' positions on each benzene ring.\n\nLet's check the benzene rings.\n\nIn Molecule A's left benzene (c1): substituents are at positions 1 (methyl), 3 (methyl), and 4 (urea). Wait, how are the positions determined in SMILES? The order in which the substituents are listed affects the positions. Let me try to reconstruct the benzene ring.\n\nSMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(NC(=O)N...)c1\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- The first C is attached to c1 (position 1).\n- Then comes c1, followed by c (position 2), C (methyl at position 3), c (position 4), then cc (positions 5 and 6?), but then there's NC(=O)N... attached at position 5 perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, the positions are determined by the order of writing. For a benzene ring in SMILES, the substituents are added in the order they appear. So the first substituent is at the first available position, then each subsequent substituent is added in the next position as you go around the ring.\n\nBut this can be ambiguous. For example, the SMILES C1=CC=CN=C1 would form a ring with specific positions. However, in the case of aromatic SMILES (using lowercase c), the numbering is determined by the order of the atoms in the SMILES string.\n\nIn Molecule A's first benzene ring: Cc1cc(C)cc(...)c1\n\nThe ring starts with c1. The first atom after c1 is C (methyl), which is position 1. Then comes c (position 2), C (methyl at position 3), c (position 4), then cc (positions 5 and 6) but then attaching the NC(=O)N... group. Wait, perhaps the NC group is attached at position 5. Then the ring closes back to c1. So the substituents are positions 1 (methyl), 3 (methyl), and 5 (urea group).\n\nIn Molecule B's right benzene ring (attached to the urea's right N): c1cc(C)cc(c1)C\n\nBreaking this down: c1 (start), c (position 2), c (position 3), (C) methyl at position 4, then cc (positions 5 and 6), and another C (methyl) at position 6, closing the ring with c1. Wait, but the SMILES is c1cc(C)cc(c1)C. So positions:\n\n- c1 (position 1)\n- c (position 2)\n- c (position 3)\n- (C) methyl at position 4\n- c (position 5)\n- c (position 6) connected back to c1 (position 1)\n- Then another C (methyl) attached to position 6? Wait, no. The SMILES is c1cc(C)cc(c1)C. Let's parse step by step:\n\nThe benzene ring is c1 followed by atoms:\n\n- c (position 2)\n- c (position 3)\n- (C) methyl at position 4\n- c (position 5)\n- c (position 6) connected to c1 (position 1)\n- Then another C (methyl) attached to which position? The closing c1 is at position 6, and the final C is attached to position 6. Wait, no. The SMILES is c1cc(C)cc(c1)C. So after the ring is closed (c1), there's an additional C. But that would mean the methyl is attached to the ring at position 6. So the substituents are methyl groups at positions 4 and 6.\n\nBut in Molecule A's left benzene, the substituents were at positions 1, 3, and 5. Wait, but in Molecule A's first benzene, the substituents are methyl at position 1 and 3, and urea at position 5. While in Molecule B's right benzene, substituents are methyl at positions 4 and 6. Wait, that can't be right because benzene is a symmetric ring. Positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other. So if in one molecule the methyl groups are at 1 and 3, and in the other at 4 and 6, are they the same? No, because that would be different positions. Wait, but benzene rings can rotate, so the numbering depends on where you start. For example, if a benzene has methyl groups at positions 1 and 3, another way to write that could be 2 and 4 if you start numbering from a different position. However, the actual positions relative to each other (ortho, meta, para) matter.\n\nWait, methyl groups at positions 1 and 3 are meta to each other. In Molecule A's left benzene, substituents are at 1 (methyl), 3 (methyl), and 5 (urea). In Molecule B's right benzene, substituents are at 4 and 6 (methyls), which are meta to each other (positions 4 and 6 are two apart, same as 1 and 3). But the urea group's position would be different. However, if the entire benzene ring is rotated, maybe the positions are equivalent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES strings are written in a way that the benzene rings have the same substituents but numbered differently. For example, in Molecule A's left benzene, the substituents are 1,3,5 (methyl, methyl, urea), which would make them meta to each other. If in Molecule B's right benzene, the substituents are 3,5,1 (methyl, methyl, urea), which is the same arrangement but numbered differently. \n\nBut benzene rings are symmetric, so the actual positions depend on their relative positions. If two methyl groups are meta to each other and the urea is in the para position relative to one of them, then the arrangement is the same. However, I need to check the actual connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two benzene rings with methyl groups are identical. Let me think: in Molecule A's left benzene, the substituents are methyl at 1 and 3, and urea at 5. In Molecule B's right benzene, the substituents are methyl at 4 and 6, and urea at 2. Wait, but the urea is attached to the nitrogen, which is connected to the benzene. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to see if the two SMILES strings are different representations of the same structure due to the symmetry of the urea group and the benzene rings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two molecules are identical because the urea group allows the two aromatic rings to be swapped, and the substituents on each benzene are in positions that are equivalent when considering ring symmetry.\n\nWait, but the sulfonamide group is on different benzene rings in each molecule. In Molecule A, the sulfonamide is on the second benzene (attached to the right side of the urea), while in Molecule B, the sulfonamide is on the first benzene (attached to the left side of the urea). If the urea is symmetrical, then swapping the two benzene rings would result in the same molecule. Therefore, if the sulfonamide and methyl-substituted benzene are swapped around the urea, the molecules would be the same.\n\nBut wait, the urea group is not symmetrical in terms of SMILES notation because the two N's are written in a specific order. However, chemically, the urea group is symmetrical, meaning that the two amine groups are interchangeable. Therefore, swapping the two substituents on either side of the urea would result in the same molecule.\n\nSo, if Molecule A has benzene rings A and B attached to the urea, and Molecule B has benzene rings B and A attached to the urea, they are the same molecule. \n\nAdditionally, the substituents on each benzene must be the same. In this case, the first benzene in A has two methyl groups and a urea substituent, while the second benzene in B has the same. Wait, no\u2014Molecule A's left benzene has two methyl groups and the urea, and the right benzene has the sulfonamide. Molecule B's left benzene has the sulfonamide and the right benzene has two methyl groups. If the urea is symmetrical, then swapping the two sides would give the same molecule. Therefore, the two molecules would be identical.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"Yes\".",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants to know if these two SMILES strings represent the same molecule. The molecules are A: Nc1cccc(-n2nncc2-c2ccccc2)c1 and B: c1ccccc1-c1cnnn1-c1cc(N)ccc1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how SMILES notation works. SMILES strings describe the structure of molecules using letters for atoms and numbers for ring closures. The order of the atoms in the string can sometimes vary, but the connectivity should be the same if they're the same molecule. Also, branches are indicated with parentheses, and hyphens might be used for clarity but don't affect the structure.\n\nLet me start by breaking down each SMILES string.\n\nFor Molecule A: Nc1cccc(-n2nncc2-c2ccccc2)c1\n\nBreaking it down step by step:\n- The first part is Nc1cccc(...)c1. So, an amino group (NH2) attached to a benzene ring (c1cccc...c1). The benzene ring has five carbon atoms and one nitrogen in the amino group. Wait, no, the c's are carbons unless specified. So the amino group is attached to the benzene ring at position 1 (since it's Nc1...). Then, there's a branch at position 4 of the benzene ring (since it's c1cccc(...)c1; the positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, let me visualize the benzene ring. The first atom is position 1, then the next four c's would be positions 2,3,4,5, and then the closing c1 is position 6. The branch is at position 4 (the fourth carbon in the sequence). So the benzene ring (c1) has substituents: NH2 at position 1, and the branch at position 4.\n\nThe branch is -n2nncc2-c2ccccc2. Let's parse that. The hyphen indicates a branch. The group is n2nncc2, which is a ring. The n2 is the first atom (a nitrogen), followed by two more nitrogens (nn), then two carbons (cc), and closing the ring with the second nitrogen (n2). Wait, maybe the ring closure is at the end. Let me re-examine: n2nncc2. The ring starts at n2 and ends at cc2? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, SMILES notation uses numbers to denote ring closures. So, n2nncc2 would mean that the nitrogen (n2) is connected via a ring closure to the last atom (the second c?), but that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a five-membered ring. Let me try drawing it. Starting with nitrogen (n2), then another nitrogen (n), then another nitrogen (n), then two carbons (c, c), and then back to the first nitrogen (n2) via the ring closure (2). Wait, that would make a ring of five atoms: n, n, n, c, c. Wait, that's five atoms? No, n2 is the first atom, then n, n, c, c, and closing to n2. That's a five-membered ring: N-N-N-C-C connected back to the first N. That seems a bit unusual. Then, after that, there's a hyphen and another group: -c2ccccc2. That's another benzene ring (c2ccccc2), connected via a single bond to the previous part.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the entire branch again. The branch is (-n2nncc2-c2ccccc2). So, the benzene ring (Molecule A) has at position 4 a substituent which is a group connected as follows: a nitrogen (n2) connected to the benzene ring, then forming a ring with the next atoms. Let me try again. The substituent at position 4 is -n2nncc2, which is a ring. Then, connected to that is -c2ccccc2 (another benzene ring). So, the substituent is a nitrogen-containing ring connected to another benzene ring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the structure is a triazole ring. Triazoles have three nitrogens. Let's see: the n2nncc2 part. If it's a triazole, that would be a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Let's count the atoms: n2 (first atom), n, n, c, c, and then back to n2. That's five atoms: positions 1 (n2), 2 (n), 3 (n), 4 (c), 5 (c), and then connected back to position 1 (n2). So, the ring would be N-N-N-C-C, which is a five-membered ring with three nitrogens and two carbons. That's possible. But triazoles are typically 1,2,3-triazole (with three adjacent nitrogens) or 1,2,4-triazole. But this seems like three nitrogens in a row. That might be a 1,2,3-triazole ring. However, the exact structure would depend on the bonding. Wait, SMILES notation assumes valence. So, each atom must have appropriate valence. For nitrogen in a ring, if it's part of a double bond, its valence would be satisfied. Let me think: the n2nncc2 part. Let's number them as positions 1 to 5. Position 1 is n2 (ring closure), position 2 is n, position 3 is n, position 4 is c, position 5 is c, then back to position 1. If that's the case, then each nitrogen would have to have appropriate bonds. For example, if the nitrogens are in a ring with alternating single and double bonds. Let's say positions 1 (N) is double-bonded to position 2 (N), then single to position 3 (N), double to position 4 (C), single to position 5 (C), and back to position 1. But that might not satisfy valences. Alternatively, maybe there's a different bonding pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the SMILES string. Wait, the substituent is -n2nncc2. Let me write that as N connected to the benzene ring, then another N, another N, then two Cs, and closing the ring with the second N (n2). Wait, maybe the ring is between the first N (n2) and the last C (c2)? No, the closure is indicated by the number 2. So the n2 is connected to the c2 at the end. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the SMILES string is written as n2nncc2, which would be: start at atom 2 (n2), then n, n, c, c, and then close the ring by connecting back to atom 2. That would form a five-membered ring: positions 2 (N), 3 (N), 4 (N), 5 (C), 6 (C), and back to 2. Wait, but that's a five-membered ring. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should draw this out step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a SMILES parser would help, but since I can't do that here, I need to analyze manually.\n\nNow, moving to Molecule B: c1ccccc1-c1cnnn1-c1cc(N)ccc1\n\nBreaking it down:\n- The first part is c1ccccc1, which is a benzene ring (positions 1-6). Then connected via a single bond (-) to another part: c1cnnn1. Let's parse that. The c1 is the first carbon in a ring. Then c (another carbon), then n, n, n, and closing the ring with 1 (c1). Wait, that would form a five-membered ring: c1, c, n, n, n, and back to c1. So, that's a ring with two carbons and three nitrogens. Then, after that, another single bond to -c1cc(N)ccc1. That's another benzene ring (c1cc...ccc1) with an amino group (N) at position 3 (since it's c1cc(N)ccc1: positions 1,2,3 (N),4,5,6).\n\nPutting it all together: Benzene ring connected to a five-membered ring (two carbons, three nitrogens), which is connected to another benzene ring with an amino group.\n\nComparing this to Molecule A: which has a benzene ring with an amino group at position 1 and a substituent at position 4, which is a triazole-like ring connected to another benzene.\n\nWait, but in Molecule A, the substituent is -n2nncc2-c2ccccc2. Let me re-express that. The substituent is a group attached to the main benzene at position 4. The group is a ring (n2nncc2) connected to another benzene (c2ccccc2). The n2nncc2 part: starting with a nitrogen (n2), then two more nitrogens (n, n), followed by two carbons (c, c), and closing the ring with the second nitrogen (n2). So, the ring would have five atoms: N, N, N, C, C. That's a 1,2,3-triazole ring but with an extra carbon? Wait, no, triazoles are five-membered rings with three nitrogens. For example, 1,2,3-triazole would have three nitrogens in a row. But in this case, the ring has three nitrogens followed by two carbons. So the sequence is N-N-N-C-C connected back to the first N. That makes a five-membered ring with three nitrogens and two carbons. Then, this ring is connected via a single bond to another benzene ring (c2ccccc2).\n\nIn Molecule B, the structure is benzene connected to a ring (c1cnnn1) which is a five-membered ring: c, c, n, n, n. So, the ring is C-C-N-N-N connected back to the first C. Then, this ring is connected to another benzene ring with an amino group.\n\nWait, but the substituent positions might differ. Let's compare the connectivity.\n\nIn Molecule A, the main benzene has NH2 at position 1, and at position 4, there's a substituent which is a five-membered ring (N-N-N-C-C) connected to another benzene. In Molecule B, the main structure is benzene connected to a five-membered ring (C-C-N-N-N) which is connected to another benzene with NH2 at position 3 (since in the SMILES string, it's c1cc(N)ccc1, which would be positions 1, 2, 3 (NH2), 4,5,6).\n\nSo, the two molecules might have similar components but arranged differently. The key differences would be:\n\n1. The position of the amino group: in A, it's on the main benzene ring; in B, it's on the third benzene ring (the one attached via the five-membered ring).\n\n2. The structure of the five-membered ring: in A, it's N-N-N-C-C; in B, it's C-C-N-N-N. So the order of atoms in the ring is different. In A, three nitrogens followed by two carbons; in B, two carbons followed by three nitrogens. However, since rings can be numbered in different directions, maybe they're the same if the sequence is circular. For example, N-N-N-C-C in a ring could be the same as C-C-N-N-N if you start numbering from a different atom. Let me think about that. If you have a five-membered ring with atoms in the order N1-N2-N3-C4-C5, and you start numbering from C4, it would be C4-C5-N1-N2-N3. So depending on the direction of numbering, the SMILES strings could represent the same ring. However, the connectivity must be the same. But in A's ring, the substituent is connected to the main benzene via the first N (n2), whereas in B's ring, the substituent is connected via the first C (c1). So in A, the five-membered ring is connected via a nitrogen, and in B, via a carbon. That would make the structures different. Because in one case the ring is connected via a nitrogen atom, and in the other via a carbon atom. The substituent's point of attachment is different, leading to different structures.\n\nAdditionally, the connectivity between the rings. In A, the main benzene (with NH2) is connected to the five-membered ring (N-N-N-C-C) which is connected to another benzene. In B, the main benzene is connected to the five-membered ring (C-C-N-N-N) which is connected to the benzene with NH2. So the overall connectivity is different. The amino group is on different benzene rings in each case.\n\nTherefore, even though both molecules have two benzene rings and a five-membered ring with three nitrogens, the positions of the amino group and the connectivity of the rings are different, making them distinct molecules.\n\nSo the answer should be No.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let me try to figure out if these two molecules are the same. So, the user gave me two SMILES strings, Molecule A and Molecule B. My job is to determine if they represent the same structure.\n\nFirst, I need to parse both SMILES and visualize their structures. SMILES can sometimes be written in different orders but still represent the same molecule. Let's take them one by one.\n\nMolecule A: CN1C(=O)C(Cc2ccc(-c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-])cc2)NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21. Breaking this down. The first part is CN1C(=O), which suggests a nitrogen in a ring (since the 1 is a ring closure), with a methyl group (C) attached and a carbonyl (C=O). Then there's a chain: C(Cc2ccc(...)cc2) which is a carbon attached to another carbon chain. The part inside the parentheses after c2ccc is -c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-]. That looks like a nitro group attached to a benzene ring. So, substituents here: a nitrobenzene group connected via a single bond. Then NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21. The NC(=O) is a carbamate group? The c2cc(Cl)ccc21 suggests another benzene ring with a chlorine substituent and connected back to the first ring (because of the 1 closure). So putting it all together, maybe a bicyclic structure with a nitro group on one benzene ring, a chlorine on another, and some carbonyl groups and a methyl group attached to the nitrogen in the ring.\n\nMolecule B: c1(c(cccc1)-c1ccc(CC2NC(c3cc(Cl)ccc3N(C2=O)C)=O)cc1)[N+]([O-])=O. Let's parse this. Starting with c1(...)[N+]([O-])=O. The nitro group is at the end here. The main ring is c1(c(...)cccc1). The substituent is -c1ccc(...)cc1. Inside that substituent: CC2NC(...)=O. The CC2 suggests a carbon chain leading to a ring closure 2. Then NC(...) where the ... is c3cc(Cl)ccc3N(C2=O)C. This part: c3cc(Cl)ccc3 is a benzene ring with chlorine, connected to N(C2=O)C. So, here, the nitrogen is attached to the C2=O (which is part of the ring closure 2), and a methyl group (C).\n\nComparing both structures. Let's see if the core structures match. Both have a nitro group attached to a benzene ring. Both have a chlorine on another benzene ring. Both have a bicyclic system with carbonyl groups. The methyl group in Molecule A is attached to N1, while in Molecule B, there's a methyl (C) attached to the nitrogen in the NC(c3...) part. The positions of substituents might differ. For example, in Molecule A, the nitro group is on a benzene ring connected via a single bond, while in Molecule B, the nitro is on the main benzene ring. Wait, let me check again.\n\nIn Molecule A, the nitro group is part of -c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-], which is connected via a single bond to the c2ccc ring. So the nitro is on a benzene that's attached as a substituent to another benzene. In Molecule B, the nitro is on the main benzene ring (the first c1(...)[N+]...). Then, the substituent is a benzene ring connected to a CC2NC(...) group. The chlorine is on a benzene ring in both cases, but in Molecule B, the chlorine's position might be different. Let me count the positions.\n\nIn Molecule A: the chlorine is on c2cc(Cl)ccc21. The benzene ring here has the chlorine in position 2 (since it's the second atom after c2). Wait, SMILES notation is about the order of atoms. So, for c2cc(Cl)ccc21, the ring closure is between the first c and the last 1. The sequence is: start at position 1 (the c2), then another c (position 2?), then Cl in position 3, then three c's, then closure to position 1 (the c2). So the chlorine is at position 3 of that benzene ring. Wait, maybe I need to draw this. Alternatively, think that in SMILES, the order matters. For example, c1ccccc1 is benzene. If it's c1ccc(Cl)cc1, the Cl is in position 4. But in Molecule A: c2cc(Cl)ccc21. So starting from the first atom (atom 1), then atom 2 (c), atom 3 (Cl), then three c's (atoms 4,5,6), then closure to atom 2 (since it's c2...21). Wait, maybe that's not right. The closure numbers indicate which atoms are connected. Let's parse the ring closures properly.\n\nMolecule A's part: c2cc(Cl)ccc21. The ring closure is 1 and 2. So the benzene ring starts at c2, then next atoms are c, Cl, c, c, c, then closure to the first atom (c2) via closure 1. So positions are: c2 (atom1), c (atom2), Cl (atom3), c (atom4), c (atom5), c (atom6), and closure between atom6 and atom1 (c2). So the Cl is at position 3 (ortho to the point of attachment? Wait, the point of attachment is where the ring is connected to the rest of the molecule. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Similarly, in Molecule B's c3cc(Cl)ccc3 part: c3 is the start, then c, Cl, c, c, c, closure to c3. So Cl is at position 2. Wait, but SMILES is a linear notation, so the positions depend on the order. For example, c3cc(Cl)ccc3 would be benzene with Cl at position 2. Because the SMILES is c3 (atom1), c (atom2), c(Cl) (atom3), then c (atom4), c (atom5), c (atom6), closure to atom1 (c3). So the Cl is on atom3, which is the third atom in the ring. In benzene, each atom is adjacent, so positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If the Cl is on atom3, that's position 3. But in SMILES, the numbering depends on the order written, so it's relative. So in the ring, the first atom is position 1, next is 2, etc. So in c3cc(Cl)ccc3, the Cl is on position 3. In Molecule A, the part c2cc(Cl)ccc21: the ring starts with c2 (atom1), then atom2 is c, atom3 is Cl, then atoms 4,5,6. Closure to atom1 (c2) via closure 1. So Cl is at position3. Then, the ring is connected via closure 2 (the 21 at the end) to another part. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Let's not get stuck here. Maybe the key is to see if the overall structure is the same, considering possible different ways of writing SMILES.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two SMILES are just different representations of the same molecule. Let me consider that SMILES can have different orders but same structure. For example, different starting points or different ring numbering. To check if they are the same, perhaps canonical SMILES would help. But since I can't compute that here, I need to analyze the connectivity.\n\nLooking at both molecules, they both have:\n\n- A nitro group (O=[N+]([O-]) attached to a benzene ring.\n\n- A chlorine attached to another benzene ring.\n\n- A bicyclic system with two carbonyl groups (C=O) and a methyl group attached to a nitrogen.\n\nIn Molecule A, the nitro group is on a benzene ring that is attached as a substituent to another benzene (from the part -c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-]). The chlorine is on a benzene ring that's part of a bicyclic system with the nitrogen and carbonyl groups.\n\nIn Molecule B, the nitro group is on the main benzene ring. Then, there's a substituent which is a benzene ring connected via a chain (CC2NC...) to another bicyclic system. The chlorine is on a benzene ring in that substituent's structure.\n\nWait, maybe the connectivity is different. Let me try to sketch a rough structure.\n\nMolecule A: A central bicyclic system (maybe a benzodiazepine-like structure?) with a methyl group on the nitrogen, two carbonyl groups. One benzene ring has a nitro group attached via a single bond (as a substituent), and another benzene ring (part of the bicyclic system) has a chlorine.\n\nMolecule B: A benzene ring with a nitro group. Attached to this benzene is another benzene ring via a single bond. That attached benzene has a substituent which is a chain leading to a bicyclic system with a chlorine and carbonyl groups, and a methyl group on the nitrogen.\n\nWait, maybe the two molecules are structural isomers but differ in where the substituents are attached. If the nitro group is on different rings or positions, then they're different. Alternatively, if the connectivity is the same but written differently in SMILES, they could be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are enantiomers or stereoisomers, but SMILES doesn't specify stereochemistry here, so if that's the case, but since there's no indication of stereochemistry in the SMILES, they might be considered the same. But the problem here is connectivity.\n\nAnother approach: check if the molecular formulas are the same. Let's count the atoms.\n\nMolecule A: Let's parse the formula.\n\nCN1C(=O)C(Cc2ccc(-c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-])cc2)NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- C (1)\n\n- N1 (so N here, part of a ring)\n\n- C(=O) (C, O)\n\n- C (another C)\n\n- (Cc2ccc(...)cc2): C connected to C, then c2 (ring), ccc(...) cc2. The ... is -c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-]: another benzene ring (6 carbons) with nitro group (N, O2, plus charge). So the substituent here adds C (from Cc2...), then the benzene (6 C), and the nitro group (N, O2).\n\nThen NC(=O): N, C, O.\n\nc2cc(Cl)ccc21: benzene ring (6 C) with Cl.\n\nSo counting all:\n\nCarbons:\n\nMain structure: Let's count step by step.\n\nStarting from CN1C(=O)C(...):\n\n- C (from CN1): 1\n\n- N: not counting.\n\n- C(=O): 1 C, 1 O.\n\n- C: 1 C.\n\nThen the substituent Cc2ccc(...)cc2:\n\n- C (from Cc2): 1 C.\n\n- The c2 ring: 6 C (since c2ccc...cc2: 6 carbons in the benzene ring).\n\n- The substituent -c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-]: another benzene (6 C), plus the nitro group (N, O2).\n\nThen NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21:\n\n- N, C(=O) (1 C, 1 O).\n\n- The c2 ring: 6 C, plus Cl.\n\nSo total carbons:\n\nMain chain: CN1C(=O)C: 1 (C) + 1 (C in C(=O)) + 1 (C) = 3 C.\n\nSubstituent: Cc2...: 1 C (from Cc2) + 6 C (benzene c2) + 6 C (benzene c3) = 13 C.\n\nThen the NC(=O)c2...: 1 C (C(=O)) + 6 C (benzene c2) = 7 C.\n\nWait, but this might be double-counting. Because the c2 in NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21 is part of the bicyclic system. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total carbons would be:\n\nFor Molecule A:\n\n- The main bicyclic system: The rings connected via the N. Let's see: the first part is CN1C(=O)C(...)NC(=O)c2... The rings are connected as 1 and 2. So the main structure has two rings fused together. Each ring is 6-membered? Let's see: the c2 in the NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21 part. That would be a benzene ring (6 C) with Cl. Then, the other ring is connected via the N1. So perhaps the main bicyclic system has 6+6=12 C? But with substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, this is getting too complicated. Let me count the atoms systematically.\n\nMolecule A SMILES: CN1C(=O)C(Cc2ccc(-c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-])cc2)NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21.\n\nBreaking down each part:\n\n- C: 1\n\n- N1: 1 N\n\n- C(=O): 1 C, 1 O\n\n- C: 1 C\n\n- (Cc2ccc(...)cc2): the C here is 1 C, then the benzene ring (c2ccc...cc2) has 6 C. The substituent -c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-] is another benzene (6 C) and nitro (N, O2).\n\n- NC(=O): 1 N, 1 C, 1 O\n\n- c2cc(Cl)ccc21: benzene (6 C) with Cl.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCarbons:\n\n1 (first C) + 1 (C in C(=O)) + 1 (next C) + 1 (in Cc2) + 6 (benzene c2) + 6 (benzene c3) + 1 (C in NC(=O)) + 6 (benzene c2 in the last part) + 1 (Cl is not a carbon).\n\nWait, but the Cl is a substituent, not a carbon. So total carbons:\n\n1 +1 +1 +1 +6 +6 +1 +6 = 23?\n\nPlus the C in the nitro group? No, nitro is [N+](=O)[O-], so no extra carbons.\n\nWait, but wait: the main chain might have overlapping rings. For example, the bicyclic system may share carbons. Let me recount.\n\nThe main structure:\n\nCN1C(=O)C(...)NC(=O)c2... So the N1 is part of a ring. The part after NC(=O) is another ring (c2...). So perhaps the main bicyclic system has two fused rings, each of which is 6-membered. But the actual count might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire SMILES and count each carbon once, considering the rings.\n\nBut this is getting time-consuming. Let's try Molecule B.\n\nMolecule B: c1(c(cccc1)-c1ccc(CC2NC(c3cc(Cl)ccc3N(C2=O)C)=O)cc1)[N+]([O-])=O.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- c1(...)[N+]([O-])=O: benzene (6 C) with nitro group (N, O2).\n\nThe main benzene has a substituent: -c1ccc(...)cc1. The substituent is another benzene (6 C) connected via a single bond. Inside that substituent: CC2NC(...)=O. So C-C (two carbons) connected to N (part of a ring closure 2). The NC(...) part: N connected to C(...). The ... is c3cc(Cl)ccc3N(C2=O)C. So a benzene (6 C) with Cl, and N connected to C2=O (ring closure) and a methyl group (C).\n\nSo counting carbons for Molecule B:\n\nMain benzene: 6 C.\n\nSubstituent benzene: 6 C.\n\nChain: CC2... (2 C).\n\nThe c3 benzene: 6 C.\n\nN(C2=O)C: 1 C (methyl).\n\nPlus the nitro group (no extra C).\n\nTotal carbons: 6 + 6 + 2 +6 +1 = 21? Plus any others? Maybe I'm missing some. Let me check again.\n\nMain benzene (6), substituent benzene (6), CC2 (2 C), then the c3 benzene (6 C), and the methyl C. That's 6+6+2+6+1=21. Then the main chain might have more carbons. For example, the NC(...)=O part. The N is part of a ring (closure 2), so perhaps there are more carbons in the ring.\n\nWait, the part after CC2 is NC(c3...)C(=O). So the NC is connected to the C2 ring. The C2 ring would be part of a bicyclic system? For example, if C2 is part of a ring, then the ring could have multiple carbons. Let me parse that.\n\nThe substituent is -c1ccc(CC2NC(...)=O)cc1. So the CC2 part is two carbons connected to ring closure 2. Then NC(...)=O. The N is connected to a C (from NC(...)), which is part of a ring closure 2. So the ring closure 2 would be between C2 and the N? Or other atoms? This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ring closure 2 in Molecule B is part of a lactam structure. The NC(...)=O suggests a carbonyl group attached to N, which is part of a ring. So the ring closure 2 would form a ring with the N and the carbonyl. For example, a five-membered or six-membered ring.\n\nBut regardless of the exact structure, the key is to compare the molecular formulas of A and B.\n\nIf the molecular formulas are different, then the molecules are different. Let's compute that.\n\nMolecule A:\n\nCarbons: Let's count each 'C' in the SMILES, considering ring closures.\n\nMolecule A SMILES:\n\nC (1) N1 C(=O) C (2) (C (3) c2 c c c (-c3 c c c c c3 [N+](=O)[O-]) c c2) N (4) C(=O) c2 c c (Cl) c c c21.\n\nBreaking down each carbon:\n\n- The first 'C' (1).\n\n- The 'C' in C(=O) (2).\n\n- The next 'C' (3).\n\n- The 'C' in Cc2 (4).\n\n- The benzene ring c2: 6 C (5-10).\n\n- The substituent -c3 c c c c c3: benzene, 6 C (11-16).\n\n- The 'C' in NC(=O) (17).\n\n- The benzene ring c2 (again, but this is part of the bicyclic system, so maybe overlapping with previous? Wait, the closure is 21, so the c2 here is the same as the earlier c2? No, because SMILES uses numbers for ring closures. In Molecule A, the main structure has closure 1 and 2. Let's clarify:\n\nThe SMILES is CN1C(=O)C(...)NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21.\n\nThe 'c2' here is a new ring closure, so the '2' refers to the same number as earlier? Or is it a different closure? In SMILES, the numbers are local. Each number refers to a specific ring closure. So in this case, the 'c2' in the second part is connected via closure '2' to the first part. So the bicyclic system is formed by closures 1 and 2.\n\nBut regardless, the total number of unique carbons would be:\n\nInitial C: 1.\n\nC(=O): 1.\n\nNext C: 1.\n\nC in Cc2: 1.\n\nBenzene c2: 6.\n\nSubstituent benzene c3:6.\n\nNC(=O): C here is 1.\n\nBenzene c2 in the last part (but connected via closure 2 and 1): 6 (but some may overlap with the earlier c2? No, because the closure numbers are different. Wait, no: the closures 1 and 2 are in different parts. The first closure is N1, and the last part has c2...21. So closure 1 is between the N and the last benzene's closure 1. This is getting too confusing. Maybe better to count each 'C' and 'c' in the SMILES, case-insensitive (since lowercase 'c' is aromatic carbon).\n\nSo:\n\nMolecule A:\n\nC, N1, C(=O), C, (C, c, c, c, (-c, c, c, c, c, c), c, c), N, C(=O), c, c, (Cl), c, c, c, 2, 1.\n\nCount all 'C' and 'c' as carbons:\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. C (first character)\n2. C in C(=O)\n3. C (after N1C(=O))\n4. C (start of substituent: C(Cc2...)\n5. C in Cc2\n6. c2 (aromatic carbon)\n7. c (next)\n8. c (next)\n9. c (next)\n10. -c3 (aromatic carbon)\n11. c (next in c3ccccc3)\n12. c\n13. c\n14. c\n15. c\n16. c3 (closure)\n17. c (after substituent)\n18. c\n19. N (not a carbon)\n20. C(=O) (another carbon)\n21. c2 (aromatic in the last part)\n22. c\n23. c (Cl attached)\n24. c\n25. c\n26. c\n27. 2 (closure)\n28. 1 (closure)\n\nWait, this is not efficient. Let's just count every 'C' and 'c' in the SMILES string, excluding the parts in the nitro group and chloride.\n\nMolecule A's SMILES:\n\nC N1 C(=O) C (C c2 c c c (-c3 c c c c c3 [N+](=O)[O-]) c c2) N C(=O) c2 c c (Cl) c c c21.\n\nCount of 'C' and 'c':\n\n- Uppercase C: Let's see:\n\n- The first C: 1.\n\n- C in C(=O): 2.\n\n- Next C:3.\n\n- C in (C c2...):4.\n\n- C in Cc2:5.\n\n- Then lowercase c's: c2, c, c, c, (-c3, c, c, c, c, c3), c, c2: let's count each lowercase c as one.\n\nc2:1\n\nc:2\n\nc:3\n\nc:4\n\n-c3:5\n\nc:6\n\nc:7\n\nc:8\n\nc:9\n\nc:10\n\nc3:11 (closure)\n\nc:12\n\nc:13\n\nc2:14 (closure)\n\nThen after N C(=O):\n\nC in C(=O):6.\n\nc2:15 (new aromatic)\n\nc:16\n\nc:17 (Cl)\n\nc:18\n\nc:19\n\nc:20\n\nc21:21 (closure)\n\nSo total carbons: uppercase C's: 6 (positions 1-5 and the C in NC(=O)), lowercase c's: 21.\n\nWait, this is wrong because each 'c' in the SMILES is an aromatic carbon, so each counts as one. So total carbons: uppercase C's (6) + lowercase c's (each 'c' in the string, except for parts like [N+] etc.)\n\nBut in SMILES, lowercase 'c' is an aromatic carbon. So every 'c' in the string is a carbon. So let's count all 'C' and 'c' letters, excluding those in the nitro group and chloride.\n\nMolecule A:\n\nOriginal SMILES string:\n\nCN1C(=O)C(Cc2ccc(-c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-])cc2)NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21\n\nBreaking it into characters:\n\nC, N, 1, C, (, =, O, ), C, (, C, c, 2, c, c, c, (, -, c, 3, c, c, c, c, c, 3, [N+, ], (, =, O, ), [O-, ], ), c, c, 2, ), N, C, (, =, O, ), c, 2, c, c, (, Cl, ), c, c, c, 2, 1.\n\nNow, count all 'C' and 'c' that are part of the carbon\u9aa8\u67b6:\n\n- C (first character): 1\n\n- C in C(=O):2\n\n- C after N1C(=O):3\n\n- C in (C...):4\n\n- C in Cc2:5\n\n- c2:6\n\n- c:7\n\n- c:8\n\n- c:9\n\n- -c3:10\n\n- c3:11\n\n- c:12\n\n- c:13\n\n- c:14\n\n- c:15\n\n- c3:16 (closure)\n\n- c:17\n\n- c:18\n\n- c2:19 (closure)\n\n- N: not carbon.\n\n- C in NC(=O):20\n\n- C(=O):21\n\n- c2:22\n\n- c:23\n\n- c:24\n\n- (Cl): not carbon.\n\n- c:25\n\n- c:26\n\n- c:27\n\n- c2:28\n\n- 1: closure.\n\nTotal carbons: 28? That seems high, but maybe correct.\n\nNow Molecule B:\n\nc1(c(cccc1)-c1ccc(CC2NC(c3cc(Cl)ccc3N(C2=O)C)=O)cc1)[N+]([O-])=O.\n\nBreaking into characters:\n\nc, 1, (, c, (, c, c, c, c, 1, ), -, c, 1, c, c, c, (, C, C, 2, N, C, (, c, 3, c, c, (, Cl, ), c, c, c, 3, N, (, C, 2, =, O, ), C, ), =, O, ), c, c, 1, ), [N+, ], (, [O-, ], ), =, O.\n\nCount 'C' and 'c':\n\n- c1:1\n\n- c:2\n\n- c:3\n\n- c:4\n\n- c:5\n\n- c:6\n\n- c:7\n\n- c1:8\n\n- -c1:9\n\n- c1:10\n\n- c:11\n\n- c:12\n\n- c:13\n\n- C:14\n\n- C:15\n\n- 2: closure.\n\n- N: not carbon.\n\n- C:16\n\n- (c3:17\n\n- c3:18\n\n- c:19\n\n- c:20\n\n- (Cl): not.\n\n- c:21\n\n- c:22\n\n- c:23\n\n- c3:24 (closure)\n\n- N: not.\n\n- C:25\n\n- 2: closure.\n\n- =O: not.\n\n- C:26\n\n- =O: not.\n\n- c:27\n\n- c:28\n\n- c1:29 (closure)\n\n- [N+], etc.: not.\n\nTotal carbons: 29?\n\nWait, this can't be right. Molecule A had 28 carbons and B 29? That would mean different formulas. But let's recount.\n\nMolecule B's SMILES:\n\nc1(c(cccc1)-c1ccc(CC2NC(c3cc(Cl)ccc3N(C2=O)C)=O)cc1)[N+]([O-])=O.\n\nCount all 'c' and 'C':\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nc1:1\n\n( c:2\n\n( c:3\n\nc:4\n\nc:5\n\nc:6\n\nc:7\n\n1 )\n\n- c1:8\n\nc1:9\n\nc:10\n\nc:11\n\nc:12\n\n( C:13\n\nC:14\n\n2\n\nN\n\nC:15\n\n( c3:16\n\nc3:17\n\nc:18\n\nc:19\n\n(Cl)\n\nc:20\n\nc:21\n\nc:22\n\nc3:23\n\nN\n\n( C:24\n\n2=O )\n\nC:25\n\n)=O\n\n)\n\ncc1:26 and 27\n\nSo total:\n\nc's: 1 (c1) + 2 (c),3,4,5,6,7 (7 c's in first part), then -c1 (8), c1 (9), c (10), c (11), c (12), then C (13), C (14), C (15), c3 (16), c3 (17), c (18), c (19), c (20), c (21), c (22), c3 (23), C (24), C (25), cc1 (26,27). Then the rest are not carbons.\n\nSo total:\n\nc's: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,26,27 \u2192 total 22 c's.\n\nC's: 13,14,15,24,25 \u2192 5 C's.\n\nTotal carbons: 22 +5 =27?\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. But according to this, Molecule B has 27 carbons. Molecule A had 28. If that's the case, their molecular formulas are different, hence they are different molecules.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me try again for Molecule A.\n\nMolecule A:\n\nCN1C(=O)C(Cc2ccc(-c3ccccc3[N+](=O)[O-])cc2)NC(=O)c2cc(Cl)ccc21.\n\nCount 'C' and 'c':\n\nC (1), N1, C(=O) (2), C (3), (C (4), c2 (5), c (6), c (7), c (8), (-c3 (9), c (10), c (11), c (12), c (13), c (14), c3 (15)), c (16), c (17), c2 (18)), N, C(=O) (19), c2 (20), c (21), c (22), (Cl), c (23), c (24), c (25), c2 (26), 1.\n\nSo carbons: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. Total of 26 carbons.\n\nPlus the C in NC(=O) (19 is counted here). Wait, I think I miscounted earlier.\n\nAlternatively, this is error-prone. The better way is to see that if the two SMILES have different numbers of carbons, then they are different. Let's compare the counts:\n\nMolecule A:\n\n- Nitro group: 1 N, 2 O.\n\n- Chlorine: 1 Cl.\n\n- Carbons: Let's count all C and c.\n\nIn SMILES string:\n\nC (1), C(=O) (2), C (3), C (4), C (5), then multiple c's.\n\nBut this is too time-consuming. Let's instead consider that if the molecular formulas (including other atoms) are different, they are different.\n\nAlternatively, if the SMILES strings are different but represent the same structure, they would have the same canonical SMILES. Since I can't compute that, I need to look for obvious differences.\n\nAnother angle: check if the nitro groups are in the same position. In Molecule A, the nitro is on a benzene that's a substituent, while in B, it's on the main benzene. That would make them different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the SMILES are written differently but the nitro is on the same benzene. For example, in Molecule A, the main structure has a benzene attached to another benzene with nitro, while in B, the nitro is on the main benzene. So different substitution patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the connectivity is the same but the SMILES is written in a different order. For example, starting the SMILES from a different atom can result in a different string but same molecule.\n\nBut without a tool to generate canonical SMILES, it's hard. But given the time I've spent and the differences I notice in substituent positions, I think the molecules are different. So the answer is No.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to determine if Molecule A and Molecule B are the same based on their SMILES strings. \n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing both SMILES. SMILES notation can sometimes represent the same molecule in different ways due to the order of atoms or ring numbering, so it's crucial to parse them correctly.\n\nMolecule A: COc1cc(C=C(C#N)c2ccccn2)ccc1OCc1ccccc1Cl\nBreaking this down, the structure has a central benzene ring (the first 'c1cc...ccc1' part). The substituents on this ring are two methoxy groups (OCH3, represented by 'OC'), a vinyl group (C=C) attached to a cyano group (C#N), and another benzene ring connected via an oxygen (OCc1ccccc1Cl). Wait, maybe I should parse this more carefully.\n\nLet me write out the structure step by step. The first part is COc1cc(...)ccc1OC... So the benzene ring (c1) has methoxy groups (OCH3) at positions 1 and 4 (since the SMILES starts with COc1cc, then after the substituents, there's ccc1OC). The substituent in the middle is C=C(C#N)c2ccccn2. The C=C is a double bond with one side attached to the benzene ring (position 3?), and the other side has a cyano group (C#N) and a pyridine ring (c2ccccn2). Then after the first benzene ring, there's OC followed by another benzene ring (c1ccccc1Cl) with a chlorine substituent. Wait, the OC is connected to the central benzene ring, and then the next part is another benzene ring with Cl. So perhaps the structure is a central benzene with two OCH3 groups, a vinyl group connected to a cyano and a pyridine, and an OCH2 (maybe?) connected to another benzene ring with Cl? Hmm, maybe I need to draw this mentally.\n\nNow Molecule B: c1ccc(Cl)c(COc2c(cc(cc2)C=C(c2ccccn2)C#N)OC)c1\nThis SMILES starts with a benzene ring (c1ccc(...)c(...)c1). The substituents are Cl at position 4 (since it's c1ccc(Cl)...), then a group at position 5 (assuming the first four are positions 1-4, then the next is position 5, but SMILES is written in a linear fashion, so the order might be different). The substituent here is COc2c(...)OC. So a methoxy group (OC) attached to a benzene ring (c2) which has a substituent. Let's parse the inner part: c2c(cc(cc2)...). The benzene ring (c2) has substituents at positions where the SMILES is written as c2c(cc(cc2)...), which might be positions 1, 2, 3, etc. The substituent here is C=C(...)C#N. The double bond is connected to a cyano group and another heterocycle, perhaps the same pyridine ring as in Molecule A: c2ccccn2. \n\nWait, putting this together, the central benzene in Molecule B has a Cl, a CO group (but CO is part of a methoxy?), maybe. Alternatively, the COc2...OC part might be OCH2 connected to another benzene. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should compare the substituents between the two molecules.\n\nIn Molecule A, the substituents on the central benzene are OCH3, OCH2-C6H4-Cl (since OCc1ccccc1Cl is OCH2 connected to a benzene ring with Cl), and the vinyl-cyano-pyridine group. \n\nIn Molecule B, the substituents on the benzene ring are Cl, and the COc2...OC group. Let's see: COc2c(...)OC. Wait, COc2 would be OCH2 connected to the benzene ring c2. The benzene ring c2 has substituents: in the SMILES, it's c2c(cc(cc2)C=C(...)C#N). So the benzene ring (c2) has a substituent at position 2 (if the numbering starts at the first c in c2c(...)), which is a vinyl group (C=C) attached to a cyano (C#N) and a pyridine ring (c2ccccn2). The COc2...OC part might be OCH2 connected to this benzene ring, but I'm not sure. Wait, the entire group is COc2...OC, which might mean OCH2-O-C... Hmm, perhaps the structure is OCH2 connected to a benzene ring which has substituents, but I need to parse this carefully.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central benzene in Molecule B has a Cl, and a substituent that is OCH2 connected to another benzene ring (c2) which has a vinyl-cyano-pyridine group and another OCH3? \n\nWait, in Molecule A, the substituents on the central benzene are two OCH3 groups, a vinyl group (leading to cyano and pyridine), and an OCH2 connected to a benzene with Cl. In Molecule B, the substituents are Cl and a group that is OCH2 connected to a benzene (c2) which has the vinyl-cyano-pyridine group and another OCH3. Wait, but how are the substituents arranged? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the SMILES for Molecule B is a benzene ring where one substituent is Cl, another is a group that starts with COc...OC. Let me parse the SMILES again:\n\nMolecule B: c1ccc(Cl)c(COc2c(cc(cc2)C=C(c3ccccn3)C#N)OC)c1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The benzene ring is c1ccc(Cl)c(...)c1. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The Cl is at position 4 (since after three c's, the fourth is (Cl)). Then the fifth position (after the Cl) is the substituent in the next parentheses: COc2...OC. \n\nThe substituent at position 5 is COc2c(...)OC. That would be OCH2-O-C... Wait, COc is OCH2? No, COc would be O-C-O (since C-O-C is ether). Wait, no: COc would be O-C-O, but COc is actually CH3O- (methoxy) if written as O(C)..., but here it's COc, so maybe it's OCH2? Wait, maybe the COc is part of a larger group. Let's see: COc2c(...)OC. So, the substituent is a chain: C-O-c2 (where c2 is a benzene ring), and then OC (another methoxy group) attached to that benzene ring. \n\nThe benzene ring c2 is written as c2c(cc(cc2)C=C(...)C#N). So the ring is c2 with substituents. The SMILES notation here is a bit tricky. Starting with c2, then c(cc(cc2)... which might mean the ring is built with the substituent at a certain position. Let's parse this:\n\nc2c(...) would start the benzene ring at position 1. Then the next part is (cc(cc2)... which might be positions 2 and 3. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is constructed as follows: c2 is the first carbon, then a branch starts with (cc(cc2)... which might create a substituent. Alternatively, this could be a benzene ring with a substituent at position 1 (from the initial c2c(...)), then the substituent is a chain: cc(cc2). Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to consider that the benzene ring c2 has a substituent at position 1, which is a vinyl group (C=C) attached to a cyano (C#N) and a pyridine ring (c3ccccn3). \n\nSo, putting this together, the substituent on the central benzene (c1) in Molecule B is OCH2-O-C6H3 (with substituents) where the benzene ring (c2) has a vinyl group connected to cyano and pyridine, and another methoxy group (OC). \n\nComparing this to Molecule A, which has two methoxy groups (OCH3) on the central benzene, a vinyl-cyano-pyridine group, and an OCH2 connected to a benzene with Cl. \n\nWait, in Molecule A, the OCc1ccccc1Cl is OCH2 connected to a benzene ring that has Cl. So that's a benzyl chloride group attached via an oxygen (OCH2-C6H4-Cl). In Molecule B, the substituent on the central benzene is OCH2-O-C6H3 (with substituents), but where is the Cl? In Molecule B, the central benzene has a Cl at position 4, and the substituent at position 5 is the OCH2-O-C6H3... group. \n\nSo in Molecule A, the Cl is on the benzyl group attached via OCH2, whereas in Molecule B, the Cl is directly on the central benzene ring. Therefore, the positions of the Cl are different. \n\nIf that's the case, then the two molecules are not the same because the Cl is in different locations. In Molecule A, Cl is on a benzene ring that's part of an OCH2 substituent, while in Molecule B, Cl is directly attached to the central benzene ring. Therefore, the answer should be No.",
