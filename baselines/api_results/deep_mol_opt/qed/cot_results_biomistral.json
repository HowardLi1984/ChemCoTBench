Additionally, the number of H-bond donors and acceptors in the source molecule is high, which could make it more likely to interact with other proteins and form unwanted crystals, leading to lower solubility and stability in vivo. Finally, the presence of a carbonyl group and multiple heteroatoms in the scaffold could increase its lipophilicity, making it less likely to be absorbed across biological membranes.\",\n\"Optimization for Source Molecule\": \"To optimize the source molecule, the objective is to improve its QED score without altering its pharmacological activity. One way to achieve this is to reduce the number of H-bond donors and acceptors by modifying the functional groups present in the molecule. For example, replacing the hydroxyl group with a halogen atom would eliminate one H-bond donor and potentially increase the lipophilicity of the compound. Similarly, removing the CONH2 group would eliminate one H-bond acceptor. Another approach is to modify the linkage between the aromatic rings and the urea moiety, as this could potentially reduce the lipophilicity of the compound. For instance, replacing the N-nitrogen atom in the amide bond with an oxygen atom would break the aromaticity of the ring and potentially increase its polarity.

The presence of a hydroxyl group on the quinoline ring may be responsible for the low solubility, as well as its poor Papp value, which is associated with low permeability through Caco-2 cells. The high logP value of the compound indicates that it is likely to have low bioavailability due to limited absorption into the systemic circulation.

Additionally, the thiourea moiety on the quinoline ring may also contribute to the polar nature of the compound and negatively impact its pharmacokinetic properties.

The compound does not have a well-defined pharmacophore, and its bioavailability and permeability may be affected due to its high molecular weight and low number of rotatable bonds.\",\n\"Limitation in Source Molecule for Property\": \"The presence of multiple functional groups can lead to poor drug-like properties, such as poor oral absorption and reduced bioavailability. The compound also lacks a defined pharmacophore which affects its ability to bind to protein targets.\",\n\"Optimization for Source Molecule\": \"To optimize the source molecule, we can remove some of the functional groups and simplify the structure. One way to do this would be to convert the carboxylic acid group into an amide or urea group. This would reduce the number of functional groups and make the compound more hydrophobic, improving its oral absorption and bioavailability. We could also consider removing one of the hydroxyl groups and replacing it with a methoxy or ethoxy group to further improve the molecule's lipophilicity.\",\n\"Final Target Molecule\": \"CNC(=O)N(C)CC(=O)CN1C2CCC1CC(NC(=O)N(C)C)C2.\""
