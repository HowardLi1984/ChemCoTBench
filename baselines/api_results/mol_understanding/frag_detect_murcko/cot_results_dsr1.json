        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction problem. The input SMILES is O=C(c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1)N1CCN(c2ccccc2F)CC1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that the Murcko scaffold involves retaining only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So, all side chains and functional groups attached to the rings should be removed.\n\nLooking at the input structure, I'll break it down. The molecule has a central amide group (O=C-N) connecting two aromatic rings. Let's parse the SMILES:\n\n- The left part is O=C(c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1). Here, the carbonyl group (O=C) is attached to a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1). There's a substituent on the benzene ring: -c2ccccc2, which is another benzene ring connected by a single bond. But wait, the Murcko scaffold should keep the rings and connecting bonds. So, the two benzene rings here are connected via a single bond. But the connecting bond might be part of the scaffold if it's between two rings.\n\nWait, the left part is a benzene ring (c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1). The substituent on this benzene is another benzene ring. So, those two rings connected by a single bond would be part of the scaffold. However, the carbonyl group (O=C) is attached to the first benzene. Since that's a functional group (amide), it should be removed. So the left side's benzene rings connected by a single bond would remain, but the carbonyl and the amide nitrogen would be removed.\n\nThen the central part is N1CCN(...)CC1. This is a piperazine ring. The nitrogen in the piperazine is connected to another benzene ring with a fluorine substituent (c2ccccc2F). The fluorine is a substituent, so it should be removed. The benzene ring connected to the piperazine's nitrogen would remain, but the fluorine would be stripped.\n\nPutting it all together: The scaffold should include the two benzene rings connected by a single bond (from the left side), connected via a bond (maybe from the amide's position) to the piperazine ring, which is connected to another benzene ring. Wait, no. The original structure is O=C-(benzene with substituent benzene)-N-(piperazine)-N-(fluorobenzene). But when removing functional groups, the amide (O=C-N) would be replaced by a single bond between the benzene and the piperazine. Similarly, the fluorine on the benzene would be removed.\n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold process: Remove all side chains and functional groups. So, any atom that's not part of a ring or a connecting bond between rings is removed. So, any substituents on rings (like the fluorine) are removed. Also, any chains connecting rings are kept if they are part of the connecting structure.\n\nSo, the original molecule has:\n\n- A benzene ring (left) connected via a single bond to another benzene ring (as a substituent). But wait, the left benzene ring has a substituent which is another benzene ring. Wait, in SMILES, the left part is O=C(c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1). The benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1) has a substituent at one of its positions, which is another benzene ring (-c2ccccc2). So, those two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. Then, the amide group (O=C-N) connects this to the piperazine ring (N1CCN...CC1), which is connected to another benzene ring (c2ccccc2F), but that benzene has a fluorine substituent.\n\nSo, breaking down:\n\n1. The left side has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. These are both part of the scaffold.\n2. The amide group (O=C-N) connects the left benzene to the piperazine. Since the amide is a functional group, it's removed. The connecting bond between the benzene and the piperazine's nitrogen would be retained as part of the scaffold. Wait, but the nitrogen in the amide is part of the piperazine ring. So, the piperazine (six-membered ring with two nitrogens) is part of the scaffold. So, the benzene rings connected via the piperazine would be part of the scaffold.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nLeft benzene connected via a single bond to another benzene, then connected via the amide (O=C-N) to the piperazine ring, which is connected to a fluorobenzene.\n\nBut in the scaffold, we need to retain all rings and the connecting bonds. So, the left two benzene rings connected by a single bond (so that's part of the scaffold), then connected via a bond (from the amide's position) to the piperazine ring, which is connected to the benzene (without the fluorine).\n\nSo, the fluorobenzene becomes a benzene ring in the scaffold. The piperazine is a ring, so it's retained. The connecting bonds between the benzene rings and the piperazine would be retained.\n\nSo, the scaffold would be:\n\nBenzene connected to benzene (from left), connected via a bond to the piperazine ring, which is connected to another benzene.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scaffold is three rings: two benzene rings connected by a single bond, connected via a bond to the piperazine, which is connected to another benzene.\n\nBut how are they connected? Let's reconstruct:\n\nOriginal structure: The left benzene (with substituent benzene) is attached to the carbonyl group, which is attached to the piperazine's nitrogen. The piperazine's other nitrogen is attached to the fluorobenzene.\n\nIn the scaffold, all functional groups are removed. So, the carbonyl (O=C) is removed, leaving the benzene connected directly to the piperazine's nitrogen. The fluorine is removed from the benzene on the right.\n\nSo, the scaffold would consist of:\n\n- Benzene ring A connected via a single bond to benzene ring B (from the left substituent).\n- Benzene ring A is connected via a single bond to the piperazine ring (since the amide group is removed, the bond from the benzene to the piperazine's nitrogen remains).\n- The piperazine ring is connected via a single bond to benzene ring C (the former fluorobenzene, now without F).\n\nSo, the entire scaffold is three rings connected in a chain: benzene-benzene-piperazine-benzene? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait, the left part is benzene ring A (c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1) connected to another benzene ring B. Then, the carbonyl connects to the piperazine. So, in the scaffold, after removing the carbonyl, benzene ring A is connected directly to the piperazine's nitrogen. Then, the piperazine's other nitrogen is connected to benzene ring C (without F). So, the scaffold is benzene B connected to benzene A, which is connected to piperazine, which is connected to benzene C.\n\nSo, the structure would be c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 connected to N1CCN(c3ccccc3)CC1. Wait, but how exactly are they connected? Let me try to write the SMILES.\n\nOriginal SMILES: O=C(c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1)N1CCN(c2ccccc2F)CC1.\n\nAfter removing the O=C and the fluorine:\n\nThe left benzene (c1ccc(-c2ccccc2)cc1) becomes c1ccc(c2ccccc2)cc1, which is a benzene ring (c1ccc(cc1) with a substituent benzene (c2ccccc2) connected via a single bond. So, that's a biphenyl group: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2.\n\nThen, the amide nitrogen is part of the piperazine ring. So, the connection between the left benzene and the piperazine is via the nitrogen. So, in the scaffold, the benzene (biphenyl) is connected to the piperazine ring. The piperazine (N1CCN...CC1) has another nitrogen connected to a benzene ring (originally with F, now removed). So, the benzene connected to the piperazine is now c3ccccc3.\n\nPutting it all together, the SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2N3CCN(c4ccccc4)CC3.\n\nWait, let's check. The biphenyl part is c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2. Then, the piperazine is N3CCN(c4ccccc4)CC3. The biphenyl is connected to the piperazine's nitrogen. So the full SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2.N3CCN(c4ccccc4)CC3. Wait, but are they connected by a bond? Yes, because in the original structure, the biphenyl's benzene is connected via the amide's nitrogen to the piperazine. So in the scaffold, that nitrogen is part of the piperazine ring, and the biphenyl is attached to it. So the correct SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2N3CCN(c4ccccc4)CC3.\n\nWait, but the original connection was O=C(...)N1CCN... So the N in the piperazine is connected to the carbonyl. After removing the carbonyl, that N is connected directly to the benzene. So the benzene is attached to the N in the piperazine. So the SMILES would have the biphenyl connected to the N of the piperazine. So the SMILES is the biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) connected to N3, which is part of the piperazine ring: N3(CCN(c4ccccc4)CC3). So combining these: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2N3CCN(c4ccccc4)CC3.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me verify if this is a valid SMILES. The biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is connected to the piperazine's nitrogen (N3), which is part of the ring N3-C-C-N(c4ccccc4)-C-C-3. The other nitrogen in the piperazine is connected to the benzene (c4ccccc4). So the scaffold has three rings: two benzene rings connected by a single bond (biphenyl), a piperazine ring, and another benzene connected to the piperazine. All substituents like fluorine and the carbonyl are removed.\n\nSo the final SMILES should be c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2N3CCN(c4ccccc4)CC3.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to find the Murcko scaffold for the given SMILES: Cc1ccc(-c2nnc(SCc3ccccc3)o2)c(O)c1. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure. The main part seems to be a benzene ring (the c1ccc...c1 part). Attached to that ring is a substituent: -c2nnc(SCc3ccccc3)o2. That substituent has another ring, a thiophene or similar? Wait, the substituent is a ring system: the part after the dash is a ring with two nitrogens, a sulfur, and an oxygen. Let me visualize that. The c2nnc(...)o2 suggests a five-membered ring with two nitrogens and an oxygen. So maybe it's a 1,2,4-oxadiazole or something similar. Then, attached to that ring is a sulfur connected to another benzene (ccccc3), which is a SCc3ccccc3 group. So the substituent has a five-membered heterocycle connected to a benzene via a sulfur and a methylene (CH2) group.\n\nNow, the main benzene ring also has a methyl group (Cc1...) and a hydroxyl group (c(O)c1). The Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and functional groups, keeping only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So the main benzene ring is part of the scaffold. The substituent attached to it is a five-membered ring (the oxadiazole-like part) connected via a single bond. The SCc3ccccc3 is a side chain on that heterocycle, so that should be removed. So the scaffold would include the main benzene ring and the five-membered heterocycle connected directly to it. The methyl (C) and hydroxyl (O) groups on the benzene are substituents, so those get removed. Similarly, the sulfur and benzene part on the heterocycle are side chains, so they are removed.\n\nSo the main rings are the benzene (c1ccc...c1) and the five-membered heterocycle (c2nnco2). The connecting bond is between the benzene and the heterocycle. So after removing the substituents, the scaffold should be the benzene ring connected directly to the five-membered ring (without the side chains). The original substituent on the benzene is -c2nnc(SCc3...)o2. Removing the S-C-CH2-benzene part, the heterocycle becomes c2nnc([nothing])o2, but wait, the connecting bond is part of the ring. Wait, the substituent on the benzene is a ring system. So the Murcko scaffold should retain that ring system connected via the bond. So the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected to the five-membered ring (c1ccc(-c2nnco2)c...). But wait, the original substituent is -c2nnc(SCc3...)o2. The SCc3ccccc3 is attached to the heterocycle. So the heterocycle's structure is c2nnc(S...)o2. Removing the S and the following groups, the heterocycle becomes c2nnc([bond])o2. But in the scaffold, all atoms must be part of rings or connecting bonds. The connecting bond between the benzene and the heterocycle is part of the scaffold. The heterocycle itself is a five-membered ring (two nitrogens, one oxygen, and two carbons). So the scaffold would consist of the benzene ring connected via a single bond to the five-membered heterocycle. The methyl and hydroxyl on the benzene are removed, as well as the sulfur and benzene on the heterocycle. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(-c2nnco2)cc1. Wait, but in the original SMILES, the substituent on the benzene is -c2nnc(SC...)o2. So in the scaffold, the heterocycle is just the ring without the sulfur substituent. So the heterocycle would be n1ncco1? Let me check. The original substituent is c2nnc(SC...)o2. If we remove the SC... part, the heterocycle becomes c2nnc([nothing])o2. But the ring must be closed. So the structure is a five-membered ring where one of the positions is connected to the benzene. The ring atoms are c, n, n, c, o. So the order would be: starting from the benzene, the connection is to a carbon (c2), then two nitrogens (nn), another carbon connected to oxygen (o). So the ring would be c2nnco2, making the heterocycle O1C=NN=C1? Or maybe O1C=NNC=C1. Wait, the SMILES notation for the heterocycle. Let me think. The substituent is -c2nnc(SCc3ccccc3)o2. The heterocycle is a ring where the atoms are c2 (connected to benzene), n, n, c (connected to S), o (connected back to c2). So the ring is c2nnc(S...)o2. So the ring closure is between the first c (c2) and the o (o2). So the ring is c2nnc...o2. So the order would be c2, n, n, c, o2. So the ring is c2nnco2. That forms a five-membered ring: c2 connected to n, which is connected to another n, then to c (which has the S group), then to o, which connects back to c2. So the scaffold's heterocycle is c2nnco2, but without the S group. So the heterocycle is just c2nnco2. So the entire scaffold would be the benzene ring (with the substituent removed except for the heterocycle) connected to that heterocycle. The benzene in the original SMILES is Cc1ccc(-...)c(O)c1. Removing the methyl (C) and hydroxyl (O), the benzene becomes c1ccc(-...)cc1. So combining them, the scaffold SMILES is c1ccc(-c2nnco2)cc1. Let me check if that's correct. The rings are the benzene and the five-membered ring (which is a 1,2,4-oxadiazole?), connected by a single bond. That seems to fit the Murcko definition. So the output should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc(-c2nnco2)cc1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is Cc1c(-c2ccc(O)cc2)n(Cc2ccc(O)cc2)c2ccc(O)cc12. First, I need to visualize the structure. The molecule has a central ring, probably. Let me parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nStarting with \"Cc1c...\", the first part is a carbon (methyl group) attached to a ring atom 1. Then there's a branch: -c2ccc(O)cc2. That's a benzene ring with an oxygen substituent. So, the central ring (atom 1) has a methyl group and another benzene ring attached. Next, there's an 'n', which is a nitrogen in a ring. The nitrogen is connected to another benzene ring via a Cc2ccc(O)cc2 group. Then there's a c2ccc(O)cc12 part, which forms another benzene ring fused to the central ring.\n\nSo the central structure seems to be a bicyclic system with a nitrogen. The substituents are the methyl groups and the benzene rings attached via oxygen. According to Murcko's definition, I need to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. That means removing the methyl (C), the oxygen-linked benzene rings, and any other non-ring atoms.\n\nLooking at the central core: the rings connected directly without any side chains. The original structure has a central ring with a nitrogen, fused to another benzene ring. The substituents are the methyl and the two benzene rings attached via the oxygen. Removing those, the scaffold should be the fused bicyclic system consisting of the rings connected by the nitrogen and the fused benzene. Let me check if all the connecting bonds are part of the rings. The central ring is probably a five-membered ring with nitrogen, fused to a six-membered benzene ring. The connecting bonds are part of the ring systems, so they stay. The side chains (methyl, benzene-O-) are removed.\n\nSo the Murcko scaffold would be the fused bicyclic system. The SMILES for that would be c1c2c(nc3ccc(O)cc3)c3ccc(O)cc3c1c2. Wait, but the oxygen atoms are part of the substituents. Wait, the original substituents have O in the benzene rings. But in the scaffold, we remove exocyclic groups. So any oxygen attached to the benzene rings that's part of the side chain should be removed. Wait, the input has -O- in the benzene rings attached via the central ring. Wait, the substituent is -c2ccc(O)cc2. So that benzene has an O in the para position. But when we remove that substituent, the oxygen is part of the substituent's benzene ring. So the scaffold's rings are the central bicyclic system without any substituents. Therefore, the scaffold would be the central fused rings without any substituents. Let me draw it again: the central ring is a five-membered ring (with nitrogen) fused to a benzene. The original molecule has substituents on the central ring: methyl and the benzene rings. Removing those, the scaffold is the fused rings. So the SMILES would be the central rings connected without substituents. Let's reconstruct the SMILES. The central ring has the nitrogen. The fused benzene would be part of the scaffold. So the scaffold's SMILES is c1c2ccccc2n(c2ccccc2)c1. Wait, but the original structure might have a more complex fusion. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cc2c(cc1)N(C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C24. Hmm, maybe I need to re-express the rings properly. Alternatively, considering the actual structure: the central ring might be a five-membered ring with nitrogen, fused to a benzene. The substituents are the methyl and the two benzene rings via oxygen. So after removing substituents, the scaffold is the five-membered ring (with N) fused to a benzene. Wait, but the original SMILES might have two fused rings. Let me parse again: The SMILES is Cc1c(-c2ccc(O)cc2)n(Cc2ccc(O)cc2)c2ccc(O)cc12. Breaking it down: the main ring is c1...c2ccc(O)cc12. That's a fused ring system where atom 1 is part of two rings. The central core would be the two fused rings (the main ring and the c2ccc... part). The substituents are the methyl (C), the two -c2ccc(O)cc2 groups attached via the central ring's atoms. So removing all substituents (methyl, the benzene rings with O), the scaffold is the fused bicyclic system. So the SMILES would be the fused rings without substituents. Let me check if the connecting bonds are part of the rings. In the original, the central ring has a nitrogen connected to another benzene via a single bond (as part of the substituent). Wait, no: in the SMILES, the central ring is built with the nitrogen. Let me write the scaffold. The main ring is a five-membered ring with atoms c1, c, n, c, and another c. The c1 is connected to a methyl (C) and a benzene substituent (-c2ccc(O)cc2). The nitrogen (n) is connected to another benzene substituent. Then, the central ring is fused to another benzene ring (c2ccc(O)cc12). Wait, the part at the end: c2ccc(O)cc12. That's a benzene ring where atom 1 is part of the central ring and the benzene. So the central ring is fused to this benzene. So the scaffold includes this fused benzene. The other substituents (methyl, the two benzene rings attached via the central ring's atoms) are removed. Therefore, the scaffold is the fused bicyclic system consisting of the five-membered ring (with nitrogen) fused to a benzene. The SMILES for that would be c1c2ccccc2n(c2ccccc2)c1. Wait, but maybe the actual structure is a benzimidazole-like scaffold. Let me count the atoms. The central ring has atoms c1, c, n, c, and the fused benzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzofuran or similar. Wait, the original SMILES has a nitrogen in the central ring. Let's reconstruct the scaffold. The main ring is c1c(...)n(...)c(...)c2ccc...12. The 'c2ccc...12' part implies that atom 1 is part of both the central ring and the benzene ring. So the scaffold would be a bicyclic system where a five-membered ring (with N) is fused to a benzene. So the SMILES would be c1c2ccccc2n([*])c2ccccc12, but without the substituents. Wait, but in the original SMILES, after removing substituents, the scaffold should have only the rings and the connecting bonds. So the correct SMILES would be c1c2ccccc2n(c2ccccc2)c1. Let me validate this. The main ring is a five-membered ring: c1 attached to another c (part of a benzene ring), then n connected to a benzene (c2ccccc2), then back to c1. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the central ring is a six-membered ring? Let me parse again: The SMILES is Cc1c(-c2ccc(O)cc2)n(Cc2ccc(O)cc2)c2ccc(O)cc12. The main ring starts with c1. The atoms in the main ring would be c1, c, n, c, and then the fused benzene (c2ccc(O)cc12). Wait, the 'c2ccc(O)cc12' part: the '12' at the end means that atom 1 is connected to atom 2. So the main ring is c1 connected to c (atom 2?), which is connected to n, then another c (atom 3?), then to the fused benzene (c2ccc...). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe using a structure visualizer would help, but since I can't do that, I have to rely on SMILES parsing. The key is to identify all rings and remove substituents. The substituents here are the methyl groups (C), the benzene rings attached via the central ring's atoms (the -c2ccc(O)cc2 groups), and the oxygen atoms. The scaffold should retain only the ring systems and the bonds connecting them. The oxygen is part of the substituent's benzene rings, so those benzene rings are considered substituents and should be removed. The fused benzene (from the c2ccc(O)cc12 part) is part of the ring system and should stay. Wait, but in that part, the oxygen is part of the fused benzene? No, in the original SMILES, the 'c2ccc(O)cc12' would form a benzene ring where atom 1 is part of the central ring and the benzene. However, the 'O' is in that benzene ring. But in the scaffold, we need to remove any functional groups. Wait, but the oxygen is part of the ring? No, in the benzene ring, the oxygen would be a substituent. Wait, the SMILES part is 'c2ccc(O)cc12', which means positions 1 and 2 of the benzene are connected to other atoms. The 'O' is in position 4 (since the SMILES is c2ccc(O)cc12: positions are 2 (start), then next atoms are 3, 4 (O), 5, 6 (connected to 1). So the benzene ring has an -O- substituent. But since that benzene is part of the fused system (connected to atom 1), the oxygen is a substituent on the benzene. Therefore, in the scaffold, we remove that oxygen. So the fused benzene in the scaffold would be without the oxygen. So the scaffold's fused benzene is just a benzene ring. Therefore, the scaffold would be the central ring (five-membered with nitrogen) fused to a benzene, with no substituents. The SMILES would then be c1c2ccccc2n(c2ccccc2)c1. But I need to ensure the correct connectivity. Let me try to write the SMILES properly. The central ring is a five-membered ring: atoms 1 (carbon), 2 (carbon connected to fused benzene), 3 (nitrogen), 4 (carbon connected to benzene via substituent, which we remove), and 5 (carbon connected to the fused benzene). The fused benzene is atoms 2, 5, and others. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1c2ccccc2n(c3ccccc3)c1. Wait, but maybe the nitrogen is part of a six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps the scaffold is a benzimidazole-like structure. But without the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cc2c(cc1)N(C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C24. But I'm not sure. Let me count the atoms again. The original SMILES has a central ring with a nitrogen. The fused benzene is part of the scaffold. The other benzene rings attached via the central ring's atoms are substituents. So removing those, the scaffold is the central bicyclic system. Therefore, the correct SMILES for the Murcko scaffold should be c1c2ccccc2n(c2ccccc2)c1. But let me check if the rings are properly closed. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1ccc2c(c1)n(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc21. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the correct SMILES is c1c(-c2ccc(O)cc2)n(C)c2ccc(O)cc12 without the substituents. Wait, no. The substituents are the parts attached via single bonds. The Murcko scaffold retains only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So any atom that is part of a ring stays. The substituents attached via single bonds are removed. So in the input SMILES, the parts like -c2ccc(O)cc2 are substituents attached to the central ring. The fused benzene (c2ccc(O)cc12) is part of the ring system. Wait, but the 'O' in that part is a substituent on the benzene ring. So in the scaffold, that oxygen should be removed. Therefore, the fused benzene in the scaffold is just a benzene without the oxygen. So the scaffold would be the central ring fused to a benzene, with the nitrogen in the central ring. So the SMILES would be c1c2ccccc2n([*])c2ccccc12, but without the [*] (which are substituents). So removing the substituents, the SMILES is c1c2ccccc2n(c3ccccc3)c1. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct SMILES is c1c2ccc(O)cc2n(Cc2ccc(O)cc2)c2ccc(O)cc12, but without the substituents. Wait, no. The substituents are the parts attached via single bonds. The fused rings are part of the scaffold. So the correct scaffold should be the two fused rings: one with nitrogen and the benzene. Let me try to write the SMILES without substituents. The central ring is c1c(nc2ccccc2)c2ccccc12. Wait, that might be it. Let me break it down: c1 is connected to a c, which is connected to an n, which is connected to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2), and then back to c1 via the fused benzene (c2ccccc12). So the SMILES would be c1c(nc2ccccc2)c2ccccc12. But I need to check the ring closures. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cc2ccccc2n(c2ccccc2)c1. Let me try to write it step by step. Start with c1 (atom 1), connected to c (atom 2), which is connected to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2, atoms 3-8), then n (atom 9), connected to another benzene (c3ccccc3, atoms 10-15), and then back to atom 1 via another benzene. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1c2ccccc2n(c2ccccc2)c2ccccc12. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is c1ccc2c(c1)n(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc21. But I need to ensure all rings are properly closed. Alternatively, considering the original input, after removing substituents, the scaffold would have the fused rings. The original has a central ring with a nitrogen, fused to a benzene. The substituents are the methyl and the two benzene rings attached via oxygen. So the scaffold is the fused bicyclic system. The SMILES for that would be c1c2ccccc2n(c2ccccc2)c1. Let me count the atoms. The main ring is a five-membered ring: 1 (C), 2 (C connected to benzene), 3 (N connected to benzene), 4 (C connected to fused benzene), and 5 (C part of fused benzene). The fused benzene is atoms 2,5,6,7,8,9. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Another approach: the original molecule's scaffold should retain all rings and the bonds that connect them. Any substituent (like methyl, benzene rings attached via single bonds) are removed. So the input molecule has a central bicyclic system (two fused rings) with substituents. The scaffold is the bicyclic system itself. Therefore, the SMILES should represent those fused rings without substituents. Given that, the correct SMILES is c1c2ccc(O)cc2n(C)c2ccc(O)cc12 but without the O and the C substituents. Wait, but the oxygen is part of the fused benzene? No, in the original SMILES, the oxygen is part of the substituent's benzene. The fused benzene in the scaffold is just a benzene ring without substituents. So the scaffold's SMILES would be c1c2ccccc2n(c2ccccc2)c1. That seems plausible. So the final answer should be that SMILES.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is CCC(C)(C)Nc1c(C#N)cnc2cnc(NCc3cccnc3)cc12. First, I need to identify the ring systems. The main structure has a central ring. Let me parse the SMILES.\n\nStarting from the nitrogen (N), there's a chain (CCC(C)(C)) attached. That's a side chain, so remove it. Then, the central ring has a cyano group (C#N) attached; that's a functional group, so take that off. Next, there's another substituent with NCc3cccnc3. The NC part is a side chain leading to another ring (c3cccnc3), which is a pyridine ring. Since that's connected via a chain (CC), that entire part (NCc3...) is an exocyclic group. Remove that as well.\n\nSo, the remaining structure should be the core rings and connecting bonds. The central part is a bicyclic system: the first ring (c1c...cnc2) connected to a second ring (cc12). After stripping the side chains and functional groups, the scaffold would be the fused rings without the substituents. Putting that into SMILES: c1c2cncc2cnc1. Wait, let me check again. The original structure after removing substituents should have the two fused rings connected by a single bond. Hmm, maybe it's c1cc2cnc(N)cc2cn1? No, wait, need to reconstruct the rings properly. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is a bicyclic system with two connected rings. Let me draw it mentally. The core is a quinazoline or similar. Wait, the original molecule has c1c(C#N)cnc2cnc(...)cc12. Removing the C#N and the NCc3... parts leaves c1ccnc2cnccc12. Combining the rings, the Murcko scaffold would be c1cc2cnccc2cnc1. Let me confirm. Yes, the rings are fused with the connecting bonds. So the correct SMILES should be c1ccc2cnccc2cn1. Wait, perhaps I need to number the atoms correctly. Alternatively, the scaffold might be c1cnc2cnccc2c1. Let me check again. The original SMILES is CCC(C)(C)Nc1c(C#N)cnc2cnc(NCc3cccnc3)cc12. Removing all substituents: the N attached to the ring (from Nc1...) becomes part of the ring? No, the N here is part of the side chain. Wait, in the SMILES, the 'Nc1' indicates that the nitrogen is connected to the ring carbon 1. So that nitrogen is part of the side chain (the CCC... part), so removing that, the ring starts at c1. The core rings are the c1c...cnc2cnc(...)cc12. After removing substituents (C#N, NCc3...), the core would be c1ccnc2cnccc12. So combining the two rings, the scaffold is c1ccc2cnccc2cn1. But perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cnc2cnccc2c1. Let me use a tool or think of the structure. The rings are connected via a single bond? Or fused? The original SMILES has cc12, indicating that the two rings share two adjacent atoms, making them fused. So the scaffold would be a bicyclic system where two rings are fused. For example, if the first ring is six-membered and the second is five-membered, but in this case, let's count. The first ring (c1c(C#N)cnc2...) has atoms c1, c(C#N), c, n, c2. Then connected to cc12, so the second ring is c2, n, c, c, c1. Wait, maybe it's a 6-5 fused system. Alternatively, perhaps the scaffold is a 6-6 fused ring. Let me try to write the SMILES correctly. Without substituents, the core is c1c(cnc2cnccc12). So, removing the substituents, the scaffold SMILES would be c1cc2cnccc2cnc1. Wait, that makes a fused ring where the first ring is six-membered (c1c...cnc1) and the second is five-membered? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is c1cnc2cnccc2c1. Testing this: that's a five-membered ring (c1cnc2) fused to a six-membered ring (c2cnccc2). Hmm, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cc2c(nc1)cnc2. Let me try numbering. Alternatively, the correct Murcko scaffold is c1cnc2cnccc12. Let me check the connectivity. Original structure after removing side chains: the rings are connected as c1c...cnc2cnc(...)cc12. So the scaffold would be c1ccc2cnccc2cn1. No, that might not be right. Alternatively, the correct SMILES is c1cnc2cnccc2c1. Yes, that forms two fused rings: one five-membered (c1cnc2) and the other six-membered (c2cnccc2). So the final answer should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1cnc2cnccc2c1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a SMILES string and wants the Murcko scaffold. The input is CCN(CC)S(=O)(=O)c1ccc(C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of a Murcko scaffold. It's the framework consisting of all rings and the connecting bonds between them, with all side chains and functional groups removed. So, I need to strip off any substituents that aren't part of the ring systems or the linkers between rings.\n\nLooking at the SMILES structure. The main part seems to be a benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1). Attached to that is a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is connected to two ethyl groups (CCN(CC)). But the sulfonyl is part of the substituent here, not a ring. Wait, no, the sulfonyl is directly attached to the benzene. So maybe the benzene is one ring. Then there's another part: C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2. The n2ccnc2 is a piperazine ring? Or wait, n2ccnc2 would be a five-membered ring with two nitrogens? Let me draw it out. The n2ccnc2 part: starting with N, then two carbons, another N, and a carbon. So that's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens, like imidazole? So the ring is N1C=CN=C1. So that's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens adjacent to each other. So the main benzene ring is connected via a carbonyl (C=O) group to a chain: NCCC (which is a propyl chain) leading to that imidazole ring.\n\nSo the Murcko scaffold would retain the benzene ring and the imidazole ring if they are connected through the linker. Wait, the connecting bonds between rings are also kept. So in the original molecule, the benzene ring is connected to the sulfonyl group, which is connected to the ethyl groups. But the sulfonyl is a substituent, not a ring. So the benzene ring has a sulfonyl substituent, which is not part of any ring. Therefore, the sulfonyl group would be removed. Similarly, the carbonyl group (C=O) connected to the benzene is part of a side chain leading to the imidazole ring. Wait, the benzene has a substituent at position c1ccc(...)cc1. The substituent is S(=O)(=O) connected to N(CC)CC. But the S is part of a substituent, not a ring. So the benzene ring is the main ring here. Then, the other substituent on the benzene is C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2. Let's break that down: the benzene is connected to a carbonyl (C=O), which is connected to an amine (N), then a propyl chain (CCC), then the imidazole ring (n2ccnc2). So the imidazole ring is connected via a propyl chain and a carbonyl to the benzene. But the Murcko scaffold includes all rings and the connecting bonds. So the benzene and the imidazole rings would be part of the scaffold if they are connected via the shortest path. Wait, the connecting bonds are the bonds that link the rings. So the path from benzene to imidazole is C(=O)-N-CCC. The propyl chain (CCC) is part of the linker. So the connecting bonds would be the single bonds between the benzene and the carbonyl, then the amine, then the propyl chain, then the imidazole. But in Murcko's definition, the connecting bonds are the ones that form the shortest path between rings. So if the benzene is connected via a chain (like the propyl) to the imidazole, then that chain is considered a linker and included in the scaffold. But wait, the Murcko scaffold is supposed to remove all side chains. Wait, no, the linker between rings is kept. So any atoms that are part of the path connecting two rings are retained. So in this case, the benzene is connected via the carbonyl, then N, then three carbons (CCC), then the imidazole. That's a four-atom linker (C(=O)-N-CH2-CH2-CH2). But the linker between rings would include all the atoms in the path. So the scaffold would be benzene connected via a carbonyl, amine, and three carbons to the imidazole. But wait, maybe I need to check if those atoms are part of the rings or part of the connecting bonds. Alternatively, the Murcko scaffold is formed by removing all side chains, which are branches off the ring-linker framework. So in the original molecule, the benzene has two substituents: the sulfonyl group (which is a substituent) and the carbonyl group leading to the imidazole. The sulfonyl is a substituent, so removed. The carbonyl group is part of the linker to the imidazole, so kept. Then the amine and propyl chain are part of the linker between the benzene and the imidazole. So those would be kept. Therefore, the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via C(=O)-N-CCC- to the imidazole ring. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2)cc1. Wait, but the original SMILES has S(=O)(=O)c1ccc... So the S part is attached to the benzene. But in the scaffold, that substituent is removed. So the benzene in the scaffold has only the substituent that's part of the linker to another ring. So the benzene ring in the scaffold would have the C(=O) substituent, which is part of the linker to the imidazole. The other substituents (like the S(=O)(=O) attached to N(CC)CC) are side chains and are removed. So the resulting scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via the carbonyl-amine-propyl chain to the imidazole. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2)cc1. Let me check that. The benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1), with a substituent at position where the S was. Wait, in the original, the benzene has two substituents: the S(=O)(=O) and the C(=O)... So in the scaffold, the S substituent is removed, leaving only the C(=O) substituent. So the benzene in the scaffold has one substituent: the C(=O) group. Then the rest of the chain (NCCCn2ccnc2) is part of the linker. So the scaffold is benzene connected via C(=O)-N-CH2CH2CH2- to the imidazole ring. The imidazole is n2ccnc2, which is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2)cc1. Let me write that out: the benzene (c1ccc(\u2026)cc1) with the substituent C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2. The N is connected to CCC (propane chain) leading to the imidazole. So the entire linker is included. Therefore, the output scaffold should be c1ccc(C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2)cc1. Wait, but the original substituent on the benzene was S(=O)(=O)c1... and the C(=O)... So after removing the S substituent, the benzene has only the C(=O) substituent. So yes, the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2)cc1. Let me check if that's correct. Another way to think: the Murcko scaffold retains all rings and the connecting atoms. The rings here are benzene and imidazole. The connecting atoms are the carbonyl, amine, and three carbons. So those are part of the scaffold. Any other substituents (like the sulfonyl group and the ethyl groups on the S) are removed. So the final SMILES is c1ccc(C(=O)NCCCn2ccnc2)cc1. I think that's right.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is COc1cc2c(cc1OC)-c1cc(Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)nc(=O)n1CC2. First, I need to identify the ring systems and the connecting bonds. The Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and functional groups.\n\nLooking at the structure, there are two benzene rings connected by a bridge. The substituents like methoxy groups (OC), the amide group (nc(=O)), and the chlorine atoms (Cl) attached to the rings are side chains or functional groups. The amine group (N) connecting to another chlorinated benzene ring is also a substituent. The exocyclic double bonds or other attachments need to be stripped away.\n\nSo, the main rings are the two benzene rings connected via a bridge. The chlorinated benzene attached via an amine is a side chain, so that gets removed. The methoxy groups (OC) on the benzene rings are substituents and should be taken off. The amide group (nc(=O)) becomes a ring atom once the substituents are removed. The connecting bonds between the rings remain. The final scaffold should be the fused ring system without any substituents. Let me draw this mentally: the core is the bicyclic system with the two benzene rings connected by a bridge, and the other rings or substituents removed. The SMILES would be c1cc2c(cc1)-c1ccccc1CC2. Wait, maybe checking the exact connectivity. The original has a bridge between the two benzene rings via CC2. So the Murcko scaffold is the two benzene rings bridged by the two-carbon chain. So the SMILES should be C1CC2=CC3=C(C=C2C1)C4=C(NC5=C(C=CC=C5Cl)Cl)C(=O)NC4=C3. Hmm, maybe I need to simplify. Alternatively, perhaps the core is the bicyclo structure with the two aromatic rings connected by the bridge. Let me re-express: the main scaffold is the fused bicyclic system without any substituents. So removing all the OCH3, Cl, and the amide group, leaving just the rings and the bridge. The correct SMILES would be c1cc2c(cc1)c1ccccc1CC2. Wait, but how are the rings connected? The original SMILES has -c1cc(Nc3...) which is part of another ring. Maybe the core has three rings? No, Murcko scaffold is about the ring systems and the connecting bonds. Let me parse the input again. The input molecule has a central bicyclic system: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)-c1cc(...)n1CC2. The central part is the two benzene rings connected by a bridge (CC2). The other parts are substituents. So removing all substituents (OCH3, Cl, the amide group, and the N-linked chlorobenzene), the scaffold would be the bridged bicyclic system. The SMILES would be c1cc2c(cc1)c1ccccc1CC2. Wait, but the original structure might have a bridge between the two benzene rings via the CC2. Let me visualize: the first benzene ring (c1cc2c(cc1OC)), then connected to a second ring (c1cc(N...) with a CC2 bridge. So the core is the two benzene rings connected by the two-membered bridge (CC2). So after removing substituents, the SMILES would be c1ccc2c(c1)CCc1ccccc12. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the correct scaffold is the fused bicyclo structure. Alternatively, perhaps the scaffold is c1cc2c(cc1)Cc1ccccc1C2. Hmm, perhaps the correct SMILES is C1CC2=CC=C(C=C2C1)C3=CC=CC=C3. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try breaking down the input SMILES:\n\nOriginal: COc1cc2c(cc1OC)-c1cc(Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)nc(=O)n1CC2.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is COc1cc2c(cc1OC): This is a benzene ring (c1) with two methoxy groups (OC) at positions 1 and, perhaps, 4? Then connected to a second ring (c2) via a bridge.\n\nThe second part is -c1cc(Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)nc(=O)n1CC2: This seems to be a ring (possibly a five-membered ring with N and O?) connected to the CC2 bridge. The N is connected to another benzene ring (c3) with two Cl substituents.\n\nSo the main scaffold would be the two benzene rings (the first one and the second one connected via the CC2 bridge) and any other rings that are part of the core. The substituents like OCH3, Cl, and the amide group (nc(=O)) are removed. The connecting bonds between the rings (the bridge CC2) are kept.\n\nSo stripping all substituents, the scaffold is the two benzene rings connected by the bridge. The first benzene ring (c1cc2...) is connected via the bridge (CC2) to the other ring. The second ring in the bridge is a five-membered ring? Wait, the part after the bridge is -c1cc(...)n1CC2. The 'n1' suggests a nitrogen in the ring. But in the scaffold, we remove exocyclic groups but keep the ring atoms. Wait, the amide group (nc(=O)) is part of a ring? The ring would be a five-membered ring with the N and O? But since the Murcko scaffold keeps the ring systems, but removes substituents. So if the five-membered ring is part of the core, then it should stay. But perhaps in the input, the five-membered ring is part of the scaffold. Let me check again.\n\nThe input SMILES: The central part after the bridge is c1cc(Nc3...)nc(=O)n1. So the ring here is a five-membered ring: positions 1 (carbon), 2 (carbon), 3 (N connected to c3), 4 (carbon), 5 (carbon with nc(=O)). Wait, the actual ring closure is at n1, so the ring is: c1 (position 1), cc (positions 2 and 3), N (position 4?), nc(=O) (position 5?), and n1 (position 1 again). Wait, maybe it's a five-membered ring: c1 (1) connected to c (2), then c (3), then N (4), then c (5) (from c3?), but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the ring is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. The part 'nc(=O)n1' suggests that positions 1 and 5 are nitrogens. So the ring is n1 (N), c (position 2), c (position 3), N (position 4), and c(=O) (position 5), connected back to n1. But that's a five-membered ring. However, the Murcko scaffold requires keeping the ring systems. So if that five-membered ring is part of the core, then it stays. But the substituents on that ring, like the N connected to c3 (which is a benzene with Cl), would be removed.\n\nSo the scaffold would include the five-membered ring and the two benzene rings connected via the bridge. Wait, but the original structure might have multiple rings connected. The main scaffold is the union of all ring systems connected by the bridges. So the first benzene ring (c1cc2...), the bridge (CC2), the five-membered ring (n1...), and possibly another benzene ring connected via the bridge? Or is the five-membered ring part of the scaffold?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the five-membered ring is a side chain. But since it's a ring system connected via a bridge, it's part of the core. So the Murcko scaffold would include all ring systems connected by the bridges. So in this case, there are three rings: the first benzene, the bridge, the five-membered ring, and the other benzene via the N? Wait, no. The N is connected to another benzene (c3), which is a substituent. So that benzene (c3 with Cl) is a side chain and should be removed.\n\nSo the main scaffold is the first benzene ring connected via the bridge (CC2) to the five-membered ring. Then, the five-membered ring is part of the scaffold. But the five-membered ring has an exocyclic carbonyl group (C=O), which is a functional group. Wait, but the carbonyl is part of the ring? No, the ring is n1cc(N...)nc(=O)n1. Wait, the 'nc(=O)' is part of the ring? If the carbonyl is a substituent, then it should be removed. But if it's part of the ring, then it stays. But in a five-membered ring, the carbonyl would be a substituent unless it's part of a lactam structure. For example, in a ring like n1c(=O)ccc1, the carbonyl is part of the ring. But in this case, the structure is nc(=O)n1, which suggests that the carbonyl is a substituent on the ring nitrogen. Therefore, it should be removed as a functional group.\n\nSo the five-membered ring would be just the atoms in the ring without substituents. So the ring would be n1ccccn1, but I need to check the exact connectivity. The original ring is part of the SMILES: c1cc(Nc3...)nc(=O)n1. So the ring is c1 (C), c (C), N (connected to c3), c (C), nc(=O) (N with a carbonyl), and back to c1. So the ring is five members: C-C-N-C-N. Wait, that would make a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. But the carbonyl is attached to one of the nitrogens as a substituent. Therefore, the carbonyl is a functional group and should be removed. So the ring becomes n1ccc(N)cn1? No, wait, the original ring is c1cc(N...)nc(=O)n1. So positions 1 is carbon, 2 is carbon, 3 is N connected to c3, 4 is carbon, 5 is N with a carbonyl. So the ring is C-C-N-C-N. That's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. The carbonyl on the N is a substituent, so removing it leaves the ring as C-C-N-C-N. So the ring becomes n1c(C)ccn1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the ring atoms are C, C, N, C, N, connected in a cycle. So the SMILES for that ring without substituents would be C1=CNCCN1. But I'm not entirely certain.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use a tool to generate the scaffold, but since I have to do it manually, I'll proceed. The main rings are the benzene (from COc1cc2...), the bridge (CC2), and the five-membered ring (c1cc...n1). So the scaffold includes these rings connected via the bridges. All substituents like OCH3, Cl, and the carbonyl group are removed. The connecting bonds are retained. So the scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected via the bridge and the five-membered ring. Wait, no, the five-membered ring is connected to the bridge. Let me try to draw this:\n\nThe first benzene ring (c1) is connected to a bridge (CC2) which connects to the five-membered ring (c1...n1). The five-membered ring is part of the core. So the scaffold includes the benzene ring, the bridge, and the five-membered ring. But then, the five-membered ring's substituents (like the N connected to the chlorobenzene) are removed. So the final scaffold is the benzene ring connected via the bridge to the five-membered ring, with all substituents stripped.\n\nBut wait, the Murcko scaffold is supposed to include all ring systems and the connecting bonds. So any rings connected by bridges or linkers are part of the scaffold. In this case, the input molecule has a bicyclic system: the benzene ring connected via a bridge to another ring (which may be the five-membered ring). Additionally, there's another benzene ring attached via an amine group, which is a substituent.\n\nSo the main scaffold is the bicyclic system consisting of the benzene ring and the five-membered ring connected via the bridge. The other benzene rings attached via substituents (like the Cl-substituted benzene) are removed.\n\nTherefore, stripping all substituents, the scaffold would be the bicyclic system: benzene ring (c1cc2c(cc1)) connected via a bridge (CC2) to the five-membered ring (c1ccncn1). But wait, the five-membered ring in the original SMILES is c1cc(N...)nc(=O)n1. After removing substituents, it becomes c1cccnn1. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the five-membered ring becomes a pyrrole-like ring without substituents. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the five-membered ring might not be aromatic after removal of substituents. This is getting tricky without visualizing the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to remove all atoms that are not part of any ring system or connecting bonds. The Murcko scaffold is generated by iteratively removing terminal non-ring atoms and converting linker atoms to single bonds. So, the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify all ring systems.\n2. Identify the linkers (chains connecting two rings).\n3. Retain the rings and linkers, removing all other substituents.\n\nIn this case, the molecule has a complex structure. The main rings might include a benzene ring connected via a bridge (CC2) to a five-membered ring (which is part of another ring system). The linker here is the CC2 bridge. The five-membered ring is connected to another benzene via an amine group, which is a substituent. So that benzene is a side chain and is removed. The methoxy groups on the benzene are substituents and are removed. The carbonyl group on the five-membered ring is a substituent and is removed.\n\nThus, the scaffold would consist of the benzene ring, the bridge (CC2), and the five-membered ring (now without substituents). The five-membered ring's structure would change to just the ring atoms. So the SMILES would be c1cc2c(cc1)Cc1ncccc1CC2. Wait, but how to represent the five-membered ring correctly? If the original five-membered ring is c1cc(N...)nc(=O)n1, removing substituents would leave c1cccnn1. But ensuring the correct connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the five-membered ring becomes c1cncn1. But I'm not certain. This part is challenging without drawing it out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct Murcko scaffold is the two benzene rings connected by the bridge, and the five-membered ring is considered a substituent and removed. But that doesn't seem right because the five-membered ring is part of the core connected via the bridge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the scaffold is the benzene ring connected via the bridge to another benzene ring. But in the original SMILES, the bridge connects to a five-membered ring, not a benzene. So that might not be the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the original SMILES:\n\nCOc1cc2c(cc1OC)-c1cc(Nc3c(Cl)cccc3Cl)nc(=O)n1CC2.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- The first part is COc1cc2c(cc1OC): a benzene ring (c1) with two methoxy groups (OCH3) at positions 1 and 4 (since cc1OC suggests that after the first c, the next is c connected to OC). Then, this benzene is connected to a bridge (CC2) via position 2 (since cc2c...).\n\n- The bridge is CC2, which connects to another ring: -c1cc(Nc3...)nc(=O)n1. This is a five-membered ring (positions 1-5: c1, c, c, N, nc(=O), n1). The N in this ring is connected to another benzene ring (c3 with Cl substituents), which is a substituent.\n\nSo the core scaffold includes the first benzene ring, the bridge (CC2), and the five-membered ring. The substituents (OCH3, Cl, the amide group (C=O), and the N-linked benzene are all removed.\n\nSo the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via CC2 to the five-membered ring, which after removing substituents becomes a ring of C and N atoms. The five-membered ring, after removing the carbonyl and the N-substituent, would have two nitrogens. So the ring is c1cc[nH]cn1 (but without hydrogens). However, in SMILES notation, explicit hydrogens are not usually shown. So the SMILES for the five-membered ring would be c1cnccn1 or similar. But I need to ensure the correct connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, the five-membered ring after removal of substituents is c1ccncn1. Let's see: original ring is c1cc(Nc3...)nc(=O)n1. Removing the Nc3... substituent and the carbonyl, we're left with c1ccncn1. So the ring is five members: C-C-C-N-C-N. But that's six atoms. Wait, no: the original ring is c1 (C), c (C), c (connected to N), N (connected to c3), nc(=O) (N with carbonyl), and back to c1. So the ring has five atoms: C1, C2, C3, N4, N5, connected in a cycle. So the SMILES would be C1=CCN=N1. But I'm not sure about the exact bonding.\n\nThis is quite complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct scaffold is the benzene ring connected via the bridge to the five-membered ring, with all substituents removed. The SMILES would then be c1cc2c(cc1)Cc1ccncn1CC2. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the five-membered ring may not be part of the scaffold if it's considered a functional group, but according to the definition, rings are retained. So the final answer's SMILES would be:\n\n{\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1cc2c(cc1)c1cccnc1CC2\"}\n\nBut I need to verify. Alternatively, the five-membered ring becomes a benzene ring? No, the original is a five-membered ring. Hmm. I think the correct scaffold includes the two benzene rings connected by the bridge. Wait, no\u2014the original bridge connects a benzene to a five-membered ring. So the scaffold includes the benzene and the five-membered ring connected via the bridge. Therefore, the SMILES would be c1cc2c(cc1)Cc1cccnc1CC2. But I'm not entirely sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with this.",

The input SMILES is CC12CCN(C(=O)C3CCC(C(=O)O)CC3)C(Cc3c(O)cccc31)C2(C)C.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the ring systems and the connecting bonds. The Murcko scaffold requires retaining only the rings and the linkers between them, removing all side chains and substituents.\n\nLooking at the structure, I see a bicyclic system. The main part starts with CC12CCN... which suggests two fused rings. The nitrogen in CCN might be part of a ring. Then there's a carbonyl group attached (C(=O)) leading to another cyclohexane-like ring (C3CCC...CC3). But that cyclohexane ring has substituents: a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group. Those are functional groups, so they should be removed.\n\nNext, there's a branch with C(Cc3c(O)cccc31). The c3c... part is a benzene ring with an oxygen substituent. The hydroxyl (O) here is a functional group, so we remove that, leaving the benzene ring. The ethyl group (Cc) attached to the main structure is a side chain, so that gets trimmed off.\n\nThe C2(C)C at the end is a substituent on the second ring; the (C)C is a tert-butyl group, which is a side chain. Removing that leaves just the fused ring system.\n\nPutting it all together: the main scaffold should be the two fused rings (the bicyclo system) connected to the benzene ring via a single bond. The connecting bonds between the rings are kept, but all substituents like hydroxyl, carbonyl, and tert-butyl groups are stripped away.\n\nSo, the rings are the bicyclo[4.2.0]octane part and the benzene. The connecting bonds are the ones between the bicyclo system and the benzene. The final Murcko scaffold would be the fused bicyclic system attached to the benzene ring without any substituents. Converting that to SMILES might look like C1C2CCNCC1C2c1ccccc1, but I need to check the exact connectivity.\n\nWait, let me draw it mentally. The original structure has a bridged system: the CC12CCN...C2(C)C part forms a bridged bicyclic structure. The benzene ring is connected via a single bond from the bridged system. So the Murcko scaffold includes the bridged rings and the benzene connected by the single bond. All substituents like the carbonyl groups and hydroxyls are removed. So the SMILES would be C1CC2(CCN1)CC(C2)c1ccccc1. Let me verify the connectivity. The bridged system is C1-C-C2-C-C-N connected back to C1, and the C2 is connected to another C which links to the benzene. Yes, that seems right. So the final SMILES is the bridged rings plus benzene connected without any substituents.",

The substituents are the CC(C) group attached to the nitrogen at position 1 and the NCc3ccccc3 group attached to the carbon in position 2. According to the Murcko definition, I need to remove these side chains. The CC(C) is a branch off the nitrogen, so that gets removed. The NCc3ccccc3 is a side chain with a benzene ring; the benzene is part of a substituent here, so the entire NCc3ccccc3 should be trimmed. What's left is the core bicyclic system: n1cnc2ncnc21. Wait, but connecting bonds between rings are kept. The original structure has the two rings connected via the shared atoms. So the scaffold should be the fused rings without any substituents.

The input SMILES is CCc1ncnc(-c2ccc(C(=O)N3CCN(CCN)CC3)c(Cl)c2)c1C#Cc1ccc(N)nc1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definition of a Murcko scaffold. It's the core structure consisting of ring systems and the connecting bonds between them, with all side chains and functional groups removed. So, I need to identify the rings and the bonds that link them, stripping away any substituents.\n\nLooking at the SMILES string, let's break it down. The main structure seems to have multiple rings connected. The central part is probably a bicyclic system. Let's parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nStarting from the left: CCc1ncnc(...)c1C#Cc1ccc(N)nc1. The 'c1ncnc' suggests a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, maybe a pyrimidine-like ring. The substituents attached to this ring are a propyl group (CCc...), a group connected via a bond (the -c2ccc... part), and a ethynyl group (C#C) leading to another ring.\n\nThe ethynyl (C#C) connects to another ring: c1ccc(N)nc1. This looks like another six-membered ring, possibly a pyridine or similar, with an amino group (N) attached. But since functional groups are removed, the amino (N) should be stripped.\n\nNow, the part in the middle: -c2ccc(C(=O)N3CCN(CCN)CC3)c(Cl)c2. This is a benzene ring (c2ccc...) with substituents: a carbonyl group connected to a piperazine-like ring (C(=O)N3CCN(CCN)CC3) and a chlorine (Cl). The Murcko scaffold should remove these, so the benzene ring here might be part of the scaffold if it's connected via a bond to the central ring.\n\nPutting it all together: The central pyrimidine-like ring (from c1ncnc) is connected via the ethynyl (C#C) to the other aromatic ring (c1ccc...nc1). However, the ethynyl is a connecting bond, so it should be kept. The benzene ring from the -c2ccc... part is attached to the central ring via a single bond (the -c2... part), so that benzene is part of the scaffold. Wait, but the connecting bond is the one between the central ring and the benzene. So the central ring (pyrimidine), the benzene (from -c2...), and the other ring connected via ethynyl. But wait, how are they connected?\n\nThe central ring (c1ncnc) has substituents: the propyl (CCc), the benzene (from -c2...), and the ethynyl. The propyl is a side chain, so remove. The benzene via -c2... is connected via a single bond, so that benzene is part of the scaffold? Or is that substituent a side chain? Wait, Murcko scaffolds include all ring systems and the connecting bonds. So if two rings are connected by a bond (like a single bond), that's part of the scaffold. But substituents on the rings, like Cl, O-containing groups, etc., are removed.\n\nSo, in the benzene ring (c2ccc(C(=O)...)c(Cl)c2), the substituents C(=O)... and Cl should be removed. The benzene ring itself remains if it's part of the core connected to other rings.\n\nSo the core would be the central pyrimidine ring connected via a bond to the benzene ring (but only if that benzene is part of the main structure). Wait, the central pyrimidine has a substituent that's another benzene (from -c2...), but the connecting bond is part of the scaffold. So the scaffold would include the central pyrimidine, the benzene ring attached to it (via the single bond), and the ethynyl-connected ring.\n\nWait, the ethynyl (C#C) is a connecting bond between two rings. The central pyrimidine (ring 1) is connected via ethynyl to another ring (ring 3). Then the benzene (ring 2) is connected to ring 1. So all three rings are part of the scaffold? Or only the ones connected through the linking bonds.\n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold is the union of all ring systems and the bonds that connect them. So any ring that is part of the core structure connected via bonds (not via side chains) is included.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Remove all substituents (side chains, functional groups) from the rings.\n\n2. Retain all ring atoms and the bonds that connect different rings.\n\nSo, in the input SMILES, the central ring (c1ncnc...) has three substituents: propyl (CCc), benzene (via -c2...), and ethynyl (C#C...). The propyl is a side chain, so remove. The benzene via -c2... is connected via a single bond; that benzene is part of the scaffold as it's a ring connected via a bond. The ethynyl connects to another ring (c1ccc(N)nc1), so that's another ring connected via the triple bond (C#C is the linker), which is part of the scaffold.\n\nBut wait, the ethynyl is a triple bond connecting two rings. So the rings connected via the triple bond are both part of the scaffold. Similarly, the benzene (ring 2) is connected via a single bond to the central ring (ring 1). So the scaffold would be three rings: ring1 (pyrimidine), ring2 (benzene), connected via single bond, and ring3 (pyridine-like) connected via triple bond (C#C) to ring1.\n\nBut wait, the benzene (ring2) is attached to the central ring. So the scaffold would be ring1 connected to ring2 and ring3 via bonds. Then, we need to retain all rings and the connecting bonds.\n\nSo, after removing substituents:\n\n- The central pyrimidine ring (c1ncnc...) becomes a six-membered ring with two nitrogens, connected to benzene (ring2) and via ethynyl to ring3.\n\nBut the substituents on the benzene (ring2) like Cl and the carbonyl group connected to the piperazine are removed. Similarly, the amino group (N) on ring3 is removed.\n\nSo the scaffold would be:\n\nring1 (pyrimidine: c1ncnc(c2ccccc2)c1) connected via C#C to ring3 (c1ccc[n]c1), but wait, the original ring3 is c1ccc(N)nc1. Removing the NH2 group (N), it becomes c1cccnc1, which is a pyridine ring. But wait, the nitrogen is part of the ring. So the ring3 is a pyridine ring (six-membered, with one nitrogen). So the scaffold would have three rings: the central pyrimidine connected to a benzene (ring2) and via ethynyl to a pyridine (ring3). Wait, but the benzene (ring2) is connected via a single bond to the central ring. So the Murcko scaffold would have all these rings and the connecting bonds.\n\nWait, but in the original SMILES, the benzene (ring2) is connected as a substituent to the central ring. So the structure is: central ring (pyrimidine) with substituents: benzene (ring2) and ethynyl-linked pyridine (ring3). So the scaffold is the combination of these three rings connected via the bonds between them.\n\nBut I need to make sure that all exocyclic groups are removed. So any substituents on the rings, like Cl, NH2, etc., are stripped.\n\nSo the final scaffold SMILES would be the central pyrimidine (c1ncnc2ccccc2c1) connected via ethynyl (C#C) to the pyridine (c1ccc[n]c1), and also connected to the benzene (c2ccccc2). Wait, but how is the benzene connected? The original structure has the central ring (c1ncnc(-c2ccc(...)c2)c1...). The -c2 part means the benzene is attached via a single bond to the central ring. So in the scaffold, that becomes a bond between the two rings. So the SMILES for that part would be c1ncnc(c2ccccc2)c1... So the entire scaffold would be c1ncnc(c2ccccc2)c1C#Cc3ccc[n]c3.\n\nWait, but the ethynyl is part of the connecting bond. So the central ring (c1ncnc...) has a substituent C#C connected to the pyridine ring (c3ccc[n]c3). So the connecting bonds are the single bond to the benzene and the triple bond to the pyridine.\n\nPutting it all together, the Murcko scaffold SMILES would be c1c(nc(nc1c2ccccc2)C#Cc3ccc[n]c3. Wait, need to check the actual connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, let's build it step by step. The central ring is a pyrimidine (six-membered, two nitrogens). The benzene (c2ccccc2) is attached at position 4 (assuming the pyrimidine is numbered such that the substituents are at positions 4 and 5). Then, the ethynyl (C#C) connects to another pyridine ring (c3ccc[n]c3). So the SMILES would be c1nc(nc(c1c2ccccc2)C#Cc3ccc[n]c3)N. Wait, no, the central ring has to be properly closed.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cnc(nc1c2ccccc2)C#Cc3cccnc3. Let me parse that:\n\n- c1cnc(nc1...): this is a pyrimidine-like ring (positions 1,3,5 have nitrogens?), but SMILES notation can vary. Alternatively, perhaps it's c1ncnc(c1...) which would be a six-membered ring with two nitrogens.\n\nWait, the original SMILES starts with CCc1ncnc(...)c1C#C... So the central ring is 'c1ncnc(...)c1', which is a five-membered ring? Wait, no. 'c1ncnc(...)c1' would be a five-membered ring: positions 1 (carbon), 2 (n), 3 (c), 4 (n), 5 (c), then back to 1? No, that's five members. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, SMILES rings are defined by the closure numbers. For example, c1ncnc(...)c1 would be a five-membered ring: atom 1 is carbon (c1), then n (atom 2), c (atom3), n (atom4), c (atom5), then back to atom1 via the closure. Wait, that's five members. But that's not possible because in SMILES, each closure number must correspond to two atoms. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing.\n\nWait, the original SMILES is CCc1ncnc(-c2ccc(...)c2)c1C#Cc1ccc(N)nc1. Let's parse the central ring:\n\nThe part 'c1ncnc(...)c1' is a ring closure. The 'c1' starts at the first carbon, then n (atom2), c (atom3), n (atom4), c (atom5), then the 'c1' at the end closes the ring back to atom1. Wait, that's a five-membered ring? But that would have 5 atoms: C, N, C, N, C. That seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps it's a six-membered ring but I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, maybe the 'c1ncnc(...)c1' is a six-membered ring. Let's see: atom1 (c1), atom2 (n), atom3 (c), atom4 (n), atom5 (c), then the closure back to atom1. That's five atoms. So that can't be. Hmm, perhaps there's a typo, but the original SMILES is as given. Alternatively, maybe the central ring is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. But that's possible, like an imidazole or similar.\n\nWait, but in any case, the key is to identify the rings and their connections. The central ring (whatever its structure) is connected to a benzene ring (from the -c2ccc part) and via the ethynyl to another ring (c1ccc(N)nc1). The substituents like Cl, C(=O)..., and the amino group should be removed.\n\nSo the Murcko scaffold would consist of the central ring, the benzene ring connected to it, and the other ring connected via the ethynyl, with all substituents stripped.\n\nPutting that into SMILES, the central ring (say, five-membered) connected to benzene and ethynyl-linked ring. The benzene would be written as c2ccccc2, the ethynyl as C#C, and the other ring as c3ccc[n]c3 (since the amino group is removed).\n\nSo combining all, the scaffold SMILES would be c1ncnc(c2ccccc2)c1C#Cc3ccc[n]c3. But need to ensure the ring closures are correctly numbered and don't have overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, the actual structure may require different numbering. For example, the central ring could be a six-membered ring with two nitrogens, like pyrimidine, but the original SMILES parsing suggests a five-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake, but regardless, the exact structure isn't necessary as long as the scaffold is correctly derived by removing substituents.\n\nIn any case, the correct approach is to remove all substituents (like Cl, amino, propyl, the piperazine group, etc.) and retain the rings and connecting bonds. So the final SMILES should have the central ring, the attached benzene, and the ethynyl-linked pyridine, with all substituents removed.",

Let me start by recalling that the Murcko scaffold involves retaining only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. All side chains and functional groups attached to the rings should be removed.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the SMILES to visualize the structure. The molecule has a central benzene ring (c1cc...cc1) with substituents. There are two methoxy groups (OCH3) attached to the benzene ring (COc...OC). Then, there's a ring system connected via a nitrogen. The part with N3CCN...CC3 suggests a piperazine or similar ring. The substituents on the nitrogen include a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a fluorine-containing chain (C(F)=Cc4ccccc4), which is a benzene ring.\n\nThe Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains. So, the methoxy groups (OCH3) on the benzene are side chains and should be removed. The piperazine ring (N3CCN...CC3) is part of the ring system, but any substituents attached to it, like the C(=O) group and the attached fluorine and benzene, need to be stripped. The nitrogen atoms in the rings are part of the core structure, so they stay. The amide group (C(=O)) and the fluorine substituent (F) are functional groups and should be removed. Similarly, the benzene ring (c4ccccc4) attached via the C=O is a side chain and should be eliminated. \n\nSo, starting with the central benzene ring (c1cc2...c2cc1), the adjacent rings are the piperazine (N3CCNCC3) and another nitrogen-containing ring (maybe a pyrimidine or similar from the nc(N)c part). Wait, looking again, the original structure has \"nc(N3CCN(...)CC3)nc(N)c2\". The 'nc' parts are part of a ring system. Let me make sure. The 'c2nc(...)nc(N)c2' suggests a fused ring, perhaps a bicyclic system where the benzene is fused to another ring, like a pyrimidine or similar. The N3 ring is a piperazine connected to this. So, the core would be the fused benzene and the adjacent nitrogen-containing rings, with the connecting bonds between them. All substituents like OCH3, the amide, fluorine, and the benzene ring attached to the amide are side chains and need to be removed.\n\nSo stripping all that, the scaffold would be the fused benzene ring connected to the piperazine (but wait, piperazine is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. However, in the SMILES, the part N3CCN(...)CC3: the atoms in the ring are N3, C, C, N, C, C, making a six-membered ring. So that's a piperazine ring. But is that part of the scaffold? The Murcko scaffold includes all ring systems and the connecting bonds. The central benzene is fused to another ring (from the 'cc2nc...c2cc1' part), which might be a pyrimidine or similar. Then the piperazine ring is connected via a single bond? Or is it part of a fused system?\n\nWait, the original SMILES is COc1cc2nc(N3CCN(...)CC3)nc(N)c2cc1OC. Let me break it down. The central benzene (c1) has positions where at position 'cc2', there's a fused ring. The 'nc(N3...)nc(N)c2' part: so the 'c2' is part of the benzene (c1cc2...c2cc1). The 'nc(...)nc(N)c2' suggests a ring where the 'n' atoms are connected. Let me try to draw this mentally. The benzene ring (c1) is connected to a second ring (possibly a five-membered ring with two nitrogens). Then, the N3 is part of a piperazine ring connected to this second ring. The connecting bonds between the rings are part of the scaffold. However, any substituents on the rings (like the OCH3, the amide group, etc.) are removed.\n\nSo, the scaffold should include the benzene ring fused to the five-membered ring (which has two nitrogens), and the piperazine ring connected to it via a single bond (if that's part of the connecting structure). Wait, no, the Murcko scaffold includes all rings and the bonds that connect them. So if the piperazine is connected via a single bond to the fused ring system, then that single bond is part of the scaffold. But in this case, the piperazine (N3CCN...CC3) is attached via a nitrogen to the fused ring. Wait, the SMILES has 'nc(N3CCN(...)CC3)'. So the nitrogen in the 'nc(...)' part is part of the fused ring, and it's connected to the N3 of the piperazine. So that's a single bond connecting the fused ring system to the piperazine ring. Therefore, in the scaffold, both the fused ring (benzene plus another ring) and the piperazine are kept, connected by that single bond. The substituents on the piperazine (like the amide group) are removed.\n\nAdditionally, the 'nc(N)c2' part: the 'N' here is a substituent (NH2?), which would be a functional group and should be removed. So the final scaffold would have the benzene fused to a ring with two nitrogens (like a pyrimidine), connected via a single bond to the piperazine ring. The methoxy groups on the benzene are removed, as well as any substituents on the nitrogen atoms in the rings.\n\nPutting this all together, the scaffold SMILES would be the fused benzene-pyrimidine (or similar) system connected to the piperazine. Let's reconstruct this. The original benzene is c1cc2...c2cc1. The 'nc(...)nc(...)c2' forms a fused ring. So the fused part would be c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)nc[c2cc1]. Wait, but without the substituents. So the N3CCNCC3 is the piperazine ring. But in the original, the piperazine has substituents (C(=O)...), which are removed. So the scaffold would be the fused benzene ring with the two nitrogens in the fused ring, connected via a single bond to the piperazine. The NH2 group on the fused ring's nitrogen is removed.\n\nSo the SMILES would be c1cc2nc(n3ccncc3)nc(c2cc1). Wait, but let's check. The original has 'nc(N3CCN(...)CC3)nc(N)c2'. After removing substituents, the 'N3CCN(...)CC3' becomes 'N3CCNCC3' (piperazine), and the 'nc(N)c2' becomes 'ncc2'. Wait, no. The 'nc(N)c2' would have the NH2 group removed, so it's just 'ncc2'. Similarly, the piperazine is connected via the N3, which is part of the fused ring. So the fused ring is benzene (c1) fused to a ring with two nitrogens: c1cc2nc(n3ccncc3)nc c2cc1. Let me write that as c1cc2nc(n3ccncc3)ncc2cc1. That would be the Murcko scaffold. Let me check if that's correct. The benzene is fused to a five-membered ring (since the 'nc...nc' part would form a five-membered ring?), or maybe a six-membered ring. Wait, perhaps the fused ring is a pyrimidine: benzene fused to a pyrimidine ring. The SMILES would then be something like c1c(c2ncnc2)cc... but I might need to adjust. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cc2nc(n3ccncc3)nc(c2cc1). Let me validate this. The central benzene (c1) has a fused ring (c2), which is a pyrimidine-like ring with two nitrogens. Then connected to that is the piperazine ring (n3ccncc3). The connecting bond is between the nitrogen in the fused ring and the piperazine's nitrogen. So the final scaffold SMILES would be c1cc2nc(n3ccncc3)ncc2cc1. Wait, but the piperazine in SMILES is N1CCNCC1, so in this case, the piperazine is written as N3CCNCC3. So in the scaffold, it's connected as nc(N3CCNCC3)nc..., but without the substituents. So the SMILES becomes c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)nc c2cc1. But in the original input, the N3 is part of the connection: nc(N3CCN(...)CC3). So after removing substituents, that part becomes nc(N3CCNCC3). Therefore, the scaffold is c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)ncc2cc1. But wait, the 'nc(N3CCNCC3)' would mean the nitrogen in the fused ring is connected to the piperazine's N3. So the SMILES would be c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)nc c2cc1. However, when writing SMILES, the numbers should be ordered correctly. Let me make sure. The benzene is c1, the fused ring is c2. The 'nc(N3CCNCC3)' is part of the fused ring. So the correct SMILES would be c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)nc(c2cc1). But wait, the 'nc' part: the 'n' is part of the fused ring. So perhaps the correct scaffold is c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)nc(c2cc1). Let me check if that makes sense. The benzene ring (c1) is fused to a ring that has two nitrogens. The first 'nc' is part of the fused ring, and the N3 is connected to the piperazine (N3CCNCC3). The other 'nc' part would be another nitrogen in the fused ring. However, the original structure also has a 'nc(N)c2' part. Removing the NH2 group (the 'N' in 'nc(N)'), it becomes 'ncc2'. So the fused ring would be 'c2ncnc(N3CCNCC3)c2'. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to write the SMILES step by step.\n\nOriginal SMILES: COc1cc2nc(N3CCN(C(=O)C(F)=Cc4ccccc4)CC3)nc(N)c2cc1OC.\n\nStripping substituents:\n\n- Remove the methoxy groups (COc1...OC becomes c1...c1).\n- The 'nc(N3CCN(...)CC3)' becomes 'nc(N3CCNCC3)' since the substituent on the N3 (the C(=O)...) is removed.\n- The 'nc(N)' becomes 'nc' (removing the NH2 group).\n\nSo the scaffold SMILES would be c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)ncc2cc1. Let me check the ring closures. The benzene is c1, connected to c2. The c2 is part of a ring where there's 'nc(N3CCNCC3)nc'. So the fused ring would be c2 connected to n, then to c, then to N3, etc. Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)nc(c2)cc1. Or maybe c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)ncc2cc1. Let me think about the ring numbering. The benzene is c1. The 'cc2' means the second carbon is connected to c2. Then c2 is part of another ring. The 'nc(N3...)' and 'nc(...)c2' would form a fused ring. For example, the fused ring could be c2ncnc(N3...)c2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fused ring might be a five-membered ring: c2ncnc(N3...)c2. However, that would make a five-membered ring. But perhaps the original structure has a six-membered fused ring. Maybe it's a pyrimidine fused to benzene. In any case, the key is that the scaffold includes all rings and connecting bonds. So the final SMILES should be c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)ncc2cc1. Let me validate this. The benzene (c1cc...cc1) is fused to a ring that includes the 'nc(...)nc' part. The 'N3CCNCC3' is the piperazine ring connected via a single bond. This seems correct. So the output scaffold would be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1cc2nc(N3CCNCC3)ncc2cc1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is Nc1c(C(=O)c2cccc(C(O)CO)c2)cnn1-c1ccc(F)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the ring systems. The molecule has two aromatic rings. The left part starts with Nc1c... which forms a ring with the atoms connected by the numbers. Then there's a bridge to another benzene ring via the -c1ccc(F)cc1 part. Wait, maybe the left ring is a bicyclic system?\n\nLooking closer, the core structure has a central ring. The left side has a nitrogen in the ring, so maybe a pyrazole or similar? The SMILES breaks down as N attached to a carbon (c1), then another carbon connected to a carbonyl (C(=O)), which links to a benzene ring (c2cccc(C(O)CO)c2). Then there's a cnn1, suggesting a triazole or another N-containing ring? Then connected via a single bond to the benzene ring with fluorine (-c1ccc(F)cc1).\n\nWait, the main rings are the triazole (or similar) ring on the left (Nc1c...cnn1) connected to a benzene ring (the part after the hyphen). The other ring is the one attached via the carbonyl group. But the Murcko scaffold requires removing side chains and exocyclic groups. So the carbonyl (C=O) is a functional group and should be removed. Similarly, the C(O)CO attached to the benzene ring is a side chain. The fluorine on the benzene ring is an exocyclic substituent, so that gets removed too.\n\nSo, stripping away all those groups: the central rings are the triazole (or whatever the N-containing ring is) fused or connected to the benzene ring via a single bond. Wait, the original SMILES connects the triazole part (nn1) to the benzene (c1ccc...), so the scaffold would be the triazole ring connected directly to the benzene ring via a single bond, with all substituents removed. Also, the other benzene ring attached via the carbonyl would be a side chain, so that benzene might not be part of the scaffold. Wait, no\u2014the carbonyl is part of a substituent on the triazole ring. So removing the carbonyl and the attached benzene (since that's a side chain) would leave the triazole ring connected to the benzene (with fluorine, which is also a substituent, so removed). Wait, the main rings are the triazole and the benzene connected via a single bond. But the fluorine is on the benzene, so removing that. Also, the other substituents like the carbonyl group and the C(O)CO would be side chains. So the Murcko scaffold would be the triazole ring connected to the benzene ring, both without any substituents. Let me reconstruct: the triazole (Nc1c...cnn1) connected to benzene (c1ccc...), but without the fluorine, carbonyl, and other groups. So the scaffold would be the triazole linked to benzene via a single bond. But how exactly? Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nOriginal: Nc1c(C(=O)c2cccc(C(O)CO)c2)cnn1-c1ccc(F)cc1\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is Nc1c(...)cnn1: this forms a ring. The 'c1' starts a ring, with N attached. Then another carbon connected to a carbonyl group (C(=O)) which is attached to a benzene ring (c2cccc...). Then the 'cnn1' closes the first ring. So the first ring is a 5-membered ring with two nitrogens? Let's see: positions 1 (N), 2 (C), 3 (C connected to carbonyl), 4 (C), 5 (N), and back to 1? Wait, SMILES notation: Nc1c(...)cnn1. The indices go as follows: atom 1 is the first carbon after N. Then the next carbon (atom 2) has the substituent (C(=O)...). Then comes another carbon (atom 3), followed by two nitrogens (nn) connecting back to atom 1. So the ring is N-C-C-C-N-N? That would be a 5-membered ring? Wait, no: the indices would be 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (C), then two Ns (positions 4 and 5?), but perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring? Let me draw it mentally. The SMILES is Nc1c(...)cnn1. So starting with N connected to C1. Then C1 is connected to another C (atom 2), which has substituents. Then atom 3 is another C, followed by two Ns (atom 4 and 5?), and back to C1. Wait, maybe it's a five-membered ring: N-C1-C2-C3-N-N-C1? That would make a ring of five atoms? No, that's six. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is a triazole. Triazoles have three Ns, but here maybe two. Alternatively, maybe it's a pyrimidine ring? Not sure. Regardless, the key point is that the core rings are the ones left after removing substituents.\n\nSo the main rings are:\n\n1. The ring formed by Nc1c...cnn1. Let's say it's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens (like imidazole but with an extra N? Or a triazole? Maybe a 1,2,3-triazole? The sequence is N-c-c-c-n-n, which would make positions 1 (N), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (N), 5 (N), but that's not possible. Wait, the SMILES is Nc1c(...)cnn1. So the ring starts with C1 connected to N. Then C1 is connected to C2 (next atom), which has a substituent. Then C3, then N4, N5, and back to C1. So the ring is C1-C2-C3-N4-N5-C1? That's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens (N4 and N5). So it's a 1,2,4-triazole? Wait, maybe not. Let's think: the ring would be C1 connected to N, then C2, C3, N4, N5, and back to C1. That's five atoms in the ring: C1, C2, C3, N4, N5. So a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. So maybe that's a pyrazole ring with an extra N? Not sure, but the exact type might not matter for scaffold extraction.\n\nThe other ring is the benzene ring connected via the hyphen: -c1ccc(F)cc1. So that's a benzene ring with a fluorine substituent. The hyphen indicates a single bond connecting the previous part (the triazole-like ring) to this benzene.\n\nSo, the Murcko scaffold should retain these two rings (the triazole-like and the benzene) connected by the single bond, but remove all substituents. The substituents here are:\n\n- On the triazole ring: the C(=O) group attached to C2, which is part of a benzene ring (so that entire branch is a side chain).\n- On the benzene ring attached via C(=O): the C(O)CO group is another substituent.\n- On the benzene ring at the end (-c1ccc(F)cc1), the fluorine is a substituent.\n\nSo stripping all those, the scaffold would be the triazole-like ring connected via a single bond to the benzene ring, with no substituents. So the SMILES would be Nc1ccc2cnn1-c2cccc3. Wait, no. Let me reconstruct.\n\nThe triazole-like ring after removing substituents would be Nc1c([nothing])cnn1. Wait, but the original structure is Nc1c(C(=O)c2cccc...)cnn1. So if we remove the C(=O) and its attached benzene (which is a side chain), then that C atom in the ring (C2) would have no substituents. So the triazole-like ring becomes Nc1cccnn1. But perhaps the correct SMILES for the scaffold would be the rings connected by the bond. The original connection is between the triazole ring (nn1) and the benzene (c1ccc...). So after removing the fluorine and the other substituents, the scaffold would be Nc1cccnn1-c1ccccc1. Wait, but the benzene is written as c1ccc(F)cc1 in the original, so after removing F, it's c1ccccc1. But the connection is via the hyphen: -c1ccc(F)cc1. So the connecting bond is between the triazole's nitrogen (maybe?) and the benzene's carbon.\n\nWait, the original SMILES is Nc1c(...)cnn1-c1ccc(F)cc1. The part after the hyphen is a benzene ring connected via a single bond to the previous part. So the connecting point is between the n1 (from the triazole-like ring) and the c of the benzene. Wait, no: the SMILES structure is Nc1c(...)cnn1-c1ccc(F)cc1. The 'nn1' indicates that the two nitrogens are connected to atom 1 (the first carbon in the ring). Then the hyphen '-' is a single bond connecting the previous atom (which is the last nitrogen in 'nn1') to the benzene ring's first carbon. So the scaffold would have the triazole-like ring connected via a single bond to the benzene ring.\n\nSo stripping all substituents, the SMILES would be Nc1cccnn1c2ccccc2. Wait, but how to represent the connection. Let's build it step by step.\n\nTriazole-like ring (without substituents): Nc1cccnn1. Then connected to benzene: the connecting point is from the nitrogen (the last 'n' in 'nn1') to the benzene's carbon. So maybe Nc1cccnn1-c1ccccc1. But SMILES notation requires proper ring closures. Alternatively, the benzene would be c1ccccc1 and connected via a bond to the triazole's nitrogen. So the full scaffold SMILES would be Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. But since they are connected by a single bond, perhaps the correct SMILES is Nc1ccc(nn1)c2ccccc2. Wait, no, because the original connection is from the triazole's nitrogen to the benzene's carbon. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal SMILES after the triazole part: ...nn1-c1ccc(F)cc1. The 'nn1' closes the triazole ring (atom 1 is the first carbon after N). Then '-c1ccc(F)cc1' is a benzene ring connected via a single bond to the last nitrogen in 'nn1'. So in the scaffold, after removing F, the benzene is c1ccccc1, and connected to the triazole's nitrogen. So the scaffold SMILES would be Nc1c(C)cnn1c2ccccc2, but without the C substituent. Wait, the triazole ring's structure after removing the substituent (C(=O)...) would have the carbon (originally attached to C(=O)) as just a CH group. So the SMILES for the triazole ring becomes Nc1c(C)cnn1, but since the C here is part of the ring, it's just part of the scaffold. Wait, no: in the original SMILES, the triazole ring is Nc1c(C(=O)c2...)cnn1. The C(=O) is a substituent on the ring's carbon (atom 2). So removing that substituent leaves just a CH2? Or a CH? Wait, in the ring, each carbon is part of the ring structure. So the original ring is N-C1-C2-C3-N-N-C1. The C2 has a substituent (C(=O)...), which is removed. So the scaffold's C2 is just a CH (if the original was C with a substituent). So the triazole ring becomes Nc1c(C)cnn1, but the exact hydrogen count depends on valence. Alternatively, perhaps the SMILES for the scaffold would be Nc1cccnn1 connected to benzene. Wait, maybe the correct scaffold is the triazole ring (Nc1cccnn1) connected via a single bond to benzene (c1ccccc1), giving Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. But SMILES requires proper numbering. Let me try writing it correctly.\n\nThe triazole ring: Starting with N attached to C1. Then C1 connected to C2 (which in the original has the substituent, now removed). Then C3 (connected to C2), then N4 connected to N5, which connects back to C1. So the ring is N-C1-C2-C3-N4-N5-C1. That's a five-membered ring? Wait, N5 connecting back to C1 would make the ring N-C1-C2-C3-N4-N5-C1? That's a six-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, maybe the triazole ring is a five-membered ring with three nitrogens. For example, 1,2,3-triazole: N1C=CN=N1. But I'm not sure. This is getting complicated. Maybe the exact structure isn't necessary as long as the scaffold is correctly extracted by removing substituents.\n\nIn any case, the key is to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. The main rings are the triazole-like ring connected to the benzene. The other benzene attached via the carbonyl is a side chain and should be removed. The fluorine on the benzene is a substituent and removed. The C(O)CO is also a side chain. So the final scaffold is the triazole ring connected to the benzene via a single bond. The SMILES would be Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. But I need to ensure proper ring closures and correct SMILES syntax.\n\nWait, let's rebuild the scaffold step by step. Starting with the triazole part: the original is Nc1c(C(=O)c2cccc...)cnn1. Removing the substituent (C(=O)...) gives Nc1cccnn1. Then connected to the benzene ring via a single bond: so it becomes Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. However, the original connection is from the triazole's nitrogen (the last 'n' in 'nn1') to the benzene's carbon. So in SMILES notation, that would be Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. But when written properly, the benzene ring would be c1ccccc1, and the connection is via a single bond. So combining them: Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. But wait, the triazole's ring closure is at 'n1', so the SMILES would be Nc1ccc(nn1)c2ccccc2. No, that's not right. Let me try constructing it again.\n\nOriginal triazole part: Nc1c(...)cnn1. After removing substituents, it's Nc1cccnn1. The 'c1' starts the ring, followed by N, then three carbons (c, c, c), then two nitrogens (n, n), closing back to c1. Wait, that would make a six-membered ring: N-C-C-C-C-N-N-C? No, that's not possible. Maybe it's a five-membered ring. Let's count:\n\n- N connected to C1.\n- C1 connected to C2 (from the 'c' after Nc1).\n- C2 connected to C3 (from the next 'c').\n- C3 connected to N4 (from the 'n').\n- N4 connected to N5 (next 'n').\n- N5 connected back to C1 (from the '1' in 'nn1').\n\nThat's a five-membered ring: C1 (connected to N), C2, C3, N4, N5, and back to C1. So the ring has five atoms: C1, C2, C3, N4, N5. That's a five-membered ring with three carbons and two nitrogens. So the SMILES would be Nc1ccc(nn1)... but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES for the triazole part is Nc1cnncc1. Wait, no. Let me try writing it correctly. The correct SMILES for a 1,2,4-triazole is c1ncnn1. But in this case, the structure is Nc1c...cnn1. Maybe it's a different arrangement.\n\nRegardless, the main point is to connect the two aromatic rings (the triazole-like and benzene) via the single bond, removing all substituents. The exact SMILES might be Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. But I need to verify if this is valid. Alternatively, the correct SMILES could be Nc1cnncc1-c2ccccc2. Maybe the scaffold is Nc1cnncc1-c2ccccc2. Alternatively, perhaps the triazole part is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens and three carbons, connected to a benzene. Let's think of it as N-C-C-C-N-N connected in a ring. That's five members: N, C, C, C, N, N? No, that's six. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is the triazole ring connected to the benzene via a single bond, with all substituents removed. So the SMILES would be Nc1cnncc1-c2ccccc2. But I'm not sure. To check, perhaps using a SMILES parser would help, but since I can't do that, I'll proceed with the best guess.\n\nAnother approach: the original molecule has two separate rings connected by a single bond. One is the triazole-like ring (N-containing) and the benzene with fluorine. The other benzene attached via carbonyl is a substituent and should be removed. The connecting bond between the triazole and the benzene (with F) is part of the scaffold. Removing F and the carbonyl-attached benzene, the scaffold is the triazole ring connected to the benzene. So the SMILES would be Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. But the exact arrangement of atoms in the triazole ring might differ. Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is Nc1cnncc1-c2ccccc2.\n\nWait, let's break down the original SMILES again: Nc1c(C(=O)c2cccc(C(O)CO)c2)cnn1-c3ccc(F)cc3.\n\nThe main rings are:\n\n- The first ring: starts with Nc1...cnn1. This is a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. The substituent on C2 is C(=O)c2cccc..., which is a side chain.\n\n- The second ring: c3ccc(F)cc3, connected via a single bond to the first ring.\n\nSo, after removing substituents, the first ring becomes Nc1c([CH])cnn1, where [CH] is a carbon with a hydrogen (since the original had a substituent). But in SMILES, implicit hydrogens are added. So the scaffold's first ring would be Nc1cccnn1 connected to the benzene ring c3ccccc3 (without F).\n\nSo combining them: Nc1cccnn1-c3ccccc3. But how to represent the connection. The original connection is from the first ring's last nitrogen (nn1) to the benzene's carbon. So in SMILES, that would be Nc1c(C)cnn1-c3ccccc3. Wait, but the C here is part of the ring. Let me try writing it as Nc1ccc(nn1)c2ccccc2. Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. Yes, that seems plausible. So the final SMILES would be Nc1cccnn1-c2ccccc2. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact arrangement of the triazole ring. However, given the input and the definition, this seems like the correct approach.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is O=C(NCC1CCCO1)C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1)NC(=O)c1ccccc1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the rings and connecting bonds. Let's parse the structure. The molecule has multiple parts connected by amide groups (NC=O) and an enamine (C(=C...)). The main rings are the benzene rings. The central part seems to have a cyclohexane ring (from NCC1CCCO1), but wait, the ring here is actually a five-membered ring (CCCO1 makes it a five-membered ring with one oxygen). Wait, 1CCCO1 would be a four-membered ring? Wait, the SMILES notation for the ring closure is 1. So the fragment NCC1CCCO1: the ring starts at position 1, so the atoms are C1 connected to C-C-C-O and then back to C1. That makes a five-membered ring: C1 connected to C, C, C, O, and back to C1. So that's a tetrahydrofuran ring attached via a CH2 group to the nitrogen.\n\nNext, the other parts: C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1) is a substituent where the =C is attached to a benzene ring with a nitro group. Then there's another NC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is a benzamide group.\n\nThe Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and exocyclic groups. So, the rings plus the connecting bonds. Let's look for all ring systems. The benzene rings are obvious. The cycloether (five-membered ring) is another ring. Are they connected via bonds that are part of the scaffold?\n\nThe central part might be the connecting bonds. The original molecule has a central carbon connected to two amide groups (N-C=O) and the enamine (C(=C...)). These connecting groups might be part of the scaffold if they link rings. But according to the definition, we remove functional groups and side chains, so the connecting bonds are only those that are part of the ring systems or the linkers between rings.\n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold is rings plus the linkers that connect them. So, any atom that's part of a bridge between rings or a chain connecting rings is kept. Functional groups like amide (CONH) would be removed, as well as substituents like nitro groups, ethers, etc.\n\nSo breaking down the input structure:\n\n- The benzene ring with nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) is a substituent on a benzene ring. So the nitro is a functional group and should be removed, leaving the benzene.\n\n- The five-membered ring (from NCC1CCCO1) is a ring, but the side chain (NCC...) might be part of the scaffold? Wait, the NCC is connected to the ring. Wait, the structure is NCC1CCCO1. The N is connected to CH2, which is connected to the ring. So the CH2 is a side chain, so the ring is the five-membered (O-containing), and the CH2-N is a side chain, which should be removed. So the ring itself (the five-membered) is part of the scaffold if connected to other rings.\n\nBut how are the rings connected? Let's look at the main structure. The central carbon is connected to two amide groups and an enamine. The enamine part is C(=C...), which connects to another benzene ring. The amide groups connect to the five-membered ring and another benzene.\n\nWait, perhaps the core structure is the two benzene rings connected via a central structure. Let me try to sketch this mentally.\n\nThe main chain might be:\n\nBenzene ring (from c1ccccc1) connected via CONH-C-(=O)NC(=O)-C(=C)-... but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the central part could be a chain that connects the rings.\n\nWait, the SMILES is O=C(NCC1CCCO1)C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1)NC(=O)c1ccccc1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe central carbon is the one attached to two carbonyl groups (O=C). So it's C(O=C(...))(O=C(...)) and another substituent which is =C(...).\n\nWait, the central atom is a carbon with three groups: O=C-NCC1CCCO1, O=C-N-C(=O)c1ccccc1, and a =C group attached to another benzene ring (with nitro).\n\nBut this central carbon is part of a larger structure. However, the Murcko scaffold would remove substituents except for rings and connecting bonds.\n\nSo the rings here are:\n\n1. The benzene ring from c1ccccc1 (the last part, NC(=O)c1ccccc1).\n\n2. The benzene ring from c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1 (the part after =Cc1...).\n\n3. The five-membered ring from NCC1CCCO1 (the 1CCCO1 part is a five-membered ring: C1-C-C-C-O-C1? Wait, the SMILES is NCC1CCCO1. So the ring is 1CCCO1: C1 connected to C, then C, then C, then O, then back to C1. That's a five-membered ring: C1-C-C-C-O-C1? Wait, no, the ring closure is at the end. So the sequence is C1 (atom 1), then C, C, C, O, and then back to C1. So the ring is C-C-C-C-O connected in a ring, making a five-membered ring (like tetrahydrofuran).\n\nSo three rings: two benzene and one five-membered oxygen ring.\n\nNow, how are these connected? The central part is the carbon with two amide groups and an enamine. The amide groups are O=C-N-... So the central carbon is connected via CONH groups to the five-membered ring and another benzene. The enamine part (C(=C...)) connects to the nitro benzene.\n\nBut all these connecting groups (amide, enamine) are likely considered side chains or functional groups, so they should be removed, leaving only the rings and the bonds that directly connect them.\n\nWait, but Murcko scaffold includes the linkers between rings. For example, if two benzene rings are connected by a methyl group, the methyl would be part of the scaffold. Wait, no: according to the definition, the Murcko scaffold is the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So any atoms that are part of the linker between rings are kept, but side chains (like substituents on the rings) are removed.\n\nSo, the process would be to remove all substituents from the rings, but keep the linker chains that connect the rings.\n\nIn this case, the nitro group on the benzene is a substituent, so it's removed. The oxygen-containing five-membered ring has a CH2-NH- group attached, which is a side chain (since the NH is part of the amide), so that should be removed. The amide groups (O=C-N-) are functional groups and should be removed, leaving the rings connected by any linker atoms that are part of the scaffold.\n\nSo let's try to identify the core:\n\nOriginal structure has:\n\n- Benzene ring A (from NC(=O)c1ccccc1) connected via CONH to central carbon.\n\n- Central carbon connected via another CONH to the five-membered ring (via NCC1...).\n\n- Central carbon also has a =C group connected to benzene ring B (with nitro).\n\nBut the Murcko scaffold should remove the CONH groups, the nitro, and any other substituents, leaving the rings and the connecting bonds.\n\nWait, but the connecting bonds would be the atoms that are between the rings. For example, if two rings are connected by a single bond, that's part of the scaffold. If they're connected via a chain, like -CH2-CH2-, that's part of the scaffold.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the central carbon is part of a linker connecting the rings. Let's see:\n\nAfter removing the functional groups, the scaffold would be the rings connected by the bonds that were part of the original structure without the side chains.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central carbon is part of the scaffold if it's part of a linker. But perhaps in this case, the central carbon is part of a linker that connects three rings? That seems unlikely. Maybe the actual scaffold is the three rings connected via the central carbon and any necessary bonds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central structure is a fused system? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to iteratively remove all terminal atoms that are not part of a ring. The algorithm for Murcko scaffold involves removing all atoms that are not in rings or in the linker chains between rings. So, starting from the original structure, you prune terminal non-ring atoms.\n\nLet's apply that approach:\n\n1. Identify all rings. In the input, there are three rings: two benzene rings and one five-membered oxygen-containing ring.\n\n2. Identify the bridge/linker atoms connecting these rings.\n\nBut how are they connected? Let's look at the connectivity.\n\nThe five-membered ring (from 1CCCO1) is attached via a CH2 group to a nitrogen (NCC1...). That nitrogen is part of an amide group (O=C-N-...). The amide is connected to the central carbon.\n\nThe central carbon is connected to another amide group (O=C-N-...) which is attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).\n\nAdditionally, the central carbon has a double bond to a carbon which is attached to another benzene ring (with nitro).\n\nSo, the central carbon is connected to three groups: two amides and a double bond to a substituted benzene.\n\nIn terms of scaffold extraction:\n\n- The nitro group is a substituent on the benzene, so removed.\n\n- The amide groups (O=C-NH-) are functional groups, so the NH and O=C are removed, leaving the central carbon connected to the rings via the linkers.\n\nWait, but the linker would be the path between the rings. For example, if the benzene rings are connected via the central carbon and the five-membered ring is connected via a chain, then those connections would be part of the scaffold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Murcko scaffold here would merge the rings connected via the central carbon, but since the central carbon is not part of a ring, it's a linker.\n\nWait, the central carbon is part of the linker between the rings. So the scaffold would consist of the three rings connected via the central carbon and any other linker atoms.\n\nBut let's see. If we remove the functional groups and side chains:\n\n- The amide groups (O=C-N-) would be removed, so the nitrogen attached to the central carbon would be part of a linker? Or is the nitrogen part of a side chain?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use a tool like RDKit to perform the Murcko scaffold extraction. But since I have to do this manually, let's proceed step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to imagine the structure without any substituents. The main rings are:\n\n1. Benzene ring (from c1ccccc1).\n\n2. Benzene ring (from c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1) without the nitro group.\n\n3. Five-membered oxygen ring (1CCCO1).\n\nNow, how are these connected? The central carbon is connected to the two amide groups and the enamine. If we remove the amide groups, the central carbon would be connected to the five-membered ring via a CH2 group (from NCC1...), but that CH2 is part of the side chain. Wait, the NCC1... part is N-C-C (the CH2 group) connected to the five-membered ring. So the N is part of the amide group (O=C-N-), which is a functional group. So removing that, the five-membered ring would lose the CH2-N- part, leaving just the ring.\n\nSimilarly, the other amide group (O=C-N-) connected to the benzene ring would be removed, leaving the benzene ring attached via a single bond to the central carbon.\n\nThe enamine part (C(=C...)): the central carbon has a double bond to a CH group, which is attached to the benzene ring (without nitro). So removing the nitro group, that benzene is kept, and the double bond might be part of the linker.\n\nSo, after removing all functional groups and side chains, the scaffold would consist of:\n\n- The two benzene rings connected via the central carbon and the double bond.\n\n- The five-membered oxygen ring connected via a linker to the central carbon.\n\nBut wait, if the amide groups are removed, then the central carbon is connected to the five-membered ring via a CH2 group (from the original NCC1...), but that CH2 would be a side chain. Wait, no: if the amide group (O=C-NH-) is removed, then the NH is part of the side chain. So the five-membered ring is connected to the central carbon via a CH2 group? Or is the CH2 part of the linker?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the five-membered ring is not connected to the central carbon in the scaffold. Let me think.\n\nOriginal connection: central carbon -> NH -> CH2 -> five-membered ring. If the amide group (O=C-NH-) is removed, then the NH and CH2 are side chains, so the five-membered ring would be disconnected. Similarly, the other amide group connects to another benzene via NH, which would be removed, disconnecting that benzene.\n\nBut that can't be right, because then the scaffold would only include the benzene attached via the enamine. But the enamine part (C(=C...)) is a double bond to a CH group attached to a benzene. If the nitro is removed, that benzene remains. The double bond might be considered part of the linker.\n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold definition says to leave ring systems and connecting bonds. So any non-ring atoms that are part of the path connecting two rings are kept.\n\nIn the enamine part: C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1) becomes C(=Cc1cccc([N+])c1) after removing nitro, but then the [N+] is still a substituent. Wait, no: the nitro is a substituent, so removing it leaves the benzene ring. The C=C is part of the linker between the central carbon and the benzene ring.\n\nSo, the central carbon is connected via a double bond (C=C) to a benzene ring. That double bond would be part of the connecting bonds, so it's kept.\n\nSimilarly, the other connections: the central carbon is connected via single bonds to where the amide groups were. But if those amide groups are removed, then those bonds would be to nothing. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Perhaps the central carbon is only connected via the double bond to one benzene, and the other connections are lost, making the scaffold just that benzene and the central carbon? No, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central carbon is part of a linker connecting two benzene rings and the five-membered ring. But after removing the functional groups, perhaps the central carbon and the connecting bonds form the scaffold.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's try to draw it:\n\nOriginal molecule:\n\nCentral carbon (C) is attached to:\n\n1. O=C-N-CH2- five-membered ring.\n\n2. O=C-N- benzene ring.\n\n3. =C-CH2- benzene (with nitro).\n\nAfter removing functional groups (O=C-NH, nitro):\n\n- The five-membered ring is connected via CH2 to N, which is connected to C (central). But since the amide is removed, the NH and O=C are gone, so the connection would be just CH2-C? No, the amide is O=C-NH-CH2..., removing the amide would leave just the CH2 connected to the central carbon? Or is the NH part of the linker?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central carbon is connected directly to the five-membered ring via a single bond (if the amide group is considered a side chain). Similarly, the connection to the other benzene via the enamine (C=C) remains.\n\nBut this is unclear. Another approach: look for examples of Murcko scaffolds. Typically, the scaffold includes all rings and the bonds that connect them, excluding any branches. For example, in a structure like benzene-CH2-benzene, the scaffold is benzene-CH2-benzene. If there's a benzene connected via an amide to another ring, the amide is removed, and the rings are considered disconnected unless connected by another linker.\n\nIn this case, the central carbon has three connections. If two of them are to rings via linkers, and one is a functional group, then the scaffold would include those two rings and the connecting path.\n\nBut perhaps in this molecule, the central carbon is connected via a double bond to one benzene (through =C-), and via a single bond to another benzene (through the amide, which is removed), so that connection is lost. And via another single bond to the five-membered ring (through the amide, which is removed), so that connection is also lost. Therefore, the scaffold would only include the benzene attached via the double bond and the central carbon? That doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enamine part (C=C) is considered part of the linker. So the central carbon is connected via a double bond to a CH group, which is connected to a benzene. So the linker is C=C-CH, which connects the central carbon to the benzene. But the CH is part of the benzene ring (since it's c1cccc...), so maybe that's part of the ring.\n\nWait, the benzene ring attached via the enamine is written as c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1. So the benzene has a substituent (nitro) and a CH2 group from the =C-CH2-... Wait, no: the SMILES is C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1). So the central carbon is double-bonded to a C, which is connected to a benzene via a single bond. So the structure is C(=C-c1cccc(...)c1). Therefore, the benzene is attached via a single bond to the C, which is double-bonded to the central carbon.\n\nSo in this case, the linker between the central carbon and the benzene is the C-C (double bond) and then the single bond to the benzene. So the linker is C-C. The benzene is a ring, so the linker is the two carbons (the central C and the adjacent C). But since the adjacent C is part of the linker, it's kept. Then the nitro group on the benzene is removed.\n\nSo the scaffold would include that benzene connected via the two-carbon linker (C=C) to the central carbon. But the central carbon is also connected to other parts. However, if those other parts are functional groups (like amides), then they are removed.\n\nBut then, what about the other benzene ring (from NC(=O)c1ccccc1)? The connection is via an amide (O=C-N-...). Removing the amide would leave the benzene connected via a single bond to the central carbon. But the amide's nitrogen is part of the side chain, so removing it would disconnect the benzene from the central carbon.\n\nSimilarly, the five-membered ring is connected via an amide and a CH2 group. Removing the amide would disconnect it from the central carbon.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining connection is the benzene via the enamine linker (C=C). So the scaffold would be that benzene connected via the C=C linker to the central carbon. But the central carbon has no other connections, so it's just a benzene with a vinyl group (C=C). But the vinyl group is part of the linker, so maybe the scaffold is the benzene plus the C=C, but since there's no other ring connected, that's it?\n\nWait, but the central carbon is also connected to another benzene via the amide, which we removed. So that benzene is disconnected. Similarly, the five-membered ring is disconnected.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. The Murcko scaffold is the union of all rings and the connecting atoms. So any atom that is part of a ring or part of a path connecting two rings is kept. All other atoms (side chains, functional groups) are removed.\n\nIn the input molecule, there are three rings:\n\n1. Benzene ring A (from c1ccccc1).\n\n2. Benzene ring B (from c1cccc(...)c1).\n\n3. Five-membered ring C (from 1CCCO1).\n\nNow, are these rings connected via any linker atoms?\n\n- Benzene ring B is connected via a vinyl group (C=C) to the central carbon.\n\n- The central carbon is connected via amide groups to benzene ring A and five-membered ring C.\n\nIf we remove the amide groups (O=C-NH-), then the connections from the central carbon to benzene A and ring C are lost. So only benzene B remains connected via the vinyl group.\n\nBut then the scaffold would be benzene B with a vinyl group (C=C), which is not part of any other ring. But since the central carbon is not part of a ring, it's just a substituent, which would be removed. So benzene B would be the scaffold? But that doesn't seem right, as there are other rings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the five-membered ring C is connected via some other path. Let me check the original SMILES again: NCC1CCCO1. So the five-membered ring is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a nitrogen, which is part of an amide group (O=C-N-). Removing the amide group would disconnect the ring C from the central carbon.\n\nSo, after removing all functional groups and side chains, the only rings left would be the three rings, but disconnected. But Murcko scaffold should retain the largest framework of connected rings and linkers.\n\nWait, perhaps the central carbon is part of a linker connecting benzene B to another part. If the central carbon is connected via the double bond to benzene B, and via another path to another ring.\n\nWait, but if the other connections are lost due to removing functional groups, then the scaffold would only include benzene B and the connecting vinyl group. But vinyl groups are not part of the scaffold unless they connect to another ring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct scaffold is the largest ring system with linkers. In this case, the two benzene rings and the five-membered ring might be connected via the central carbon and the linkers. But after removing the functional groups, perhaps the scaffold is a central carbon connected to three rings via single bonds. But that's unlikely, as the central carbon would need to be part of the linker.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold consists of the two benzene rings connected via a central structure. Let's look for a framework that includes multiple rings connected through linkers.\n\nBut without the amide and nitro groups, the structure would be:\n\nCentral carbon connected via C=C to benzene B (no nitro), and connected via single bonds to two other groups (originally amides, now removed). So those two single bonds would be to nothing, leaving the central carbon with only the double bond to benzene B. But that's a terminal group, so it's removed. Therefore, the scaffold would be benzene B only. That can't be right.\n\nI must be missing something. Let me think again. The original SMILES is O=C(NCC1CCCO1)C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1)NC(=O)c1ccccc1.\n\nBreaking it into parts:\n\n- The central carbon is part of a ketone (O=C) attached to three groups:\n\n1. NCC1CCCO1: This is a chain leading to the five-membered ring.\n\n2. (=Cc1cccc(...)c1): A double bond to a CH group attached to a benzene with nitro.\n\n3. NC(=O)c1ccccc1: An amide leading to another benzene.\n\nAfter removing all functional groups (amide, nitro, etc.), what remains?\n\n- The five-membered ring (1CCCO1) remains, but connected via CH2-N- which is part of the amide. Removing the amide leaves the five-membered ring disconnected.\n\n- The benzene with nitro becomes a plain benzene (nitro removed).\n\n- The other benzene remains.\n\nThe central carbon is connected via double bond to the CH-benzene (nitro removed), and via single bonds to where the amides were. But those amide groups are removed, so those bonds are broken.\n\nThus, the scaffold would be the benzene rings connected via the double bond and the central carbon. But the central carbon isn't part of a ring, so it's a linker. So the scaffold is benzene B connected via C=C to the central carbon. But the central carbon has no other connections, so it's a terminal group and thus removed. Leaving just benzene B.\n\nBut that doesn't include the other rings. There must be a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the five-membered ring is connected via a linker to the central carbon. Let's see: the five-membered ring is connected via CH2-NH-... to the central carbon. Removing the amide (O=C-NH-) leaves the CH2 connected to the central carbon. So the five-membered ring is connected via CH2 to the central carbon. That CH2 would be part of the linker. So the scaffold would include the five-membered ring connected via CH2 to the central carbon, which is connected via C=C to benzene B. But what about the other benzene (A)? It was connected via an amide, which is removed, so it's disconnected.\n\nThus, the scaffold would be five-membered ring - CH2 - C(C=C benzene B). But the central carbon is connected to CH2 (from ring C) and C=C (to benzene B). Since those are linkers, they're kept. So the scaffold is the five-membered ring connected via CH2-C(C=C)-benzene B.\n\nBut wait, the CH2 is a single bond from the central carbon to the five-membered ring. The C=C is a double bond to benzene B. So the scaffold would be:\n\nfive-membered ring - CH2 - C(C=C benzene B)\n\nBut that's a chain of CH2-C-C=C-benzene. The CH2 is part of the linker between the five-membered ring and the central carbon, which is part of the linker to benzene B.\n\nTherefore, the Murcko scaffold would be the five-membered ring connected via CH2-C-C=C to the benzene ring.\n\nBut the central carbon (the middle C in CH2-C-C=C) is part of the linker. So the scaffold includes all those atoms.\n\nBut wait, the central carbon is connected to three groups: CH2 (to five-membered), C=C (to benzene B), and another group which was originally connected to the other benzene via an amide. Since that amide is removed, the central carbon loses that connection, leaving it with two connections: CH2 and C=C. However, a carbon with only two bonds would be a problem, implying it's missing a connection. But in reality, the central carbon has three bonds in the original structure (two amides and the enamine). After removing the amides, it has two bonds (CH2 and C=C), which is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the correct scaffold includes the central carbon connected to both the CH2 (to five-membered) and the C=C (to benzene B), forming a branch.\n\nBut that would mean the scaffold is:\n\nfive-membered ring - CH2 - C(=C) - benzene B.\n\nBut the central carbon has a double bond to the C in C=C, so the structure would be:\n\nfive-membered ring - CH2 - C(=CH-) - benzene B.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. The enamine part is C(=Cc1cccc...), which is a double bond between the central carbon and another carbon, which is connected to the benzene. So after removing the nitro group, it's C(=Cc1cccc...), which becomes C(=Cc1ccccc1), meaning the central carbon is double-bonded to a CH group, which is attached to a benzene.\n\nSo the linker is C=C-CH, which connects to the benzene. The CH is part of the benzene ring? No, the benzene is c1ccccc1, so the CH is part of the benzene's ring. Wait, no: the SMILES for the benzene part is c1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1. When the nitro is removed, it's c1cccccc1 (but actually, the original is c1cccc([N+])... but I'm removing the nitro, so it's just c1cccccc1? No, the original is a benzene with a substituent. Removing the substituent leaves a benzene ring with six carbons, all connected in the ring. So the attachment point is one of the carbons.\n\nSo the structure after scaffold extraction would be:\n\nfive-membered ring (from 1CCCO1) connected via CH2 to the central carbon, which is connected via C=C to a benzene ring. Additionally, the central carbon was connected to another benzene via an amide, but that connection is removed.\n\nThus, the scaffold includes the five-membered ring, the CH2-C(=C)-linker, and the benzene ring. But wait, the central carbon has a double bond to the C which is attached to the benzene. So the structure is:\n\nfive-membered ring - CH2 - C(=C) - benzene.\n\nBut that's a four-carbon linker (five-membered ring - CH2 - C - C(=C) - benzene). Wait, no: the central carbon is connected to CH2 (from the five-membered) and to the C=C. So the structure is:\n\nfive-membered ring - CH2 - C(=C) - benzene.\n\nBut the C(=C) would imply a double bond between the central carbon and the next carbon, which is attached to the benzene. So the linker is CH2-C-C (with a double bond between the central C and the adjacent C), and the adjacent C is part of the benzene ring.\n\nBut wait, the benzene is connected via a single bond to that C. So the full structure is:\n\nfive-membered ring - CH2 - C(=C) - C - benzene.\n\nBut that's not possible, because the C attached to the benzene would have four bonds. Unless it's part of the benzene ring.\n\nAlternatively, the benzene is connected via a single bond to the C that's double-bonded to the central carbon. So the structure would be:\n\nfive-membered ring - CH2 - C(=C - benzene).\n\nBut the benzene is a separate ring, connected via a single bond to the C.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Perhaps the correct scaffold is the two benzene rings and the five-membered ring connected via the central carbon and the appropriate linkers.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is that the Murcko scaffold is the two benzene rings connected by the central carbon and the enamine linker, and the five-membered ring is disconnected. But without the five-membered ring's connection, it's not part of the scaffold.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with what I think is the most likely scaffold: the two benzene rings connected via the central carbon and the enamine linker (C=C), forming a biphenyl-like structure with a double bond. The five-membered ring is connected via the amide which is removed, so it's not part of the scaffold. The nitro group is removed from the benzene.\n\nThus, the scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by a central structure. Let me visualize:\n\nBenzene A (from NC(=O)c1ccccc1) connected via the central carbon and the enamine to Benzene B (with nitro removed).\n\nBut the connection between the central carbon and Benzene A is via an amide, which is removed. So Benzene A is disconnected. Only Benzene B remains connected via the enamine linker.\n\nBut that leaves only Benzene B and the central carbon with the double bond. Since the central carbon isn't part of a ring, it's a side chain and thus removed, leaving just Benzene B. But that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the five-membered ring connected to Benzene B via the central carbon and the enamine linker. So the scaffold would be five-membered ring - CH2 - C(=C) - benzene B.\n\nIn SMILES, that would be C1CCCO1 (the five-membered ring) connected via CH2-C(=C)c1ccccc1 (the benzene with the double bond). So the SMILES would be C1CCCO1CC(=C)c1ccccc1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the five-membered ring's connection is via the CH2-N-amide, which is removed, so the five-membered ring isn't connected to anything. So the only remaining connected parts are the central carbon connected via C=C to benzene B, making the scaffold C=Cc1ccccc1 (but that's just styrene, which is a single benzene with a vinyl group). But that doesn't include any other rings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the two benzene rings connected via the central carbon and the enamine linker, ignoring the five-membered ring and the other benzene since their connections are lost. But that would mean the scaffold is the benzene connected via C=C to the central carbon, which is connected to nothing else. So again, just the benzene with a vinyl group.\n\nThis is really confusing. Given that the input molecule has multiple rings but the connecting groups are functional, the correct scaffold is likely the largest ring system with linkers. Considering that, perhaps the correct scaffold is the benzene ring attached via the enamine (C=C) to the central carbon, which is connected to the five-membered ring via a CH2 group. So the SMILES would be O1C2CCC1C2CC(=C)c1ccccc1. Wait, but the five-membered ring is O1C2CCC1C2 (no, the five-membered ring is C1CCCO1). So the scaffold would be C1CCCO1CC(=C)c1ccccc1.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another way: the original molecule has a central carbon linked to three different parts. After removing functional groups, the only remaining parts are the rings and the connecting bonds. If the central carbon is part of the linker between the five-membered ring and the benzene B, then the scaffold would be the five-membered ring connected via CH2-C(=C) to benzene B.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the scaffold includes the two benzene rings connected via the central carbon and the enamine, and the five-membered ring is disconnected. But since the five-membered ring's connection is via an amide (which is removed), it's not part of the scaffold. Therefore, the scaffold is the benzene rings connected via the enamine linker.\n\nWait, but how are the two benzene rings connected? One is via the enamine (C=C), the other via an amide which is removed. So only one benzene remains connected.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the input and the definition, the correct Murcko scaffold is the rings and connecting bonds. The answer is likely the benzene ring attached via the double bond, and the five-membered ring connected via the CH2 group, forming a scaffold of the five-membered ring connected to the benzene via CH2-C=C.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given that, I'll write the SMILES as C1CCCO1CC(=Cc2ccccc2). Which would be the five-membered ring connected via CH2-C(=C) to a benzene.\n\nBut checking the SMILES syntax, it would be O=C(...) parts are removed. So the scaffold would be:\n\nThe five-membered ring (C1CCCO1) connected via CH2-C(=C) to benzene (c2ccccc2). So the SMILES is C1CCCO1CC(=Cc2ccccc2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the connecting bonds are correct. The original connection is NCC1CCCO1. After removing the amide (O=C-N-), the remaining part is CC1CCCO1 connected to the central carbon via CH2. So the central carbon is connected to CH2-CC1CCCO1, but the central carbon is also connected to C(=C...).\n\nThus, the scaffold would be C1CCCO1 (five-membered ring) connected via CH2-C(=C) to benzene. But the CH2 is part of the linker. So the SMILES would be C1CCCO1CC(=Cc2ccccc2).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is the two benzene rings connected via the central carbon with the double bond, but that would require the central carbon to be connected to both, which isn't the case after removing the amides.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll go with the scaffold being the two benzene rings connected via the double bond, with the five-membered ring disconnected. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)C=Cc2ccccc2. But this ignores the five-membered ring.\n\nAlternatively, considering all rings connected via the central carbon, but that's not possible after removing the amides.\n\nI think I need to conclude that the correct Murcko scaffold is the benzene rings connected via the enamine linker, resulting in the SMILES C(=Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2. But wait, that's a central carbon double-bonded to one benzene and single-bonded to another. But the central carbon would have only two bonds, which isn't possible. So maybe the correct scaffold is the two benzene rings connected by a double bond and a single bond through the central carbon. But that would require the central carbon to have three bonds, which isn't possible without additional atoms.\n\nAlternatively, the scaffold is the two benzene rings connected via a vinyl group (C=C), making the SMILES c1ccc(cc1)C=Cc2ccccc2. This is a biphenyl connected by a double bond, which is a common scaffold.\n\nGiven that the input molecule has two benzene rings connected via a central structure with a double bond, and the other connections are via amides which are removed, the Murcko scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by the C=C linker. Therefore, the SMILES would be c1ccc(C=Cc2ccccc2)cc1. But wait, that's not quite right. The correct SMILES for two benzene rings connected by a vinyl group (C=C) would be c1ccccc1C=Cc2ccccc2. However, that's not a valid SMILES because the double bond would need to be between two carbons. So perhaps the correct SMILES is C(=Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which represents a central carbon double-bonded to one benzene and single-bonded to another. But that carbon would have only three bonds, which isn't possible. To correct this, there must be another atom in the linker.\n\nWait, the enamine part is C(=Cc1cccc([N+](=O)[O-])c1). Removing the nitro gives C(=Cc1ccccc1). So the central carbon is double-bonded to a CH group, which is attached to a benzene. So the linker is C=C-CH (but the CH is part of the benzene ring). Therefore, the scaffold would be the benzene ring attached via a vinyl group (C=C) to the central carbon, which is connected to nothing else. But that leaves the central carbon with only one bond, which isn't possible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide an answer, I'll conclude that the correct Murcko scaffold is the two benzene rings connected via the central carbon and the enamine linker, resulting in the SMILES C(c1ccccc1)(=Cc2ccccc2). However, this may not be valid due to valence. Alternatively, the correct answer is the two benzene rings connected by a double bond, which would be c1ccc(C=Cc2ccccc2)cc1. But in SMILES notation, this would be written as C1=CC=C(C=C1)C=CC2=CC=CC=C2. However, this structure is a stilbene, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, the correct scaffold is the five-membered ring connected to one benzene via a linker, and the other benzene disconnected. But without more information, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the correct scaffold is the two benzene rings connected via the central carbon and the enamine linker, forming a structure like C(=Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but adjusting for valence. To correct valence, perhaps the central carbon is part of a larger ring, but that's not the case here.\n\nAfter reconsidering, the correct scaffold likely includes the two benzene rings connected via the double bond from the enamine, resulting in the SMILES C=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2. However, this places the double bond between two carbons each connected to a benzene ring, which is valid. Thus, the SMILES would be C=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2.",

The main structure has a benzene ring (the c1ccc...cc1 part). Then there's a bicyclic system attached. The substituents like the double bond (C=C), the ester group (C(=O)OC), and the methyl groups (N3C) are side chains or functional groups. I should remove those. The core would be the benzene ring connected to the bicyclic system without the substituents. Let me check the rings again. The benzene is one ring. The other part has two fused rings: a 3-membered and a 6-membered? Wait, the C2CC3CCC...N3C part. Maybe a cyclohexane fused with a smaller ring. After removing the exocyclic groups, the scaffold should be the benzene connected to the fused bicyclic system via a single bond. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(c2CC3CCCCN3C2)cc1. Let me verify if all side chains are stripped. The original has C=C as a substituent on the benzene, which is removed. The ester group and the methyl on the nitrogen are also gone. Yes, that's the core rings and connecting bonds.",

        "raw_cot": "Alright, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction problem. The input SMILES is CC(C)=Cc1ccc2cc(NC(=O)C3CC3)ncc2c1. First, I need to identify the ring systems and connecting bonds.\n\nLooking at the structure, the main part seems to be a bicyclic system. The SMILES starts with CC(C)=C..., which is likely a side chain. Then there's c1ccc2cc...ncc2c1. The 'c' indicates aromatic carbons, so there's a benzene ring here. The numbering suggests a fused ring structure. The part after the benzene is 2cc(NC(=O)C3CC3)ncc2c1. The 'n' might be a nitrogen in a ring, forming another aromatic ring like pyridine or part of a fused system.\n\nThe NC(=O)C3CC3 is an amide group attached to a cyclopropane (C3CC3). That's probably a functional group, so it should be removed. The side chains like CC(C)=C and the cyclopropane amide are not part of the scaffold. \n\nThe rings are the benzene and the fused ring with nitrogen. The connecting bonds would be the ones that link these rings together. After removing the side chains and functional groups, the scaffold should be the fused bicyclic system without the substituents. \n\nSo, breaking it down: the main rings are the benzene (c1ccc2...) fused with a pyridine-like ring (ncc2c1). The connecting bonds are the ones shared between the two rings. Stripping away the side chains (CC(C)=C and NC(=O)C3CC3) leaves the fused benzene and pyridine rings. \n\nTherefore, the Murcko scaffold would be the bicyclic system c1ccc2cncc2c1. Wait, let me check the connectivity. The original SMILES has c1ccc2cc...ncc2c1. So the second ring starts at position 2 of the first benzene. The atoms in the second ring are cc(NC(=O)...)ncc2. Removing the substituents, the second ring would be cc...ncc2, forming a five-membered ring? Or is it a six-membered ring? Let me count. The first ring is six-membered (c1ccc2...). The second part is cc followed by NC(=O)... but if we remove that substituent, the second ring would be the positions connected as c1ccc2ccncc2c1. Wait, that would be a six-membered ring with a nitrogen. So the fused rings are two six-membered rings, one benzene and one pyridine, fused together. \n\nSo the scaffold should be c1ccc2cnccc2c1. Wait, let me write the SMILES correctly. The original is c1ccc2cc(...)ncc2c1. If the substituents are removed, the core would be c1ccc2ccncc2c1. Let me visualize: position 1 is the first carbon of the benzene. Then positions 2-6 form the benzene, and the second ring starts at position 2 (c2). The sequence cc(...)ncc2 suggests that the second ring has atoms cc...ncc, which would be five atoms, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let's parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nOriginal SMILES after the side chain: c1ccc2cc(NC(=O)C3CC3)ncc2c1. Breaking down the rings:\n\n- The first ring is c1 (atom 1), then three c (atoms 2-4), then a connection to the second ring c2. So the first ring is c1ccc2... The second ring starts at c2. The second ring's structure is cc(NC(=O)...)ncc2. So starting at c2, next is c (atom 5), then another c (atom 6) attached to the NC(=O) group, then n (atom 7), c (atom 8), c (atom 9), and back to c2 (atom 2). Wait, that makes the second ring as atoms 2,5,6,7,8,9 forming a six-membered ring? That would be c2, c, c, n, c, c, back to c2. So the second ring is six-membered with a nitrogen. So the fused rings are benzene (c1ccc2...) fused with a pyridine ring (c2cc...ncc2). Removing the substituents (the NC(=O)C3CC3 and the CC(C)=C group), the scaffold would be the two fused rings: c1ccc2ccncc2c1. But wait, the original has cc(NC(=O)...)ncc2c1. So after removing the NC(=O) part, the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc2ccncc2c1. Let me check if that's correct. The benzene ring (c1ccc2...) and the pyridine ring (c2ccncc2). Yes, that forms a fused bicyclic system. So the output should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc2ccncc2c1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the rings and connecting bonds. Let's parse the SMILES. The main structure starts with c1ccc... which is a benzene ring. There's an oxygen connected to a C2, which is part of another ring. The OC2CCN... part probably forms a morpholine-like ring. Then there's a connection to another ring via the N(c3...). The c3 part is a pyridine or similar aromatic ring with substituents. The N4CCCC4C is a piperidine ring attached to the pyridine.\n\nNow, removing side chains and exocyclic groups. The acetyl group (CC(=O)N) attached to the benzene is a side chain, so that's removed. The methyl group (C) on the NC(C) is also a side chain. The fluorine (F) on the pyridine and the methyl on the piperidine (N4CCCC4C) are exocyclic, so those are gone. The connecting bonds between the rings should stay. \n\nSo the scaffold should be the benzene ring connected via an oxygen to the morpholine ring, which connects to the pyridine ring. The piperidine ring attached to the pyridine's nitrogen would be considered part of the scaffold if it's a ring system. Wait, the piperidine (N4CCCC4C) is a six-membered ring, so that's part of the scaffold. But the methyl on the piperidine (the C in N4CCCC4C) is exocyclic. Wait, the SMILES is N4CCCC4C. So the C is connected to the N4. That would make the piperidine ring with a methyl substituent? No, wait: N4C-C-C-C-C4C. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Let me check. The part is N4CCCC4C. So the nitrogen is part of a ring where the fourth atom is connected back to N4. Wait, N4 is connected to C, then three more Cs, then back to N4? That doesn't form a ring. Wait, maybe it's N4 followed by C, C, C, C4C. So the ring is N4-C-C-C-C4, making a five-membered ring? But then there's an extra C attached. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's N4CCCC4C, which would be a five-membered ring with N4 connected to four Cs and then another C outside? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the correct SMILES for the piperidine would be N4CCCCC4, but here it's N4CCCC4C. Maybe that's a six-membered ring? Let me draw it. N connected to C, then three Cs, then back to N4, and another C. Wait, that would form a five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C-N) and an extra C attached. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the actual structure is a piperidine where one of the carbons is substituted. Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES should be N4C1CCCC1C, but I'm not sure. This part is confusing. Let me try to parse the original SMILES again: the substituent is c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F. So the nitrogen in the pyridine ring (c3) is connected to N4, which is part of a ring: N4CCCC4C. So the ring here is N4 connected to three Cs, then back to N4, making a four-membered ring? No, that can't be. Wait, the SMILES for the piperidine (six-membered) would be N1CCCCC1. But here it's N4CCCC4C. So N4 followed by four Cs, then back to N4, forming a five-membered ring? Wait, N4-C-C-C-C-C4. That would be a five-membered ring with N4 and four Cs, then another C attached. Hmm. Maybe it's a typo and should be N4CCCCC4, making a six-membered ring. But given the input is N4CCCC4C, perhaps the ring is N4-C-C-C-C (four atoms) and then connected back to N4, making a four-membered ring? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a five-membered ring where the fifth atom is the C attached. Wait, perhaps the SMILES is written as N4CCCC4C, which would mean the nitrogen (N4) is connected to three Cs, then the fourth atom is another C connected back to N4, making a four-membered ring (N-C-C-C-N), but that's four atoms. Then the last C is outside, making a substituent. So that would be a four-membered azetidine ring with a methyl group attached. But that seems unusual. Maybe the user made a mistake in the SMILES. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed despite this confusion, assuming that the N4CCCC4C is part of a ring system. \n\nIn any case, the Murcko scaffold includes all ring systems and the connecting bonds. The benzene ring is connected via an oxygen to the morpholine (O-C2CCN...). The morpholine's nitrogen connects to the pyridine ring (c3...). The pyridine's nitrogen is connected to the N4 ring (whatever that is). If N4 is part of a ring, then that ring is part of the scaffold. So the scaffold would be the benzene linked to the morpholine, linked to the pyridine, linked to the N4 ring (if it's a ring system). So the final scaffold would have four rings: benzene, morpholine, pyridine, and the N4 ring (assuming it's a ring). But if the N4 part is not a ring, then perhaps it's a side chain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the N4 part is part of a ring. Let's try to reconstruct. The substituent on the pyridine is N4CCCC4C. Breaking that down: the N4 is connected to a C, then three more Cs, then back to N4, forming a ring. So N4-C-C-C-C-N4. That's a five-membered ring? Wait, N4 connected to four Cs? Wait, in SMILES notation, the ring closure numbers indicate the positions. So N4CCCC4C would be N connected to C, then three Cs, then ring closure 4 back to the N, making a five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C-N), but that's five atoms. Wait, no. Let's count: N4 is the first atom. Then C, C, C, C4. The ring closure 4 connects back to N4, so the sequence is N4-C-C-C-C-C4. That's five atoms in the ring: N4, C, C, C, C, connected back to N4. Wait, that would be a five-membered ring? No, because from N4 to the first C is bond 1, then C-C (bond 2), C-C (bond3), C-C4 (bond4), and C4 back to N4 (bond5). So that's a five-membered ring. So the N4 is part of a five-membered ring. Then there's another C attached to the N4. Wait, the SMILES is N4CCCC4C. So after the ring closure (C4), there's another C. So the structure would be a five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C) connected back to N, and then another C attached to the N. So the N has two substituents: the ring and the C. But that's possible. So the N is in a five-membered ring and has a methyl group attached. \n\nIn the Murcko scaffold, exocyclic groups are removed. So the methyl group (C) attached to the N in the five-membered ring would be removed. So the scaffold would include the five-membered ring (the N4 ring) but not the methyl. So the rings are benzene, morpholine (O-containing six-membered), pyridine, and the five-membered ring (N-C-C-C-C). The connecting bonds are the oxygen between benzene and morpholine, the N connecting morpholine to pyridine, and the N connecting pyridine to the five-membered ring. \n\nPutting it all together, the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1. Wait, but the original substituent on the pyridine's N was N4CCCC4C. After removing the exocyclic C, it becomes N4CCCC4. But that would make the five-membered ring without the methyl. So the scaffold SMILES would have the rings and connecting bonds, without the side chains. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal SMILES: CC(=O)NC(C)c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4C)ncc3F)C2)cc1.\n\nRemove side chains:\n- CC(=O)N is a side chain on the benzene's nitrogen (NC(C)...). So remove the acetyl (CC(=O)) and the methyl (C) on the N, leaving just N.\n- The F on the pyridine (ncc3F) is a substituent, so remove it.\n- The C attached to the N4 ring (N4CCCC4C) is a substituent, so remove it, leaving N4CCCC4.\n\nSo the scaffold becomes c1ccc(Nc2ccc(OC3CCN(c4nc(N5CCCC5)ncc4)C3)cc1.\n\nWait, but the benzene is c1ccc(OC2...)cc1. The OC2 part is the morpholine. Let me reconstruct:\n\nThe benzene ring is c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1. The morpholine is O-C2-C-C-N connected to the pyridine c3. The pyridine has a N connected to the N4 ring (N4CCCC4). So the final scaffold SMILES would be O=C1CCN(c2nc(N3CCCC3)ncc2)C1 connected to benzene. Wait, no. Let me write the SMILES step by step.\n\nBenzene ring: c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1.\n\nBut in the original SMILES, the benzene is attached to OC2CCN(...). The morpholine ring is O-C2-C-C-N-C2. Wait, the morpholine is O connected to C2, then three Cs and N, which connects back to C2. So the morpholine ring is O-C2-C-C-N-C2, which forms a six-membered ring: O-C-C-C-N-C-O? No, morpholine is a six-membered ring with oxygen and nitrogen. The correct SMILES for morpholine is O1CCCNC1. But in this case, the SMILES is OC2CCN(C2)... So the ring is O-C2-C-C-N connected back to C2, forming a five-membered ring? Wait, OC2CCN(C2) would be O connected to C2, then two Cs, then N connected to C2 again. That forms a five-membered ring: O-C2-C-C-N-C2. That's five atoms: O, C, C, N, C. So that's a five-membered ring, which is not morpholine but rather a different structure. Maybe the original SMILES has a typo here. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is six-membered. Let me count: OC2CCN(C2). The O is connected to C2, then two Cs, then N connected to C2 again. So the ring is O-C-C-C-N-C, which is five atoms. So that's a five-membered ring. But morpholine is six-membered. Hmm, perhaps the original structure is different. Regardless, the Murcko scaffold includes the rings as they are in the input. So the rings here are benzene, the five-membered O-containing ring (O-C-C-C-N-C), the pyridine ring, and the five-membered N-containing ring (N4-C-C-C-C). \n\nSo putting it all together, the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1. However, I need to make sure that the rings are properly closed. Let's check the ring closures. The benzene is c1ccc(...)cc1. The O is connected to C2, which is part of the ring C2CCN(C2). So that's O-C2-C-C-N-C2, forming a five-membered ring. Then the N is connected to c3 (pyridine), which has the structure c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3. The pyridine is c3n...ncc3. Then the N in the pyridine is connected to N4, which is part of the ring N4CCCC4. So N4-C-C-C-C-N4, forming a four-membered ring? Wait, that's four Cs between N4 and N4? No, N4 is connected to C, then three Cs, then back to N4. So that's N4-C-C-C-C-N4, which is a five-membered ring. Wait, N4 connected to four Cs? Let me count: N4-C (1), C (2), C (3), C (4), then back to N4. That's four bonds, forming a five-membered ring? No, that's four atoms between N4 and N4, making a five-membered ring. So N4 is part of a five-membered ring. \n\nSo the final scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1. Let me verify. The benzene (c1ccc...cc1) connected to O-C2CCN(...)C2 (five-membered ring), which connects to the pyridine (c3nc...ncc3). The pyridine's N is connected to N4 in a five-membered ring (N4CCCC4). Yes. So the SMILES should be c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1. But I need to check for any remaining substituents. The original pyridine had an F, which is removed. The N4 had a C attached, which is removed. The benzene had NC(C) which becomes just N. \n\nSo the final answer should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc(OC2CCN(c3nc(N4CCCC4)ncc3)C2)cc1\"}.",

The main structure has a central ring connected to other rings and substituents. Let's break it down.\n\nLooking at the SMILES, there's a six-membered ring (c1ccnc...n1) with a methyl group (Cc1...). The oxygen (Oc2...) connects to another benzene ring (ccccc2) via a single bond. Then there's a -c2ccc(...) part which is another benzene ring. The substituent here is -c3cnc(N)nc3, which is a pyrimidine-like ring with an amino group. Also, there's a fluorine (F) attached.\n\nAccording to the Murcko definition, I need to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. So, the methyl (C), the oxygen-linked benzene (Oc2...), the -c3cnc(N)nc3 group (which is a substituent on the benzene), and the fluorine should be removed. The connecting bonds between the rings are kept.\n\nSo the remaining scaffold should include the central ring connected to the benzene (without the substituents). Wait, the central ring is the six-membered ring with one nitrogen (c1ccnc...n1), then connected via a bond to the benzene (c2ccccc2), which is connected to another benzene (c2ccc...c2). But the substituents on the second benzene are -c3... and F, which should be removed. Also, the oxygen linking the first two rings is part of a side chain, so that bond (O-) is removed.\n\nSo the scaffold would be the central ring fused or connected via single bonds to the other rings without any substituents. Let me reconstruct:\n\nOriginal structure: The central ring is a pyridine (since it's ccnc...n). The O-linked benzene is attached via an ether (O), which is a side chain, so that's removed. The benzene connected via -c- would remain, but the substituents on that benzene (-c3... and F) are removed. Wait, the connecting bond between the central ring and the benzene is part of the scaffold? Or is the benzene considered a side chain?\n\nWait, Murcko scaffold retains the ring systems and the connecting bonds between them. So any bonds that are part of the ring or connecting rings are kept. So if there's a bond between two rings (like a single bond connecting two aromatic rings), that's part of the scaffold. But substituents like -O- groups, methyl, etc., are removed.\n\nSo in the input, the central ring (pyridine-like, c1ccncn1) is connected via an oxygen (Oc2ccccc2...) which is a side chain, so that part is removed. Then there's a benzene ring connected via a single bond (the -c2ccc... part). The substituents on this benzene are -c3... (which is another ring) and F. The -c3... is a pyrimidine ring (c3cnc(N)nc3), which is a separate ring system connected via a single bond. Since it's a substituent on the benzene, it's removed. The fluorine is also a substituent, so removed.\n\nSo the main scaffold would be the central pyridine ring connected via a single bond to the benzene ring (without the substituents). Wait, but the original structure after removing the oxygen-linked benzene would leave the central ring connected to the other benzene. Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nThe SMILES is Cc1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(-c3cnc(N)nc3)c(F)c2)n1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The core is the pyridine ring: c1ccnc(...)n1. The methyl (C) is a substituent, so removed.\n\n- The O is part of a group: Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)c(F)c2. The Oc2... is a benzene ring attached via oxygen (which is a substituent, so removed). The -c2ccc(...) is another benzene connected via a single bond (from the -). The substituents on this benzene are -c3... and F. So the benzene connected via the single bond (without the substituents) would be part of the scaffold? Or is that benzene considered a substituent?\n\nWait, the connecting bonds between rings are kept. So if two rings are connected by a bond (like in biphenyl), that's part of the scaffold. So in the input, after removing the oxygen-linked benzene, there's a benzene connected via a single bond to the central pyridine? Or is that part of the substituent?\n\nWait, the original SMILES is:\n\nThe central ring is c1ccnc(...)n1. Attached to that is O(c2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)c(F)c2). The oxygen is part of a substituent (O-...), which is a side chain. So the entire Oc2... part is a substituent on the central ring. Therefore, removing that substituent would leave the central pyridine ring. But wait, there's another part: the benzene connected via a single bond (the -c2ccc(...) part). Wait, no\u2014the structure is O(c2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)), so the oxygen is connected to a benzene (c2ccccc2), which is connected via a single bond (the hyphen) to another benzene (c2ccc(...)). That's a biphenyl system connected via the oxygen to the central ring. But since the oxygen is part of the substituent, removing that entire group would leave the central pyridine ring. However, perhaps the benzene rings connected via single bonds (without oxygen) are part of the scaffold? Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Murcko scaffold includes all rings connected by bridges or fused rings. Wait, Murcko scaffold is rings and the connecting bonds. So any ring systems connected by a bond (like biphenyl) are kept. But substituents on those rings are removed.\n\nSo in the input, the central ring is a pyridine. Attached to it is an oxygen-linked biphenyl group (O-biphenyl with substituents). The oxygen is a substituent, so removing that entire group. Then, is there any other ring connected directly to the central pyridine? Let me re-examine the SMILES:\n\nThe SMILES is Cc1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(-c3cnc(N)nc3)c(F)c2)n1.\n\nBreaking it down step by step:\n\n1. The core ring is the pyridine: c1ccnc(...)n1. The C is a methyl substituent (removed). The ... is the substituent attached to the nitrogen? Wait, the nitrogen is in position 1 (n1), and the substituent is O... attached to the next carbon in the ring. Wait, the ring is c1ccnc(O...)n1. So the oxygen is attached to the third carbon of the pyridine ring (positions: 1 is n, 2 is c, 3 is c, 4 is n, etc.? Wait, SMILES indexing can be tricky. Let's parse the ring:\n\nThe ring starts with c1, then the next atoms are c, c, n, c. So positions are 1 (c), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (n), 5 (c), and back to 1 via n1? Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, the pyridine ring is arranged as c1 (position 1), then c (2), c (3), n (4), c (5), and back to 1 via n1 (position 6?). Hmm, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The pyridine ring would have nitrogen in one position, and the substituents attached accordingly.\n\nRegardless, the substituent attached via oxygen (Oc2...) is a side chain. So removing that entire substituent (Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)c(F)c2), which includes two benzene rings connected by a single bond and some substituents. Then, the central pyridine ring would have another substituent at position... Let's see: the SMILES is Cc1ccnc(...)n1. The methyl (C) is attached to position 1 (c1). Then positions 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (n), 5 (c) with the oxygen substituent. After removing the oxygen substituent, the pyridine ring remains, but also, is there another substituent on the pyridine? The methyl is removed, so the pyridine would be c1ccncn1. Wait, without the methyl, the SMILES would be c1ccnc(O...)n1 \u2192 after removing the O..., it's c1ccncn1. But wait, the original pyridine has a methyl (Cc1...), so removing that gives c1ccncn1. But wait, the actual structure after removing substituents would be the pyridine ring with no substituents. But wait, maybe there's another ring connected via a bond. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the substituent after the oxygen is Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)c(F)c2. The part after the oxygen is a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) connected via a single bond (the hyphen) to another benzene ring (c2ccc(...)c(F)c2). But since the entire Oc2... is a substituent on the pyridine, removing that would leave the pyridine. However, perhaps the hyphen between the two benzene rings indicates a bond between them, making a biphenyl system. But since that entire biphenyl is attached via an oxygen (which is a substituent), the entire thing is removed. So the scaffold would just be the pyridine ring? But that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing other rings.\n\nWait, there's another part: -c3cnc(N)nc3. That's a ring as well. The substituent -c3cnc(N)nc3 is attached to the benzene ring (the second one in the substituent). But since that's a substituent on a substituent, it's removed. So the only rings in the scaffold would be the pyridine and any rings directly connected via bonds without substituents. But in the original structure, after removing all substituents, are there any other rings connected to the pyridine?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the connecting bonds between rings are kept. For example, if two rings are connected by a single bond (like in biphenyl), that's part of the scaffold. But if a ring is connected via an oxygen (like in diphenyl ether), the oxygen is part of the side chain, so the two benzene rings would not be part of the scaffold.\n\nIn the input SMILES, the central pyridine has an oxygen-linked group. That group includes a benzene connected to another benzene via a single bond. But since the oxygen is part of the side chain, the entire group is removed. Therefore, the scaffold is just the pyridine ring. However, wait, maybe there's another ring connected directly to the pyridine without any heteroatoms or substituents. Let me check again.\n\nThe SMILES is Cc1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(-c3cnc(N)nc3)c(F)c2)n1.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the parentheses. Let's parse the SMILES carefully:\n\nThe main ring is c1 (position 1), followed by c (2), c (3), n (4), c (5), which has a substituent Oc2... The Oc2 part is O connected to c2 (benzene ring: c2ccccc2), then a single bond (-) to c2ccc(...)c(F)c2. Wait, that's another benzene ring (c2ccc(...)c(F)c2) connected via a single bond to the first benzene (c2ccccc2). So the entire Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(...)c(F)c2 is a substituent on the central pyridine's carbon 5.\n\nSo the substituent is a biphenyl ether group (O-biphenyl with substituents). Removing that entire substituent leaves the pyridine ring. Additionally, the methyl group (Cc1) is removed, so the pyridine becomes c1ccncn1. Wait, but in the original SMILES, the pyridine ring is Cc1ccnc(...)n1. Removing the methyl (C) gives c1ccnc(...)n1. Then, removing the substituent (O...) on the carbon adjacent to nitrogen leaves c1ccncn1. So the scaffold would be c1ccncn1. Is that correct?\n\nBut wait, the Murcko scaffold also includes any bridged or fused rings. The pyridine here is a single ring. Are there any other rings connected via bonds that are not part of substituents? In this case, after removing the substituents, no. So the scaffold would be just the pyridine ring. But that seems too minimal. Alternatively, perhaps I missed another ring connected via a bond.\n\nWait, looking back at the substituent: after the oxygen, there's a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) connected via a single bond to another benzene (c2ccc(...)c(F)c2). The hyphen indicates a single bond between the two benzene rings, forming a biphenyl group. However, since this entire structure is attached via an oxygen (which is a substituent), the entire biphenyl group is a side chain and thus removed. Therefore, the scaffold is just the pyridine ring.\n\nBut wait, the Murcko scaffold definition says to leave ring systems and connecting bonds. So if two rings are connected by a bond (like biphenyl), they are part of the scaffold. But in this case, the biphenyl is attached via an oxygen, which is a substituent. So the oxygen is part of the side chain, so the biphenyl is removed. Hence, the scaffold is the pyridine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the connecting bond between the pyridine and the benzene via oxygen is not considered a connecting bond for the scaffold. Only bonds that are between rings without any heteroatoms or substituents. So the oxygen is a heteroatom in the side chain, so the benzene rings attached via oxygen are not part of the scaffold.\n\nTherefore, the final scaffold is the pyridine ring without any substituents. The SMILES would be c1ccncn1. Let me verify this. The original pyridine had a methyl and the oxygen substituent. Removing those gives c1ccncn1. Yes.\n\nBut wait, the input SMILES has \"n1\" at the end, which closes the ring. So the pyridine is six-membered: positions 1 (c), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (n), 5 (c), and back to 1 via n1. Wait, that might not form a six-membered ring. Let me count: the ring is c1 followed by c, c, n, c, and back to n1. That's five atoms? Wait, no: c1 (1), then c (2), c (3), n (4), c (5), then the closing bond is to n1 (position 1). Wait, that would make a five-membered ring? That can't be right. Oh, perhaps I'm misparsing the SMILES.\n\nWait, the SMILES is Cc1ccnc(Oc2ccccc2-c2ccc(-c3cnc(N)nc3)c(F)c2)n1.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Cc1: methyl attached to atom 1 (carbon).\n- Then cc: atoms 2 and 3 are carbons.\n- nc(O...): atom 4 is nitrogen, atom 5 is carbon with substituent O...\n- )n1: closing the ring back to atom 1 via the nitrogen (n1).\n\nSo the ring is 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (N), 5 (C), and back to 1 (N). Wait, that would be a five-membered ring? That's impossible because a five-membered ring with two nitrogens (positions 4 and 1) would be something else. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me visualize:\n\nThe ring starts with C1 (atom 1, carbon with methyl), then C2 (atom 2, carbon), C3 (atom 3, carbon), N4 (atom 4, nitrogen), C5 (atom 5, carbon), and then back to N1 (atom 1 via the nitrogen). That would form a five-membered ring: C1-C2-C3-N4-C5-N1. But that's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens, which is possible (like imidazole), but the original SMILES might have a different structure. However, this seems incorrect because the original molecule likely has a six-membered ring. Maybe I'm parsing the SMILES incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, the ring is six-membered. Let me try again. The SMILES is Cc1ccnc(...)n1. The indices go from 1 to 5, then back to 1. Wait, SMILES uses the numbers to indicate ring closures. So c1 is the first atom. Then, after five atoms (c, c, n, c, and then n1), forming a six-membered ring? Wait, no. Let's count:\n\nAtom 1: c (with methyl)\nAtom 2: c\nAtom 3: c\nAtom 4: n\nAtom 5: c (with substituent O...)\nAtom 6: n (from n1)\n\nSo the ring is 1-2-3-4-5-6-1, forming a six-membered ring. But in the SMILES string, the closure is n1, meaning the sixth atom (n) connects back to atom 1. So the ring is six-membered: positions 1 (c), 2 (c), 3 (c), 4 (n), 5 (c), 6 (n), and back to 1. That forms a six-membered ring with two nitrogens: positions 4 and 6. That makes sense as a diazine, perhaps.\n\nIn any case, the key is that the scaffold is the six-membered ring with the nitrogens, after removing all substituents. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(nc1)n1, but I need to get the correct arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, the correct SMILES for the scaffold would be c1cnccc1n. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to generate the SMILES without substituents.\n\nOriginal ring after removing substituents: the ring is c1 followed by c, c, n, c, n, and closing with n1. So the SMILES would be c1ccncn1. Yes, that's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens at positions 4 and 6. For example, pyridazine is c1ccncc1, but this would be c1ccncn1, which is 1,3-diazine? Not sure, but the exact arrangement might not matter as long as it's the correct ring.\n\nSo the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccncn1. But let me confirm. If we remove all substituents (methyl, the O-linked groups, etc.), the remaining ring is the central six-membered ring with two nitrogens. So the SMILES is c1ccncn1.\n\nBut wait, the original SMILES has \"n1\" at the end, which is the nitrogen closing the ring. So the scaffold would be c1ccncn1. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the JSON output should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccncn1\"}.",

The input is CCc1ccccc1NC(=O)Cn1nc(CC)n2c(cc3sccc32)c1=O.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the SMILES to understand the structure. The molecule has a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to an NC(=O) group. Then there's a chain with Cn1nc... which seems like a ring system. Let me break it down.\n\nThe Murcko scaffold requires keeping only the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So, I should remove any side chains and functional groups. The benzene ring is part of the scaffold. Then, looking at the other parts: the NC(=O) group is a substituent on the benzene, so that gets removed. The part after that is a bit tricky. The 'Cn1nc...' part has a ring with n1, n2, and possibly other rings connected.\n\nWait, the part after the C in NC(=O)C is a nitrogen-containing ring. Let me visualize it. The 'n1nc(CC)' suggests a ring with two nitrogens. Then there's another ring with 'n2c(cc3sccc32)c1=O'. The 'sccc3' indicates a thiophene ring (sulfur in a five-membered ring). So, the rings here are the benzene, the bicyclic system connecting n1, n2, and the thiophene.\n\nBut the substituents like the CC (ethyl) on the nc(CC) and the =O group on c1=O should be removed. Also, the side chains like the ethyl (CCc...) attached to the benzene and the amide group (NC(=O)) are side chains. So stripping those off.\n\nSo the core rings would be the benzene connected via a single bond (from the original structure) to the bicyclic system that includes the thiophene. The connecting bonds between the rings are kept. Any substituents like ethyl, amide groups, and the ketone oxygen (from the c1=O) are removed. The thiophene (sccc3) is part of the ring system, so it stays. The connecting bonds between the rings are the single bonds that link the benzene to the bicyclic structure and the bonds within the bicyclic system itself.\n\nPutting it all together, the scaffold should have the benzene ring connected to the bicyclic system which includes the thiophene. The SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)Cn1nc2c(c3sccc3)n2c1. Let me check: the benzene is c1ccccc1, connected via a single bond to the C in Cn1... The n1 is part of a ring: n1nc2... The c2 is connected to a thiophene (c3sccc3). The exact arrangement needs to form the rings correctly. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc(cc1)Cn1ncc2c1c3sccc3c2. Wait, perhaps I need to ensure the ring closures are properly numbered. Alternatively, the core might be c1ccc(cc1)Cn2c3nc(n2)c2sccc3c2. Hmm, maybe I should draw it step by step.\n\nOriginal structure after removing substituents: the benzene (c1ccccc1) connected to a CH2 (from the original C in NC(=O)C, but after removing the amide, it's just a CH2). Then the CH2 is connected to a nitrogen in a ring. The rings are n1 and n2. Let me re-express the core without substituents. The part after the CH2 is n1nc... The original part is Cn1nc(CC)n2c(cc3sccc32)c1=O. Removing substituents: the (CC) on nc and the =O on c1. So the core becomes Cn1ncn2c(cc3sccc3)c2n1. Wait, but the actual rings would be formed by the closure. Let me reconstruct:\n\nThe main rings are the benzene, then the CH2 connected to a ring with two nitrogens and a thiophene. The thiophene (sccc3) is fused to another ring. So the scaffold SMILES should be c1ccc(cc1)Cn2c3nc(n2)c2sccc3c2. Let me check the ring closures. The benzene is c1ccc(cc1), then CH2 (C) connected to n2. The n2 is part of a ring: n2c3nc... Then nc(n2) would imply a ring closure between n2 and the other nitrogen. The thiophene is c2sccc3c2, but I might have to adjust the numbering. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc(cc1)Cn2c3nc(n2)c2sccc3c2. That seems to form the bicyclic system with the thiophene. Let me verify the connectivity. The n2 is connected to the CH2 from benzene, then to c3 which is connected to another nitrogen (nc...), forming a ring. The c3 is also connected to the thiophene ring (c2sccc3c2). Hmm, perhaps another way to write this would be c1ccc(cc1)Cn2c3c(nc4n2ccs4)cc3. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the scaffold is benzene connected to a bicyclic system consisting of a pyrimidine-like ring fused to a thiophene. The correct SMILES would require proper ring numbering. Let me think again. The original SMILES after removing substituents should retain the rings and connecting bonds. So the benzene is c1ccccc1, connected to a CH2 (C), then to a nitrogen in a ring. The rings after that are a bicyclic system where one ring has two nitrogens and is fused to the thiophene. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)Cn2c(cc3sccc23)n2. Wait, that might not close properly. Alternatively, maybe c1ccc(cc1)Cn2c3c(cc4sccc34)ncn2. Testing this in a SMILES parser would help, but since I can't do that, I'll have to go with the most plausible structure. Considering the original input, the core should have the benzene linked to a bicyclic system with the thiophene. The correct Murcko scaffold is likely c1ccc(cc1)Cn2c(c3sccc3)c3nc(n2)c3.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is CC(NC(=O)Nc1cc2[nH]nc(NC(C)c3ccccn3)c2cn1)c1ccccc1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the rings. Looking at the structure, there's a central ring connected to another ring via a bond. Let me parse the SMILES step by step. The part 'c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1' suggests a bicyclic system\u2014maybe a five-membered ring fused with a six-membered ring? The other part 'c3ccccn3' is a pyridine ring since it's a six-membered ring with one nitrogen. The main structure also has substituents like the amide groups (NC(=O)N...) and the ethyl groups (CC...).\n\nAccording to the Murcko definition, I need to remove all side chains and functional groups. So, any atoms not part of the ring systems or the connecting bonds should be stripped. The central bicyclic system (the two fused rings) and the pyridine ring connected via a bond would form the scaffold. Wait, the pyridine ring is connected through a nitrogen? Let me check the connectivity. The part 'NC(C)c3ccccn3' indicates a nitrogen connected to a carbon (from the CC), which is part of the pyridine. But the Murcko scaffold should retain the connecting bonds between rings. So, the NC(C) is a substituent on the pyridine, so that should be removed. Similarly, the amide groups (NC(=O)N...) are side chains off the central ring. Removing those, the scaffold would be the central bicyclic system connected to the pyridine ring via a single bond. Let me visualize: the central bicyclic has two rings fused, and the pyridine is attached via a single bond. Then, the connecting bond between the two ring systems is retained. Any exocyclic double bonds? The amide has a carbonyl, which is exocyclic, so that's removed. The final scaffold SMILES would be the two fused rings (from the central part) connected to the pyridine. Let me write that. The central part is c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1, and the pyridine is c3ccccn3. The connecting bond is between the central ring's nitrogen and the pyridine's carbon? Wait, the original SMILES has NC(C)c3ccccn3, so the nitrogen in the central ring connects to a carbon (from CC), which connects to the pyridine. But in the scaffold, the side chains are removed, so that connecting carbon (from CC) would be stripped. Therefore, the pyridine is connected directly via a bond to the central bicyclic system. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The original structure: the central bicyclic ring has a nitrogen (from NC(=O)N...) which connects to the pyridine via a chain. But that chain (like the C(C) part) is a side chain, so it's removed. So, the scaffold would have the central bicyclic ring and the pyridine ring connected by a single bond. Wait, but how? If the connecting chain is removed, maybe the two rings are not connected. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-express the original molecule. The main part is the central bicyclic ring (rings 1 and 2 fused), then there's a substituent on that ring which is an amide group (NC(=O)N...), which connects to another nitrogen that's part of the pyridine ring. But the NC(=O)N is a side chain, so removing that would disconnect the pyridine from the central ring. Wait, no. Let me parse the SMILES again. The SMILES is CC(...) which is a branch. The main chain starts with CC, then connected to NC(=O)Nc1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1. The 'c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1' is the central bicyclic ring. The part inside the nc(...) is NC(C)c3ccccn3. So the nitrogen in the central ring is connected to a carbon (from C(C)), which is connected to the pyridine. So the chain is N-C(C)-c3ccccn3. The C(C) here is a methyl group attached to the nitrogen, which is part of the side chain. So in the Murcko scaffold, that entire side chain (N-C(C)-) is removed, leaving the pyridine disconnected. Wait, but maybe the pyridine is part of the scaffold if it's connected via a bond that's not a side chain. Wait, perhaps the connecting bond between the central ring and the pyridine is part of the scaffold. Alternatively, perhaps the pyridine is a separate ring system connected via a linker. But according to the definition, the scaffold includes ring systems and the connecting bonds between them. So any atoms that are part of the linker between two rings are retained. Let me check the original structure. The central bicyclic ring has a substituent that is a nitrogen connected to a carbon (from C(C)), which is connected to the pyridine. So the path is central ring's N connected to C(C) connected to pyridine's N? Wait, no. The SMILES for that part is NC(C)c3ccccn3. So the nitrogen (from NC(C)) is attached to the central ring, then the C(C) is a methyl group attached to that nitrogen, and the pyridine is attached via the carbon (the 'c3ccccn3' part). Wait, no. The 'c3ccccn3' is the pyridine ring. So the NC(C) is a substituent on the pyridine? Wait, the SMILES is nc(NC(C)c3ccccn3). So the 'nc(...)' part: the nitrogen is part of the central bicyclic ring, and the 'C(...)' is attached to that nitrogen. The 'C(...)' is NC(C)c3ccccn3. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me break it down. The central bicyclic ring has a nitrogen (from [nH]nc(...)), which is connected to a carbon (the 'c' in nc(...)), which is part of the central ring. Then, that nitrogen (the one in 'nc(...)') is connected to a NC(C)c3ccccn3 group. So the structure is N-C(C)-c3ccccn3. The C(C) here is a methyl group (from CC) attached to the nitrogen. So the entire NC(C) is a side chain, which connects to the pyridine. Therefore, in the Murcko scaffold, the side chains like NC(C) are removed. Therefore, the pyridine ring is a substituent via that side chain and should be removed. Wait, but if the pyridine is connected via a single bond that's part of the linker between rings, then it would stay. But in this case, the pyridine is connected through a side chain (the NC(C)), which is not part of a ring. So removing that side chain would disconnect the pyridine. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would only include the central bicyclic ring. Wait, but maybe I'm missing a connecting bond. Let me look again. The central bicyclic system is c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1. The 'nc(...)' part: the nitrogen is part of the ring? The central ring has a nitrogen in the ring (the [nH] part) and another nitrogen in the nc(...) part. Let me draw this. The central structure is a bicyclic system: perhaps a five-membered ring fused to a six-membered ring. The five-membered ring has two nitrogens (the [nH] and the nc(...) part). The six-membered ring is the c1cc2...c2cn1 part. Hmm, maybe it's a benzimidazole-like structure. But regardless, the key is to retain the rings and connecting bonds. The substituents like the amide groups (NC(=O)N) and the NC(C) connected to the pyridine are side chains. Removing all those, the scaffold should be the central bicyclic ring. Wait, but the original input also has a benzene ring attached to the CC at the beginning: CC(...)c1ccccc1. That benzene is a substituent on the central carbon (the first C in CC), so that's a side chain and should be removed. So the final scaffold would be the central bicyclic ring system, which includes the two fused rings. Let me try to write the SMILES for that. The central part is c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. Wait, let's parse that. The SMILES part is c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1. The 'c1' starts a ring. Then cc2: two carbons, then a ring closure to position 2. The [nH] is a nitrogen in the ring with a hydrogen. Then nc(...) would be a nitrogen connected to a carbon (which is part of the ring), then another part. But when we remove the substituents, the 'nc(...)' becomes just 'n', because the 'C(...)' is a substituent. Wait, no. If the nitrogen is part of the ring, then the connecting bonds are part of the ring. Let me try to reconstruct the scaffold. The original SMILES for the central part is c1cc2[nH]nc(NC(C)c3ccccn3)c2cn1. Removing the substituents (the NC(C)c3ccccn3 part attached to the nitrogen), the scaffold would be c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. Because the 'nc(...)' becomes 'nc' but without the substituent. Wait, but the nitrogen in 'nc' is part of the ring? Let me count the atoms. Starting with c1 (position 1), then c (position 2), c (position 3), then [nH] (position 4), n (position 5), c (position 6) connected to substituent, then back to c2 (position 7?), maybe. This is getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, maybe the central scaffold is a fused ring system: a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. The six-membered ring would be the benzene part, and the five-membered ring includes the two nitrogens. But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: use a SMILES parser to break down the structure. However, since I can't do that, I need to proceed carefully. The key is to remove all substituents, leaving only the rings and the connecting bonds. The central bicyclic system is the main part. The benzene ring attached via CC is a substituent and is removed. The pyridine connected via NC(C) is also a substituent and removed. The amide group (NC(=O)N) is another substituent. So the final scaffold is the central bicyclic ring, which in SMILES would be c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. Let me check the connectivity. The SMILES c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1: starting at c1, then c (2), c (3), [nH] (4), n (5), c (6), then closing the second ring with c2 (which connects back to position 3). Then c (7), n (8), back to c1. This forms a bicyclic system: a six-membered ring (positions 1,2,3,7,8, and back to 1) and a five-membered ring (positions 3,4,5,6,7). That makes sense. The nitrogens are in the five-membered ring. So the Murcko scaffold should be this bicyclic system, resulting in the SMILES c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1.",

The input SMILES is CC1CN(c2c(F)cc3c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C4CC4)c3c2Cl)CCN1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the ring systems. The main structure has a central nitrogen connected to two carbon chains (CCN1 and CC1), but those are part of the rings? Let me parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nLooking at the SMILES, there's a 1CN...CCN1 part, which forms a six-membered ring (1 is the position marker). Then there's a c2c(F)cc3...c3c2Cl part. The 'c' denotes aromatic carbons. So, the c2...c2Cl is a benzene ring with Cl and F substituents. Then the cc3...c3 part suggests another ring attached here. The 'c(=O)' and other groups might be substituents.\n\nWait, the benzene ring (c2) connects to a third ring via cc3. Let me check: c2c(F)cc3... So, the benzene (c2) has a fluorine, then two carbons leading to c3. The c3 is part of another ring? The part c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C4CC4)c3 suggests that after the carbonyl groups, there's a 'n' (nitrogen) connected to C4CC4, which is a cyclopropane ring (C4CC4 forms a three-membered ring). But the nitrogen here is part of a ring? The 'cn(C4CC4)c3' part: the 'n' is connected to the cyclopropane and the c3. So, maybe the nitrogen is part of a ring? Let's see: the path is c3...n...c3? If the nitrogen is between two carbons that are part of the same ring, then it forms a ring. Let me map the atoms:\n\nStarting from c3: the sequence is c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C4CC4)c3. The 'c3' at the end connects back to the 'c' in 'cn', forming a five-membered ring? Let's see: c3 is connected to the 'n', which is connected to another 'c' (from 'cn'), which is connected back to c3. That would form a five-membered ring: c3 connected to n, then to c, then to C(=O)O, then to c(=O), then back to c3. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the c3 is part of a ring with the nitrogen. Let me count bonds. The 'c3' is connected via single bonds: c3=O, then c (with substituents), then n, then c3 again. That would form a five-membered ring: c3 (with =O), then another carbon, then the nitrogen, then back to c3. But that would be a three-membered ring, which is unlikely. Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the main rings are the benzene (c2c...c2Cl), and the central piperazine-like ring (CC1CN...CCN1). Then, there's a third ring formed by the c3 and the nitrogen. Wait, the part after the benzene: cc3c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C4CC4)c3. The 'cc3' implies that the benzene's carbon connects to another carbon which is part of ring 3. Then the c3 is part of a ring. Let's see: c3 is connected to c(=O), then to c(C(=O)O), then to n, then to C4 (cyclopropane?), then back to c3. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the c3 is part of a ring with the nitrogen. Let's try to draw this mentally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are three rings here: the benzene ring (c2), the central six-membered ring (1CN...CCN1), and a third ring involving the nitrogen connected to the cyclopropane. But the cyclopropane (C4CC4) is a separate ring. So the main scaffold would include the benzene ring, the central six-membered ring (piperazine-like), and any connecting bonds. The substituents like F, Cl, the carbonyl groups, the carboxylic acid (C(=O)O), and the cyclopropane (C4CC4) would all be removed as side chains or functional groups.\n\nSo, the Murcko scaffold should retain the rings and the connecting bonds. Let me try to strip away the substituents. The benzene ring (c2) has F and Cl attached; those are substituents, so remove them. The central ring is 1CN...CCN1, which is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. The connecting bonds between the rings: the central nitrogen (N) in the six-membered ring is connected to the benzene (c2). Then, the benzene is connected via a single bond to the next ring? Wait, the SMILES is CC1CN(c2c(F)cc3c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C4CC4)c3c2Cl)CCN1. The central N is connected to the benzene ring (c2...c2Cl). Then, within the benzene, there's a connection to the third ring (cc3...c3). The third ring would be the part starting with cc3: c(=O)c(...)cn(...)c3. So, the c3 is part of another ring. Let me see: the path from c3 is c(=O) - c(...) - n(...) - c3. That forms a five-membered ring? If c3 is connected via four atoms back to itself, that's a five-membered ring. So, the third ring is a five-membered ring with the nitrogen. So the scaffold would have three rings: the central piperazine-like ring, the benzene ring, and the five-membered ring with nitrogen, all connected via single bonds? Or are they fused?\n\nWait, the central N is connected to the benzene (c2), which is connected via a chain (cc3) to the five-membered ring. Then, the five-membered ring (c3, c, n, C4CC4?) No, the C4CC4 is a cyclopropane substituent on the nitrogen. So the five-membered ring would be c3 connected to the nitrogen, which is connected to another carbon (from the central ring?), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nThe key is to remove all substituents. So, for each ring, remove any atoms that are not part of the ring or connecting bonds. So, the benzene ring (c2) would lose the F and Cl. The central six-membered ring (1CN...CCN1) is already a ring. The third ring (c3 and the nitrogen) would need to be part of the scaffold if it's a ring system connected via a bond. The connecting bonds are the ones that link the rings together. So, the central N is part of the six-membered ring and connected to the benzene. The benzene is connected to the five-membered ring via a single bond (cc3). Then, the five-membered ring (if it's a ring) would be part of the scaffold.\n\nBut wait, in the input SMILES, after the benzene (c2), there's cc3c(=O)... So the 'cc3' suggests that two carbons are between the benzene and the c3. But since we're removing side chains, those two carbons (the 'cc') might be part of a connecting chain, so they should be removed? Or are they part of a ring?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the benzene is connected via a single bond to another ring (the five-membered one). So, the Murcko scaffold would include the benzene, the central six-membered ring, and the five-membered ring, connected by the bonds between them. The substituents like F, Cl, the carbonyl groups, the carboxylic acid, and the cyclopropane would all be stripped.\n\nSo, the original structure has three rings connected by bonds. The Murcko scaffold would retain those three rings and the connecting bonds. Let's try to write that as SMILES.\n\nThe central six-membered ring is CC1CN(...)CCN1. Removing substituents, it becomes C1CCNCCN1? Wait, the original is CC1CN(...)CCN1. So the ring is 1-C-N connected to the benzene, then C-C-N. So the ring atoms are C1, C, N, C, C, N. So the six-membered ring is C1 connected to C, then N, then the benzene substituent (but that's a substituent?), then C, C, N, and back to C1. Wait, maybe the central ring is a piperazine-like structure: the SMILES is CC1CN(...)CCN1. So the ring is C1-C-N-C-C-N-C1, forming a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. So the SMILES for this ring would be C1CNCCCN1? Not sure. Let's see: the actual ring is C1 (connected to C), then C connected to N, then N connected to the benzene, then C, C, N, and back to C1. So the ring is C-C-N-C-C-N, connected in a cycle. The SMILES would be C1CNCCN1. Because the ring closure is between the first C (C1) and the last N (connected back to C1). So the central ring is C1-C-N-C-C-N-C1, which is a six-membered ring with two nitrogens.\n\nThen, the benzene ring (c2c...c2Cl) becomes c1ccc(cc1) after removing F and Cl. But it's connected to the central ring via the N. Then, the benzene is connected via a chain to the five-membered ring. Wait, the benzene has a 'cc3' part, which is two carbons leading to the third ring (c3). But those two carbons are part of a chain, so they should be removed in the scaffold. So the benzene should be directly connected to the third ring? Or is the third ring part of the benzene's substituent?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the five-membered ring is fused to the benzene. But the SMILES doesn't indicate fusion (using lower case letters without numbers). The 'cc3' suggests that after the benzene's carbon (c2), there are two carbons (c and c3), but that might be a chain. Since Murcko scaffold removes side chains, those two carbons would be removed, leaving the benzene connected directly to the third ring (c3). Wait, but that's not possible unless there's a direct bond. Let me re-examine the SMILES: the part after the benzene is c2c(F)cc3c(=O)... So the benzene (c2) has a fluorine (F), then a carbon (c), another carbon (c3). The 'cc3' implies that the benzene's carbon (c2) is connected to a carbon (c), which is connected to c3. The c3 is part of another ring. But in the scaffold, we need to remove side chains, so the 'c' (the one between c2 and c3) would be a chain and thus removed. Therefore, the benzene would be directly connected to c3, but that's not the case in the original structure. This is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third ring (c3) is connected via a single bond to the benzene, so in the scaffold, that bond remains. So the Murcko scaffold would have the benzene connected via a single bond to the five-membered ring (c3). Then, the five-membered ring would be part of the scaffold. But in the original SMILES, the five-membered ring (if it exists) has substituents like =O and the cyclopropane. Those would be removed.\n\nSo putting it all together, the Murcko scaffold would be the central six-membered ring (C1CNCCN1) connected to the benzene (c1ccc(cc1)), and the benzene connected to the five-membered ring (c2ccc(n2)). But I'm not sure about the exact structure of the five-membered ring.\n\nWait, the part after the benzene is cc3c(=O)c(C(=O)O)cn(C4CC4)c3. Removing substituents, the c(=O) becomes c, the C(=O)O becomes C, and the cyclopropane (C4CC4) is removed. The nitrogen (n) would remain part of the ring. So the five-membered ring would be c3 connected to c, then to n, then to c3, forming a three-membered ring? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the path is c3 connected to c (from c(=O)), then to c (from C(=O)O), then to n, then to c3. That would form a four-membered ring, which is possible. But that's not likely. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, the five-membered ring is formed by the atoms c3, c (from c(=O)), c (from C(=O)O), n, and another c connected back to c3. Let's count: c3 - c - c - n - c (from the central ring?), but I'm not sure. This part is tricky without drawing it.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to use a tool or library to extract the Murcko scaffold. But since I'm doing this manually, I need to focus on the rings. The main rings are the benzene (c2...c2), the central six-membered ring (C1...N1), and the five-membered ring involving the nitrogen connected to c3. All other groups are substituents and should be removed.\n\nSo, stripping all substituents:\n\n- Benzene: remove F and Cl, leaving c1ccc(cc1).\n- Central ring: C1CNCCN1.\n- Five-membered ring: starting from c3, remove the =O, C(=O)O, and cyclopropane. So the ring would be c3 connected to c, connected to n, connected back to c3? That would be a three-membered ring, which is unlikely. Maybe the five-membered ring includes the nitrogen from the central ring. Wait, the nitrogen in the central ring is connected to the benzene, which is connected via a chain to the five-membered ring. But that chain is a side chain and should be removed. Therefore, perhaps the five-membered ring is not part of the scaffold, and only the benzene and the central ring are retained.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the five-membered ring is part of the scaffold. Let's try to reconstruct. The original SMILES has c3 connected to c(=O), then to c(C(=O)O), then to n, then to C4CC4 (cyclopropane), then back to c3. If we remove the substituents (=O, C(=O)O, cyclopropane), the remaining atoms would be c3 connected to c, connected to c, connected to n, connected to c3. That would form a five-membered ring? Wait, c3 - c - c - n - c3. That's four bonds, forming a five-membered ring (since it's cyclic). Wait, no: the atoms are c3, c, c, n, and then back to c3. That's four atoms, which would form a four-membered ring. But that's possible. However, four-membered rings are less common but can exist. Alternatively, maybe I missed a connection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the nitrogen in the five-membered ring is part of another ring. But I'm getting stuck here.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to identify all rings in the molecule and connect them via their bridging bonds. The input molecule has a central piperazine-like ring (six-membered with two nitrogens), a benzene ring connected to one of the nitrogens, and another ring (possibly the five-membered one) connected to the benzene. The substituents like F, Cl, carbonyls, and cyclopropane are removed.\n\nSo, the Murcko scaffold would consist of the piperazine ring connected to the benzene ring, which in turn is connected to the five-membered ring. The connecting bonds are preserved, and all substituents are stripped.\n\nTherefore, the SMILES would be something like C1CNc2ccc3cccn3c2CCN1. But I need to ensure that the rings are correctly represented. The benzene (c2ccc(cc2)) connected to the piperazine (C1CN...CCN1), and the benzene connected to the five-membered ring (c3ccc(n3)).\n\nAlternatively, after removing substituents, the SMILES might be C1CNc2ccc3cnccc3c2CCN1. But without the exact structure, it's hard to be precise. However, considering the standard Murcko scaffold extraction, the correct answer would retain the ring systems and connecting bonds. The key is to remove all functional groups and side chains, leaving only the rings and the bonds that link them together.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Murcko scaffold should include the piperazine ring, the benzene ring, and the five-membered ring connected via the appropriate bonds, with all substituents removed.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is CC(=O)NCC1CN(c2ccc(C(C)=NO)cc2)C(=O)O1. First, I need to identify the ring systems and the connecting bonds.\n\nLooking at the structure, there's a six-membered ring (maybe benzene) connected to another ring. Let me parse the SMILES. The main part is the O1 connected to C1, which is part of a ring. Then there's a c2 benzene ring with substituents. The benzene ring (c2ccc(...)cc2) is part of the core. The substituent on the benzene is C(C)=NO, which is a side chain. So that should be removed.\n\nThe other ring is the O1-containing ring. The main scaffold would include the benzene ring connected via a bond to the oxygen-containing ring. The connecting bond is between the N in NCC1 and the benzene's nitrogen? Wait, the SMILES is CC(=O)NCC1CN(c2ccc(...)cc2)C(=O)O1. The N in the middle (CN) is attached to the benzene ring via the c2 group. So the rings are the benzene (c2) and the O1 ring (O1 is part of a five-membered ring: C1 is connected to N, then C, then O1, etc. Wait, the O1 is part of a ring closure: C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1, making a five-membered ring? So the rings are the benzene and the five-membered ring (which is an oxazolidinone or similar). \n\nThen, the connecting bond between them is the bond from the N in the five-membered ring to the benzene. So the Murcko scaffold should be the two rings connected by that single bond. All other substituents like the acetyl group (CC(=O)N), the C(C)=NO on the benzene, and the C(=O)O1 (which is part of the ring) would be removed. Wait, but the C(=O)O1 is part of the ring structure, so maybe that stays. Wait, the Murcko scaffold definition says to leave ring systems and connecting bonds. So the rings are the benzene and the five-membered ring (which includes the C(=O)O1 as part of the ring). So the rings themselves are kept, and any side chains are removed. The benzene has a substituent C(C)=NO, which is a side chain, so remove that. The other parts: the CC(=O)N attached to the five-membered ring via the NCC1 part. So the NCC1 would be part of the connecting chain? Wait, the Murcko scaffold includes the ring systems and the connecting bonds. The connecting bonds are the bonds between rings. So in this case, the five-membered ring is connected to the benzene via a single bond from the N in the five-membered ring to the benzene. So the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via that bond to the five-membered ring. All other substituents on these rings (like the C(C)=NO on the benzene and the acetyl group on the five-membered ring's nitrogen) are side chains and should be removed. \n\nSo the final scaffold should be the benzene ring (c1ccc(cc1) connected to the five-membered ring. The five-membered ring's structure is C1CNC(=O)O1. Wait, the original structure for the five-membered ring is C1CN(C(...))C(=O)O1. When we remove the substituents, the N in the five-membered ring is connected only to the benzene and the other atoms in the ring. So the five-membered ring would be C1CNC(=O)O1. So combining them, the Murcko scaffold would be c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC2=O? Wait, let me check. The benzene is connected to the N which is part of the five-membered ring. The five-membered ring is N-C-C-O-C(=O)-, forming a ring. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Wait, maybe O1 is part of the ring closure. Let me reconstruct. The original part is NCC1CN(...)C(=O)O1. So the ring is C1 connected to N, then C, then N (from the benzene), then C(=O)O1. So the ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. Wait, that's a five-membered ring: C1 (connected to N), then C, then N (connected to benzene), then C(=O), then O connected back to C1. So the five-membered ring is O1-C(=O)-N-C-C1, forming a ring. So the SMILES for that ring would be O1C(=O)NCC1. But the actual order might be different. Let me write it properly. The ring closure is at C1 and O1. The five-membered ring is C1 connected to N (from NCC1), then that N is connected to C, which is connected to the N attached to benzene, then that N is connected to C(=O)O1. So the ring is C1-N-C-N-C(=O)-O1. Wait, that's six members? Wait, C1 (position 1) connected to N (position 2), then C (position 3), then N (position 4), then C(=O) (position 5), then O (position 6) connected back to C1? No, that would be six atoms. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me count again. The original SMILES part is C1CN(...)C(=O)O1. So the ring is C1 connected to C, then N, then the benzene's N, then C(=O)O1. Wait, perhaps the ring is C1-C-N(...)-C(=O)-O1. That's four atoms? No, C1 (1), C (2), N (3), C(=O) (4), O1 (5), forming a five-membered ring. So the ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. So the SMILES for the ring would be C1CNC(=O)O1. But the actual connectivity might have the N connected to the benzene. So the Murcko scaffold would be the benzene ring connected to the five-membered ring via the N. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Wait, but the five-membered ring is O1 connected to C1, which is connected to C, which is connected to N, which is connected to C(=O), which connects back to O1. So the ring is O1-C(=O)-N-C-C1. So SMILES would be O1C(=O)NCC1. But the order might be different. Alternatively, using numbers: C1 is connected to C, then N, then C(=O), then O1, forming the ring. So the five-membered ring is C1CNC(=O)O1. So combining with the benzene, the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Let me check with a structure drawing. Benzene ring (c1ccc(cc1)) connected to N, which is part of a five-membered ring: N-C-C-O-C(=O)- (with the O connected back to the first C). Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC(=O)C2. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Alternatively, the five-membered ring is O1C(=O)NCC1. So the scaffold would be c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. That seems plausible. Let me verify. The benzene (c1ccc(cc1)) is connected to an N, which is part of a ring: N2 connected to C, then C, then O, then C(=O), then back to N2. Wait, no, the ring would be N2-C-C-O-C(=O)-N2? No, that's a five-membered ring. Wait, maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Let me write that: the benzene connected to N2, which is connected to C, then C(=O), then O, then back to N2. That forms a five-membered ring: N-C-C(=O)-O-N. But that's four members? Wait, N2-C-C(=O)-O-C2 (if the closure is between O and N2). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write it step by step. The five-membered ring in the original molecule is part of the structure C1CN(c2ccc(...)cc2)C(=O)O1. So C1 is connected to C, which is connected to N (which is connected to the benzene), then to C(=O), then to O1, which closes the ring back to C1. So the ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. That's five atoms: C1, C, N, C(=O), O1. So the ring is a five-membered ring with atoms C-C-N-C-O. The SMILES for this ring would be C1CNC(=O)O1. So when we remove the side chains, the benzene is connected to the N in this ring. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold is the benzene ring connected via a single bond to the N in the five-membered ring. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Wait, the five-membered ring is N2 connected to C, C, O, and C(=O), forming the ring. So the SMILES for the five-membered ring would be O1C(=O)NCC1. But when combined with the benzene, it's c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Let me check this. The benzene (c1ccc(cc1)) is connected to N2. Then N2 is connected to C3, which is connected to C4, which is connected to O5, which is connected to C(=O)6, which is connected back to N2. Wait, that's not correct. Alternatively, the ring is N2-C3-C4-O5-C(=O)6, but how does the closure happen? Maybe the correct way is to have the ring as O1C(=O)NCC1. So the five-membered ring is O1-C(=O)-N-C-C1. So when combined with the benzene, the SMILES is c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC(=O)C2. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to use a different notation. Let me think of the five-membered ring as starting with N connected to the benzene. Then, the N is part of a ring: N-C-C-O-C(=O)-N. Wait, that's five atoms: N, C, C, O, C(=O), but the closure would be between the N and the O? No, in the original structure, the ring closure is between C1 and O1. So the ring is C1 connected to C, which is connected to N, which is connected to C(=O), which is connected to O1, which connects back to C1. So the ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. Therefore, the SMILES for this ring is C1CNC(=O)O1. So the scaffold would be the benzene connected to the N in this ring. So the SMILES is c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC(=O)C2. Wait, no, because the ring is C1CNC(=O)O1, so the N is part of the ring. When connected to the benzene, it's c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC(=O)C2. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Let's try that. The benzene (c1ccc(cc1)) connected to N2. Then N2 is connected to C3, which is connected to C4, which is connected to O5, which is connected to C6(=O), which is connected back to N2. So the ring is N2-C3-C4-O5-C6(=O)-N2. That's a five-membered ring. The SMILES would be N2CCOC(=O)C2. So combining with the benzene, it's c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC(=O)C2. But the original ring is C1-C-N-C(=O)-O1. So maybe the correct SMILES is C1CNC(=O)O1. So when connected to the benzene, it's c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Wait, no. Let's try to write the SMILES properly. The five-membered ring is C1 connected to C, then N, then C(=O), then O1. So the SMILES for the ring is C1CNC(=O)O1. Therefore, when connected to the benzene, the full scaffold is c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC(=O)C2. Wait, but the ring closure is between C1 and O1. So the SMILES would be O1C(=O)NCC1. So the ring is O1-C(=O)-N-C-C1. So the SMILES is O1C(=O)NCC1. Therefore, when the benzene is connected to the N in this ring, the scaffold is c1ccc(cc1)N2C(=O)OCC2. Wait, that doesn't look right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look up an example. Murcko scaffold for a molecule with a benzene connected via a single bond to a five-membered ring. For example, if the five-membered ring is a lactam, the scaffold would be the benzene connected to the ring. So in this case, the correct SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC(=O)C2. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Let me use a tool to verify. Since I can't actually run a tool, I'll have to proceed carefully. Another approach: in the original SMILES, the rings are the benzene (c2ccc(...)cc2) and the five-membered ring O1 connected to C1. The connecting bond is between the N in the five-membered ring and the benzene. So the scaffold should be those two rings connected by that bond. All other substituents (like the C(C)=NO on the benzene and the acetyl group on the NCC1) are removed. So the benzene becomes c1ccc(cc1), the five-membered ring is C1CNC(=O)O1. Connecting them via the N: c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC(=O)C2. Wait, the five-membered ring's SMILES would be C1CNC(=O)O1, so combining with the benzene gives c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Wait, perhaps I need to reorder the atoms. Let me try writing the five-membered ring as O1C(=O)NCC1. Then the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)N2CCOC(=O)C2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct SMILES is c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Let's go with that. So the final answer should have the benzene connected to the five-membered ring via N, with the five-membered ring being O, C(=O), N, C, C. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. That seems plausible. Let me check again. The five-membered ring: starting at N2, connected to C3, which is connected to C4, which is connected to O5, which is connected to C(=O)6, which connects back to N2. Wait, but that would require a five-membered ring: N2-C3-C4-O5-C(=O)6-N2. That's five atoms: N, C, C, O, C(=O). But SMILES requires the ring closure to be correct. Alternatively, the ring is N2-C-C-O-C(=O)-N2. Which is five atoms. So the SMILES would be N2CC(=O)OC2. Yes. So combining with the benzene, it's c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2. Therefore, the output scaffold should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc(cc1)N2CC(=O)OC2\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Alright, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction problem. The input SMILES is NC(=O)c1cncnc1Nc1cccc(C(F)(F)F)c1. Hmm, first I need to parse this correctly. Let's break it down.\n\nThe molecule has several parts. Starting with the amide group NC(=O). Then there's a ring: c1cncnc1. That's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens, maybe a pyrimidine or similar. Next, there's an N connected to another benzene ring: Nc1cccc(...)c1. The substituent on that benzene is C(F)(F)F, which is a trifluoromethyl group.\n\nAccording to the Murcko scaffold definition, I need to remove all side chains and functional groups. So, the amide group (NC(=O)) is a side chain and should go. The trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) is an exocyclic substituent and must be removed. The connecting bonds between the rings should stay.\n\nSo, the rings are the pyrimidine-like ring (c1cncnc1) and the benzene ring (c1cccc([original substituent here])c1). After removing substituents, the benzene becomes c1ccccc1. The connecting bond is via the NH group, but since we remove functional groups, that NH might be part of the connecting bridge. Wait, the original structure has N connecting the two rings. So, the Murcko scaffold would be the two rings connected by the N atom, but without any substituents.\n\nWait, but the connecting atoms might need to be just the bonds. Let me think. The original molecule is NC(=O)c1cncnc1-N-c2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2. Removing side chains: the NC(=O) and the C(F)3 are removed. So the scaffold would be the two rings connected by the N. The first ring is c1cncnc1, the second ring is c2cccccc2 (but wait, the original benzene has five carbons? Wait, the SMILES is Nc1cccc(C(...))c1. That's a benzene ring with a substituent. So the benzene is six-membered: positions 1 (N), then four carbons in a row (c c c c), then the substituent at position 5, and back to position 6. Wait, SMILES notation builds the ring, so the actual benzene is c1cccc(C...)c1, which is six atoms. So when removing the substituent (C(F)(F)F), the benzene becomes c1ccccc1. Then, the scaffold is the two rings connected by the N. So the first ring is c1cncnc1 (with two nitrogens in the ring), connected via N to the benzene ring. Wait, but the connecting N is part of the first ring? Let me look again.\n\nOriginal SMILES: NC(=O)c1cncnc1Nc2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2. Breaking it down: The amide group is NC(=O)- attached to the first ring. The first ring is c1cncnc1, which is a five-membered ring? Wait, c1cncnc1: positions 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (N), 4 (C), 5 (N), and back to 1. Wait, that's a five-membered ring? No, wait, the indices go from 1 to 5, so it's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens. That's possible? Like a imidazole or something similar. Wait, c1cncnc1: positions 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (N), 4 (C), 5 (N), and closing the ring back to 1. So it's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens at positions 3 and 5. Then, attached to that ring is an N (from the Nc2... part). So the structure is: amide group -> five-membered ring -> N -> benzene ring with CF3.\n\nSo the Murcko scaffold would retain the five-membered ring and the benzene ring, connected by the N atom, but without the amide and CF3 groups. So the scaffold would be the five-membered ring (c1cncnc1) connected via N to the benzene ring (c2ccccc2). So the SMILES would be Nc1cncnc1c2ccccc2. Wait, but how are they connected? Let me reconstruct. The original structure has the five-membered ring c1cncnc1 with an N attached (from the Nc2... part). So the N is part of the connecting bond. So the scaffold would be c1cncnc1-N-c2ccccc2. So in SMILES notation, that's N(c1cncnc1)c2ccccc2. Wait, but the connecting N is between the two rings. So the SMILES would be c1cncnc1Nc2ccccc2. Let me check that. Yes, because the N is attached to the first ring and then to the benzene. So when written as c1cncnc1Nc2ccccc2, that should be correct. Let me verify with a SMILES parser if possible mentally. The first ring is five-membered: positions 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (N), 4 (C), 5 (N), connected back to 1. Then the N is attached to position 5 (assuming the numbering is correct). Then the benzene ring is c2ccccc2 connected via that N. So the final scaffold SMILES is c1cncnc1Nc2ccccc2. Let me check for any mistakes. The original SMILES had Nc2cccc(C...)c2. After removing the CF3 group, the benzene becomes c2ccccc2. So the connecting N remains. So yes, the scaffold should be the two rings connected by N. Therefore, the correct output is {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1cncnc1Nc2ccccc2\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction problem. The input SMILES is O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc(OCCNC3CCCCC3)cc(O)c12.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the ring systems. The main structure seems to have a central ring. Let me parse the SMILES. The molecule starts with a carbonyl group (O=) attached to a benzene ring (c1cc...). There's a substituent -c2ccccc2, which is another benzene ring attached as a side chain. Then there's an oxygen (o) connecting to another ring segment (c2cc...). In that part, there's an OCCNC3CCCCC3 group, which is an ethoxy chain attached to a piperidine ring (NC3CCCCC3). Also, there's a hydroxyl group (O) attached.\n\nThe Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and exocyclic groups. So, the benzene rings connected directly to the main ring should stay, but the substituents like the ethoxy-piperidine chain (OCCNC3CCCCC3) and the hydroxyl groups (O) need to be removed. The side benzene ring (-c2ccccc2) is attached via a single bond, so that might be considered a side chain and should be removed. Wait, but wait\u2014Murcko's definition says to leave ring systems and connecting bonds. So, if a substituent is another ring, is that part of the scaffold? Hmm. Wait, the Murcko scaffold includes all ring systems connected by linkers. So if there's a fused ring or bridged rings, they stay. But substituent rings attached via single bonds might be considered side chains. For example, if a benzene ring is attached via a single bond, like -C6H5, that's a side chain and should be removed. So in the input, the -c2ccccc2 is attached via a single bond (the \"-\" indicates a single bond), so that's a substituent and should be removed. Similarly, the OCCNC3... is a side chain on the oxygen, so that's removed. The hydroxyl groups (O) attached to the rings are functional groups, so they go. The carbonyl group (O=) is part of the ring? Let's see. The main ring starts with O=c1cc... so the carbonyl is part of the ring structure. Wait, in SMILES notation, the ring starts with c1, then the O= is part of the ring? Let me visualize. The first part is O=c1cc... which forms a ring. So the carbonyl oxygen is part of the ring, making it a cyclic structure like a quinone or similar. So the rings are the main structure, and any substituents attached via single bonds are removed.\n\nPutting it all together: Remove the -c2ccccc2 benzene substituent, remove the OCCNC3CCCCC3 chain, and remove the hydroxyl groups (O) that are exocyclic. What remains should be the fused ring system. Let me reconstruct. The main scaffold would be the central ring system. The original structure has a central ring with a carbonyl, connected to another ring via an oxygen. Wait, the SMILES is O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc(...)cc(O)c12. Breaking it down: the first ring (c1) is connected via an oxygen (o) to another ring fragment (c2). So the scaffold would include the fused rings connected by the oxygen bridge. The substituents like the benzene (c2ccccc2) and the OCC... chain are side chains. So removing those, the scaffold is the fused rings with the connecting oxygen. Also, the hydroxyl groups (O) on the rings would be removed. Wait, but are they part of the ring? If the oxygen is part of the ring, like in a furan or pyran, then it stays. For example, in a benzene ring with an oxygen (like in furan), the oxygen is part of the ring. But in this case, the hydroxyl groups (O) are likely substituents. Wait, looking at the SMILES: ...cc(O)c12. The O here is attached to the ring carbon, so that's a hydroxyl group, which is a functional group and should be removed. Similarly, the O in oc2 is part of the ring? Wait, the SMILES is oc2cc(...)cc(O)c12. The 'o' here is part of the ring? Let me parse the SMILES properly. The entire structure is O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc(OCCNC3CCCCC3)cc(O)c12. The rings are numbered as 1 and 2. Let's break it down:\n\nStarting from O=c1: this is a carbonyl group (O=C) attached to a carbon which is part of ring 1 (c1). Then comes cc(-c2ccccc2)o: so carbon connected to another carbon (the first c), then a carbon with a substituent (-c2ccccc2, which is a benzene ring), then an oxygen (o) which is part of ring 1? Wait, the SMILES notation can be a bit tricky. Let me try to write out the connections.\n\nRing 1 is started with O=c1. Then comes cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2... So the sequence is O=C1-C(-C2=C(C=C2))-C-O-C2... The oxygen here is part of ring 1 and connects to ring 2. So the rings are connected via the oxygen. So the scaffold would include both rings connected by the oxygen, but without substituents. The substituents are the benzene (from -c2ccccc2) and the OCCNC3... group. Also, the hydroxyl groups (O) attached to the rings are functional groups and need to be removed. The carbonyl group (O=C) is part of the ring, so it stays.\n\nSo the final scaffold would be the fused ring system without the substituents. Let me draw this mentally. The main structure is a bicyclic system where one ring has a carbonyl group and is connected via an oxygen bridge to another ring. Removing all substituents (benzene, ethoxy-piperidine, hydroxyls), the scaffold is O=C1C2=C(C(=O)C=C1)OC=C2. Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to reconstruct the SMILES. The original SMILES after removing substituents would be O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. Wait, but the original had multiple substituents. Let me remove the substituents step by step.\n\nOriginal: O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc(OCCNC3CCCCC3)cc(O)c12.\n\nRemove the -c2ccccc2 substituent (benzene): O=c1ccoc2cc(OCCNC3CCCCC3)cc(O)c12.\n\nRemove the OCCNC3CCCCC3 (side chain on oxygen): replace that part with just oxygen? Wait, the OCC... is attached to the ring. So the part after oc2 is cc(OCC...)cc(O)c12. Removing the OCCNC3..., the c becomes just c, so oc2ccc... So the SMILES becomes O=c1ccoc2ccccc(O)c12. Then remove the hydroxyl (O) on the ring: O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. But wait, the hydroxyl was part of the ring? No, because in the SMILES, the O is attached to a carbon in the ring (c12), so it's a substituent. So removing that, the scaffold is O=C1C=CC(=O)C=C1Oc2ccccc12. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me count the atoms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the core ring system: the two fused rings connected by an oxygen. The main rings are the quinone-like ring (O=C1C=C-O-C2=C...) and another ring. Wait, perhaps the scaffold is O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. Let me check. The original molecule has a ring formed by c1 and another ring formed by c2. The connecting atoms are the oxygen. So after removing substituents, the scaffold would be O=C1C=C-O-C2=CC=C(C1)C2. But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the Murcko scaffold retains all rings and the linkers between them. So any atom that is part of a ring or a connecting bond (like a single bond between two rings) stays. Any substituents (like -R groups) are removed. So in the input, the benzene ring attached via a single bond (-c2ccccc2) is a substituent and is removed. The ethoxy-piperidine chain is a substituent on the oxygen and is removed. The hydroxyl groups (O) attached to the rings are functional groups and are removed. The carbonyl (O=C) is part of the ring, so it stays. The oxygen connecting the two rings is part of the linker and stays. So the remaining scaffold is the two fused rings connected by the oxygen. Wait, but are the rings fused or connected via a single bond? Let me parse the SMILES again. The SMILES is O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2cc(...)cc(O)c12. The 'oc2' suggests that the oxygen is part of ring1 and connects to ring2. So the rings are connected via an oxygen atom. So the scaffold would be O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. But wait, the original SMILES after removing substituents would have the rings connected via oxygen. Let me check: the main rings are ring1 (starting at c1) and ring2 (starting at c2). The connection is via the oxygen. So the scaffold SMILES would be O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. However, when I remove the substituents, the 'oc2' part remains. Let me write the scaffold as O=C1C=C(Oc2ccccc2)C(=O)C1. But I need to ensure that the rings are properly closed. Alternatively, perhaps the scaffold is O=C1C2=C(C(=O)C=C1)OC=C2. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think of the original structure. The main ring is a six-membered ring with two oxygen atoms? Or maybe a five-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is O=c1ccc2oc3ccccc3c2c1. No, that might not be right. Alternatively, the correct scaffold is O=C1C=C(Oc2ccccc2)C(=O)C1. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to reconstruct the scaffold step by step. Remove all substituents except rings and connecting bonds. The original molecule has a central core where two benzene rings are connected via an oxygen atom, with a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps the main scaffold is a benzofuran or similar. Let's see: O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. That would be a quinone fused with a furan ring? Or maybe a dibenzofuran-like structure. Alternatively, considering the original SMILES, after removing substituents, the scaffold would be O=c1ccc2oc3ccccc3c2c1. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is O=C1C=C(Oc2ccccc2)C(=O)C1. But I need to verify. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is O=c1cc(-c2ccccc2)oc2ccccc12 but without the substituent. Wait, no, the substituent -c2ccccc2 is a benzene attached via a single bond, which is a side chain and should be removed. So after removing that, the SMILES becomes O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. Let me check if that's a valid SMILES. O=C1C=C(Oc2ccccc12). Wait, perhaps O=C1C=C(Oc2ccccc12)C(=O)C1. Hmm. Alternatively, the correct SMILES is O=c1coc2ccccc12. But I'm not confident. Maybe the actual scaffold is O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. Let me try to write it properly. The SMILES would be O=C1C=COC2=CC=CC=C12. Yes, that makes sense. So the main rings are a quinone (O=C1C=CC(=O)C=C1) connected via an oxygen to a benzene ring (OC2=CC=CC=C2). Wait, but in the original structure, the oxygen is part of the ring? Maybe it's a dioxane or similar. Alternatively, perhaps the scaffold is O=C1C=CC(=O)C2=C1Oc3ccccc23. No, I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is O=C1C=C(Oc2ccccc2)C(=O)C1. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is O=c1ccc2oc3ccccc3c2c1. Let me check with a SMILES validator. Alternatively, considering the input SMILES, the rings are numbered 1 and 2. The first ring (1) is O=c1cc... and the second ring (2) is oc2cc... So the scaffold would be O=C1=CC(Oc2ccccc12)C(=O)C=C1. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to remove all substituents and retain only the rings and the connecting bonds. So the final scaffold SMILES is O=c1ccoc2ccccc12. Let's structure that. The first ring is O=C1C=C-O-C2=CC=CC=C12. So the SMILES would be O=C1C=COC2=CC=CC=C12. But when I write that, does it form a fused ring? No, it's two separate rings connected by an oxygen. Wait, but in the original SMILES, the rings are connected via the oxygen. So the scaffold would be two benzene rings connected by an oxygen, but with a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe the first ring is a cyclohexenone (O=C1C=CC...), connected via oxygen to a benzene ring. So the SMILES would be O=C1C=COC2=CC=CC=C12. That's a valid SMILES. Let me check if that's the case. Yes, in the original molecule, after removing the substituents, that's the structure. So the answer should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"O=c1ccoc2ccccc12\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the Murcko scaffold from the given SMILES. The input molecule is Cn1c(=O)c(Oc2ccc(F)cc2F)cc2cnc(N3CCCC(O)C3)nc21. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the Murcko scaffold definition. It's about retaining the ring systems and the connecting bonds, removing all side chains, functional groups, and exocyclic groups. So, any substituents attached to the rings that aren't part of the ring structure itself should be stripped away.\n\nLooking at the SMILES: Let's parse it. The main structure has rings. The SMILES starts with Cn1c(=O)c(...). The 'n1' indicates a nitrogen in a ring. The (=O) is a carbonyl group attached to the ring. Then there's an O connected to a benzene ring with two F atoms (Oc2ccc(F)cc2F). That's a di-fluorophenyl group attached via an oxygen, which is a side chain. Next, there's a cc2cnc(...) part. The 'cnc' suggests another ring, maybe a fused ring system. The N3CCCC(O)C3 part is a piperazine ring with an OH group. That's another substituent, probably an exocyclic amine with a hydroxyl group.\n\nSo, the rings here are the main core. The main ring system seems to be a bicyclic structure. Let me draw this mentally. The first ring is a five-membered ring with nitrogen (from the n1). The carbonyl (=O) is a substituent here, so that should be removed. Then there's the oxygen-linked di-fluorophenyl group, which is a side chain, so we remove that. The other part is the c2cnc(N3CCCC(O)C3)nc21. The N3CCCC(O)C3 is a piperidine ring with an OH, which is a substituent. So removing that leaves the c2cnc(nc21) part, which forms another ring fused to the first one.\n\nPutting it all together, the Murcko scaffold should be the fused bicyclic system without the substituents. So the rings are the two fused rings: the first ring (with nitrogen and the carbonyl, but we remove the carbonyl) and the second ring. Wait, but wait. The carbonyl is part of the ring? Let me check again. The SMILES is Cn1c(=O)c(...)cc2cnc(...)nc21. The first ring is the 'n1c(=O)c...cc2...nc21' part. Wait, the atom numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me break it down:\n\nThe first atom is C connected to n1. Then c(=O) is the next atom in the ring. Then c(Oc2...) is the third atom. The ring closure is at the end with 1. So the first ring is a 5-membered ring: C, N, C(=O), C(O...), and another C connected back to N. Wait, maybe it's a 6-membered ring? Let me count. The SMILES is Cn1c(=O)c(Oc2...)cc2cnc(...)nc21. The 'n1' is the first atom. Then c(=O) is the second, then c(Oc2...) is third, then cc2... which might be part of the same ring. Hmm, perhaps it's a bicyclic system with two fused rings. Maybe the first ring is a six-membered ring including the nitrogen and the carbonyl, and the second ring is another six-membered ring fused to it. The substituents like the O-linked di-F benzene and the piperazine with OH are all side chains. So removing those, the scaffold would be the fused bicyclic rings. \n\nSo the output SMILES would be the core rings without the substituents. The main rings are connected by the bridge. So, for example, if the original structure has a fused bicyclic system where the substituents are the O-c2ccc(F)cc2F and the N3CCCC(O)C3, then removing those would leave the two fused rings. Let me try to write the SMILES for that. The core would be the bicyclic system: n1c2cccnc2c1. Wait, perhaps something like c1nccc2c1ncc2. Maybe not. Let me reconstruct. The original SMILES after removing substituents: The main rings would be the atoms connected in the rings without the branches. So the main scaffold would be the nitrogen-containing rings. Let's remove the =O, the O-linked groups, and the N-linked piperazine. The remaining structure would be the fused rings. So perhaps the SMILES is c1c2cnc(N)nc2cn1. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the core might be a benzimidazole-like structure but fused with another ring. Alternatively, the scaffold could be a bicyclo system with two nitrogens. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is the fused rings without any substituents. Let me check an example. For instance, if the original molecule has a central bicyclic system where the rings are connected via a bridge, then the Murcko scaffold would retain that. So, the SMILES might be something like C1=NC2=CN=C(NC3CCCC(O)C3)N=C2C=C1. But removing substituents like the =O, the O-c2ccc(F)cc2F, and the NC3CCCC(O)C3 would leave the core as C1NC2=CN=CN=C2C=C1. Wait, but maybe the connecting bonds are the bridge between the two rings. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the scaffold is a system where the two rings are fused via a bridge. For example, the SMILES could be c1c(cc2ncnc2n1). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should use a tool or software to do this properly, but since I'm doing this manually, I have to parse the SMILES step by step. \n\nOriginal SMILES: Cn1c(=O)c(Oc2ccc(F)cc2F)cc2cnc(N3CCCC(O)C3)nc21\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main scaffold starts with C attached to n1 (which is part of a ring).\n- The next atom is c(=O), which is part of the ring. So the first ring includes C, n1, c(=O), and so on.\n- Then there's a c(Oc2ccc(F)cc2F), which is a carbon connected to an oxygen and a benzene ring with two F atoms. This is a substituent, so we remove the entire Oc2ccc(F)cc2F group.\n- Then cc2cnc(N3CCCC(O)C3)nc21: the 'cc2' suggests a connection to a second ring. The 'cnc(N3...)' part includes a nitrogen connected to a piperazine ring (N3CCCC(O)C3), which is a substituent. So removing that substituent leaves the 'cnc' part as part of the ring.\n\nSo the core rings would be the first ring (n1, c(=O), c, etc.) and the second ring (c, n, c, etc.), fused together. However, the =O is a functional group attached to the ring, so that should be removed. So the c(=O) becomes just c. Similarly, any exocyclic double bonds might stay if they are part of the ring. Wait, the =O is a carbonyl group, which is a substituent. So removing that, the carbon becomes CH instead of C=O. But in SMILES notation, if the ring has a double bond, it's part of the ring's structure. Wait, the c(=O) is a carbon double-bonded to oxygen. Since oxygen is a substituent, we remove the =O, leaving the carbon as a single bond. But if the ring was originally with a carbonyl, would that affect the ring structure? For example, if the ring had a carbonyl, removing the O would leave a single bond. However, the Murcko scaffold definition says to remove functional groups, but keep the ring structure. So the ring skeleton remains, but substituents like =O, -O-, etc., are removed. So the rings are retained, but substituents are stripped. So in this case, the carbonyl oxygen is a substituent, so it's removed. The connecting bonds between rings are kept.\n\nSo after removing all substituents (the =O, the O-linked benzene, and the N-linked piperazine), the core would be the bicyclic system where the rings are connected. Let's reconstruct the SMILES without those groups. \n\nOriginal SMILES after removing substituents:\n\nn1c(C)c(cc2cnc(nc21)) \n\nWait, maybe not. Let me try to remove the substituents step by step. The original SMILES is:\n\nCn1c(=O)c(Oc2ccc(F)cc2F)cc2cnc(N3CCCC(O)C3)nc21\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first atom is C (methyl group attached to n1), which is a substituent. Remove it, so the first atom becomes n1.\n- Next is c(=O), which is a carbonyl. Remove the =O, leaving just c.\n- Then c(Oc2...) is a carbon attached to an oxygen and a benzene ring. Remove the entire Oc2... group, leaving just c.\n- Then cc2... The 'cc2' connects to the next part. The 'cc2cnc(N3...)nc21' part: the N3 substituent is a piperazine ring with OH. Remove that, leaving 'cnc' as part of the ring.\n- So the remaining structure is n1c(c)c(c2cnc(nc21)). But I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe the correct scaffold is the fused ring system without any substituents. Let's imagine the core as n1c2ccnc2cn1. Wait, maybe the correct SMILES is c1c2cnc(n2)c2ncnc12. Alternatively, perhaps the scaffold is a bicyclic system with two fused rings, each containing nitrogen atoms. \n\nAnother approach: The Murcko scaffold retains all rings and the connecting bonds. So, in the input molecule, identify all rings and the bonds that connect them. Then remove all substituents. \n\nLooking at the input, the rings are:\n\n1. The central ring containing the n1 and the c(=O). This might be a five-membered ring? Let's see: n1 connected to c(=O), then to c(Oc2...), then to c (from cc2...), then to another c (from cc2...), and back to n1? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there are two fused rings. Let's count the ring closures. The input SMILES ends with nc21, indicating that atom 21 is part of ring closure. So ring 1 is closed at n1 and the last c (atom 21), and ring 2 is closed at c2 and the last nc21. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclo[4.3.0] system. But without drawing it, it's hard. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct scaffold is the fused rings without substituents. The substituents are the methyl group (Cn1), the carbonyl (=O), the O-linked di-F benzene, and the N-linked piperazine. Removing those, the core would be the fused bicyclic system with the nitrogens. So the SMILES would be c1nc2ccncn2c1. Wait, testing that: c1nc2ccncn2c1. Let me check. That would be a bicyclic system with two nitrogens. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is c1cnc2ncnc2c1. \n\nAlternatively, considering the original SMILES: after removing substituents, the core would be n1c(cc2cncnc21). So n1 is part of a ring connected to c, then another c, then cc2 (which starts another ring), c, n, c, n, c2 (closing ring 2), then back to n1. So the scaffold SMILES would be n1ccc2cncnc2n1. Let's see: n1 is the first atom, connected to c, then c, then c2. Then c2 is connected to n, c, n, c2 (ring closure), and back to n1. Hmm, but that might not capture the correct structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1c2cnc(nc2n1). Let me write that: c1c2cnc(nc2n1). That would form a fused bicyclic system. But I'm not entirely confident. \n\nGiven the time I have and the need to provide an answer, I'll proceed with the best possible SMILES based on the analysis. The key is to retain the fused rings and remove all substituents. So the final answer should be the core rings without the substituents.",

The 'c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1' part forms a ring with two nitrogens. So that's a five-membered ring with two nitrogens and a sulfur substituent. Wait, the sulfur has a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)C), but that's a side chain. The benzene ring attached to the central carbon (c1ccccc1) is a separate ring. The connecting bonds would be the parts linking these rings. The central part is the amide groups (NC(=O)N), but those are connecting the two rings. So removing all side chains: the methyl groups (C) attached to the central carbon and the sulfonyl group on the bicyclic ring. The Murcko scaffold should retain the two benzene rings and the bicyclic ring connected via the amide bonds. Wait, but the connecting bonds are the amide linkages. According to the definition, we leave the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So the rings are the benzene (from c1ccccc1) and the bicyclic ring (the c1cc2[nH]nc...c2cn1 part). The connecting bonds between them are the NC(=O)N. But wait, the amide groups might be considered part of the connecting framework. So the scaffold would be the bicyclic ring connected via the amide link to the benzene ring. Let me draw this out mentally. The original molecule has a central carbon attached to a benzene, an amide group (NC(=O)N), which connects to the bicyclic ring. The sulfonyl group (S(C)(=O)=O) on the bicyclic ring is a substituent, so it's removed. The methyl groups (the C in CC(...)) are also side chains. So stripping those away, the scaffold is the bicyclic ring (with the two nitrogens, but without the sulfonyl) connected via the amide groups to the benzene. Wait, but the amide groups are part of the connecting bonds. So the final scaffold should have the two rings connected by the amide link. Let me check the SMILES structure again. The central part is NC(=O)N connecting the benzene (c1ccccc1) to the bicyclic ring. The bicyclic ring is c1cc2[nH]n...c2cn1. Wait, the exact structure of the bicyclic ring: the 'c1cc2[nH]nc(...)c2cn1' part. The indices are c1 connected to c2, then the [nH] is part of a five-membered ring? Let me count: positions 1, 2 (c), then [nH], n, c (from the sulfonyl part), then back to position 1 via cn1. Hmm, maybe it's a fused ring system. Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclic ring is a 6-5 fused system. Regardless, the key is to retain the rings and the connecting bonds. So the substituents like the sulfonyl and the methyl groups are removed. The central amide groups are part of the connecting structure. So the resulting scaffold SMILES would be the benzene ring connected via NC(=O)N to the bicyclic ring, with all substituents removed. Let me reconstruct that. The benzene is c1ccccc1. The amide part is NC(=O)N. The bicyclic ring would be c2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2. Wait, the original SMILES for the bicyclic part is c1cc2[nH]nc(S(C)(=O)=O)c2cn1. Removing the S(C)(=O)=O substituent, the 'nc(...)' becomes 'nc', so the ring becomes c1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1. So connecting everything: the benzene (c1ccccc1) is attached via the central C (from CC(...)) but wait, the original molecule starts with CC(...). The central carbon is connected to the benzene (c1ccccc1), the amide group (NC(=O)N), and another methyl group (the first C in CC). But in the scaffold, we need to remove all side chains. So the central carbon's branches: the benzene is part of the scaffold, the amide is part of the connecting bonds, and the methyl (C) is a side chain. Wait, the central structure is CC(...) where the C is connected to the benzene (c1ccccc1), the amide group, and another methyl (the first C in CC). So in the scaffold, that central C should lose the methyl group, so it becomes just C connected to the benzene and the amide. But wait, the Murcko scaffold definition says to leave the ring systems and connecting bonds. So perhaps the central carbon is part of the connecting bond. Let me visualize the molecule. The main chain might be the benzene ring connected via a carbon (the central C) to the amide group, which then connects to the bicyclic ring. If that's the case, then the central C is part of the connecting chain. But since Murcko scaffold removes all side chains, the methyl group attached to the central C would be removed. So the scaffold would have the benzene connected via a single carbon (without the methyl) to the amide group, then to the bicyclic ring. But in SMILES notation, how does that look? Let me reconstruct. The original SMILES is CC(...) where the first C is connected to another C (the central one) which has branches. But if we remove the methyl (the first C), then the central C becomes just a single carbon connected to the benzene, the amide, and the remaining parts. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is to remove all atoms that are not part of rings or connecting chains between rings. Rings are the benzene and the bicyclic ring. The connecting chain is the NC(=O)N between them. The central C might be part of the connecting chain. But the initial CC(...) suggests a carbon with a methyl group (side chain) and the rest. So removing the methyl, the central C would be part of the connecting chain. Therefore, the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via C-N-C(=O)-N to the bicyclic ring. But in SMILES terms, that would be c1ccccc1C(NC(=O)Nc2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2). Wait, but the central C after removing the methyl would have three bonds: to the benzene, to the amide N, and to another C? Wait, maybe I need to re-express this. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the benzene ring connected via the amide linkage (NC(=O)N) to the bicyclic ring, with the central carbon being part of the connecting chain. So the SMILES would be Nc1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1 connected via NC(=O)N to the benzene. But the benzene is attached via a carbon. Wait, the original SMILES has \"CC(NC(=O)Nc1cc2...\", so the central C is connected to the benzene (c1ccccc1), the amide group (NC(=O)N...), and a methyl group (the first C). So in the scaffold, we remove the methyl, leaving the central C connected to the benzene and the amide. So the structure would be C(NC(=O)Nc1cc2[nH]ncc2cn1)c1ccccc1. But that central C is part of the connecting chain. However, the Murcko scaffold might require that all non-ring atoms are part of the connecting bonds between rings. So the central C is part of the linker. Therefore, the SMILES would be c1ccccc1C(NC(=O)Nc2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2). Checking valence: the central C has four bonds: two to the benzene (no, the benzene is a ring, so the C in the benzene is connected once), wait, the benzene is c1ccccc1, which is a six-membered ring. The central C is attached to one of the benzene's carbons. So the central C is connected to the benzene ring, the amide N, and another carbon (the methyl group, which is removed). So after removing the methyl, the central C has three bonds: to benzene, to N, and one remaining bond. Wait, that would leave a valence of three, which is not possible. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Perhaps the central carbon is part of a chain that connects the benzene to the amide group. Let me think again. The original molecule is CC(...) where the first C is connected to the central C, which is connected to the benzene (c1ccccc1), the amide group (NC(=O)N...), and another methyl. Removing the methyl groups (the first C and the S(C) part), the central C would be connected to the benzene, the amide N, and another C (but that C was part of the methyl group, which is removed). Wait, that would leave the central C with only two bonds: to benzene and to N. That's not possible. So perhaps the central C is retained as part of the connecting chain. But maybe the Murcko scaffold requires that all acyclic atoms are part of the minimal structure connecting the rings. So perhaps the correct scaffold is the benzene ring connected via a single carbon (the central C) to the amide group, which connects to the bicyclic ring. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1C(NC(=O)Nc2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2). This way, the central C is part of the linker between the benzene and the amide. But does that make sense? The valence of the central C would be four: bonded to benzene's C, the N, and two more? Wait, in the original structure, the central C is connected to the methyl (which we remove), the benzene, the amide N, and another bond. Wait, maybe the original structure has the central C connected to the benzene (c1ccccc1), the amide N (NC(=O)N...), and two other carbons (the methyl and another C?). No, the original SMILES starts with CC(...), so the first C is connected to the central C, which is connected to the benzene, the amide N, and another group. So after removing the methyl (the first C), the central C would have three bonds: to benzene, amide N, and another bond. That can't be right. Maybe there's an error in how I'm parsing the SMILES. Let me parse the SMILES again: CC(NC(=O)Nc1cc2[nH]nc(S(C)(=O)=O)c2cn1)c1ccccc1. The central atom is the second C (the one attached to the first C). This central C is connected to:\n\n- The first C (methyl group, which is a side chain to be removed)\n- The NC(=O)Nc1cc2... group\n- The benzene ring (c1ccccc1)\n\nSo after removing the methyl, the central C is connected to the benzene and the NC(=O)N... group. That leaves the central C with three bonds: two to the benzene (wait, no, the benzene is a ring, so each carbon is part of the ring and connected to two other carbons in the ring and any substituents. So the central C is attached to one carbon of the benzene ring, the NC(=O)N group, and the methyl (which is removed). So after removal, the central C is connected to the benzene and the NC(=O)N group. But that would mean the central C has only two bonds (to benzene and NC(=O)N), which is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the central C is retained as part of the scaffold's connecting chain. But how? Maybe the connecting chain includes that central C and the amide group. So the scaffold includes the benzene ring, the central C, the amide group, and the bicyclic ring. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1C(NC(=O)Nc2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2). However, the central C here is part of the connecting chain. But according to the Murcko definition, connecting bonds are the minimal necessary to link the rings. So if the central C is necessary to connect the benzene to the amide group, then it's part of the scaffold. But perhaps in this case, the benzene is connected via a single bond to the central C, which is then connected to the amide group. Therefore, the scaffold includes that central C. So the final SMILES would be c1ccccc1C(NC(=O)Nc2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2). Let me check the valence of each atom. The central C is connected to the benzene (one bond), the amide N (one bond), and another bond (from the original methyl, which is removed). Wait, that leaves the central C with two bonds, which is impossible. So perhaps there's an error in my approach. Maybe the correct scaffold doesn't include that central C. Alternatively, perhaps the original molecule's structure is different. Let me try to draw it. The SMILES is CC(...) where the first C is connected to the central C. The central C has three substituents: the methyl (to be removed), the benzene ring, and the NC(=O)N group. Removing the methyl, the central C would need to have two substituents: benzene and NC(=O)N. But that's only two bonds, so perhaps the original structure has a branching that I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe the central C is part of a chain that includes another carbon. Wait, no. The SMILES is CC(...), so it's two carbons in a row. The first C (methyl) is connected to the central C. The central C is connected to the benzene, the NC(=O)N group, and the first C. So after removing the first C (methyl), the central C is connected to the benzene and NC(=O)N. But that's two substituents. Therefore, the valence is not satisfied. Therefore, perhaps the correct scaffold doesn't include that central C. Maybe I need to re-express the SMILES without that central C. Alternatively, perhaps the connecting chain is the NC(=O)N between the benzene and the bicyclic ring, and the central C is part of a side chain. Wait, but how? This is getting confusing. Let's look for another approach. Maybe using a tool would help, but since I can't do that, I'll proceed logically. The Murcko scaffold retains rings and connecting chains. The benzene is a ring. The bicyclic part is another ring. The connecting chain is the NC(=O)N between them. But in the original structure, the NC(=O)N is attached to the central C, which is attached to the benzene. So the connecting chain would be C-N-C(=O)-N. Therefore, the scaffold includes that central C as part of the connecting chain. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1C(NC(=O)Nc2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2). However, the central C here has three bonds: to benzene, N, and what else? It should have four bonds. Wait, perhaps the benzene is attached via a single bond to the central C, which is then connected to the N. The central C would have two more hydrogens to satisfy valence. But in SMILES, hydrogens are implicit. So the SMILES would be valid. Therefore, the correct scaffold is the benzene ring connected via a methylene group (C) to the amide linkage, which connects to the bicyclic ring. Therefore, the SMILES is c1ccccc1C(NC(=O)Nc2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2). Let me check that. The bicyclic part after removing the sulfonyl group is c2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2. So combining everything: the benzene (c1ccccc1) connected to C, which is connected to NC(=O)N, which is connected to the bicyclic ring (c2cc3[nH]ncc3cn2). That seems to make sense. So the final answer should be that SMILES.",

It's the core structure consisting of ring systems and the connecting bonds between them, with all side chains and functional groups stripped away.\n\nLooking at the input molecule, I'll parse the SMILES. The main parts here are the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to an amine group (N). Then there's a long chain: CCCCCCC connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is further connected to an NO group (O=C(...)NO). \n\nThe benzene ring is a ring system, so that's part of the scaffold. The amine (N) is attached to the benzene. The next part is the seven-carbon chain (CCCCCCC) connecting to another carbonyl. But wait, the connecting bonds between rings are kept. However, the long chain here isn't part of a ring. Wait, maybe I need to check if there's another ring. The benzene is one ring. The other parts: the chain and the carbonyl groups might be substituents.\n\nWait, the connecting bonds are the ones that link different ring systems. Since there's only one benzene ring here, the rest are side chains. So the Murcko scaffold would be just the benzene ring? But wait, the N is part of the ring substituent. Wait, the benzene ring is c1ccccc1. The N is attached as Nc1ccccc1. But in the original SMILES, the N is connected to the chain: Nc1ccccc1 is part of the structure. So the N is part of the side chain? Or is it part of the scaffold?\n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold keeps the ring systems and the connecting bonds. Any substituents on the rings that are not part of another ring should be removed. So if the benzene has an NH group attached (like aniline), the NH would be a substituent and removed. But in this case, the N is connected to the chain. So the benzene ring is the only ring system. The side chain is the N connected to the seven-carbon chain and the other groups. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would be the benzene ring itself. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1. Let me confirm. The original molecule has a benzene ring connected via an amine to a long chain with carbonyl and nitroxy groups. All those chains and functional groups are side chains, so they get removed. The scaffold is just the benzene ring. That makes sense. So the output should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccccc1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is Cc1cc(C(N)=O)ccc1-n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1-c1ccc(-c2cnn(C)c2)cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the ring systems and the connecting bonds. The Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and functional groups, keeping only the rings and the linkers between them.\n\nLooking at the structure, there are three aromatic rings connected by single bonds. The first ring is a benzene (c1ccccc1) with some substituents: a methyl (C), a carbonylamide (C(N)=O), and a nitro group (-n...). Wait, no, the nitro might not be a substituent here. Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nThe SMILES starts with Cc1cc(C(N)=O)ccc1- which is a benzene ring with a methyl group and a C(N)=O group attached. Then connected via a single bond to n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1, which is another aromatic ring (maybe a pyridine or similar) with a propyl chain ending in a carboxylic acid. Then another single bond to c1ccc(-c2cnn(C)c2)cc1, which is another benzene ring with a substituent that's a cyano group attached to another ring? Wait, the substituent here is -c2cnn(C)c2, which is a triazole ring (c2cnn(C)c2) connected via a single bond.\n\nSo the main rings are the three aromatic rings: the first benzene, the middle ring (maybe a pyridine), and the third benzene. The connecting bonds are the single bonds between them. The substituents like methyl, C(N)=O, CCC(=O)O, and the triazole (c2cnn(C)c2) need to be removed.\n\nSo, stripping away all side chains: the methyl (C), the C(N)=O, the CCC(=O)O, and the triazole ring attached to the third benzene. Wait, but the triazole is part of a substituent on the third benzene? So the third benzene has a substituent which is a triazole. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would retain the three aromatic rings connected by the single bonds, but remove all substituents except the rings themselves and the connecting bonds.\n\nSo the scaffold would be the three rings connected by single bonds. Let me visualize:\n\nFirst ring: benzene (c1ccc(cc1)), connected via single bond to the middle ring (n1cccc1), then another single bond to the third benzene (c1cccc1). But need to check if the middle ring is a six-membered ring. Wait, the middle part is n1c(...)ccc1. So it's a five-membered ring? Let's parse that part: n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1. The ring indices: n1 is position 1, then position 2 is c connected to the propyl chain, then positions 3,4,5 are c, c, c, and back to position 1. Wait, that would be a five-membered ring? n1c...ccc1 would have positions 1 (N), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (C), 5 (C), then back to 1? That makes a five-membered ring. But that seems odd because the SMILES notation for a five-membered ring would have five atoms. Let me count: n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1. The ring closure is at the end with ccc1. So positions 1 (N), 2 (C with substituent), 3 (C), 4 (C), 5 (C), and then back to 1? That's a six-membered ring? Wait, no. If the SMILES is n1c...ccc1, the ring starts with N at position 1, then c (position 2), followed by three c's (positions 3,4,5), and then closing the ring back to position 1. That would be a five-membered ring, but that's impossible because after the N, you have four more atoms (positions 2-5) plus closing back to 1, making five atoms total. But a five-membered ring can't have three c's after the initial N and c. Wait, maybe I'm parsing this wrong. Let's break it down:\n\nThe middle part is -n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1-. The 'n1' starts the ring, then 'c' is the next atom (position 2), followed by three 'c's (positions 3,4,5?), and then closing with '1' to form the ring. That would make a five-membered ring: N-C-C-C-C, connected back to N? That would be a pyrrole-like structure, but with all carbons except the N. But that would be a five-membered ring. However, the substituent on the second carbon (position 2) is CCC(=O)O, which is a propanoic acid group. So the middle ring is a five-membered aromatic ring with one N and four Cs. But then, in the scaffold, this ring should be retained, along with the connecting bonds to the adjacent benzene rings.\n\nSimilarly, the third part is -c1ccc(-c2cnn(C)c2)cc1. The main ring here is a benzene (six-membered), with a substituent that's another ring: c2cnn(C)c2. That substituent is a five-membered ring (positions 1: C, 2: C, 3: N, 4: N, 5: C with a methyl group?), connected via a single bond. So the substituent is a triazole ring (since it has three Ns? Wait, the SMILES is c2cnn(C)c2. Let's parse that: position 1: C, position 2: C, position 3: N, position 4: N connected to a methyl (C), position 5: C, and back to position 1. So positions 1-5: C-C-N-N-C, forming a five-membered ring with two adjacent Ns and a methyl on one of the Ns. That's a 1,2,3-triazole? No, wait, triazoles have three Ns. Wait, this ring has two Ns. So maybe it's a pyrazole derivative. Regardless, that substituent is a side chain and should be removed. So the third benzene ring in the scaffold would lose that substituent.\n\nPutting it all together, the Murcko scaffold should consist of the three aromatic rings connected by single bonds. The first ring is benzene, connected via single bond to the middle five-membered ring (with one N), connected via single bond to the third benzene ring. All substituents (methyl, C(N)=O, propanoic acid chain, triazole ring) are removed. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)-n1cccc1-c1cccc1. Wait, but need to make sure the rings are properly closed. Let me reconstruct:\n\nFirst benzene ring: the original part is Cc1cc(C(N)=O)ccc1-. The core is the benzene ring, so after removing substituents (C and C(N)=O), it's c1ccccc1. But in the input, it's written as Cc1cc(C(N)=O)ccc1, which is a benzene with substituents at positions 1 (methyl), position 3 (C(N)=O), and then connected via a single bond. So stripping those substituents, the benzene becomes c1ccccc1, but the connection is via the nitrogen ring. Wait, the original SMILES is connected to the middle ring via a single bond. So the first ring is c1ccc(cc1) after removing substituents, connected via - to the middle ring.\n\nThe middle ring is n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1. Removing the CCC(=O)O substituent, it becomes n1cccc1. Wait, the middle ring is n1c...ccc1. After removing the substituent on the C atom (position 2?), the ring is n1cccc1. But wait, the original ring closure is n1c...ccc1, which would be positions 1 (N), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (C), 5 (C), and then back to 1. That's a five-membered ring. So the middle ring is a five-membered aromatic ring with one N and four Cs. So the scaffold for this part is n1cccc1.\n\nThe third ring is c1ccc(-c2cnn(C)c2)cc1. Removing the substituent (-c2cnn(C)c2), it becomes c1ccccc1.\n\nBut the connecting bonds are between the first benzene and the middle ring, and between the middle ring and the third benzene. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)-n1cccc1-c1ccccc1. Wait, but SMILES notation requires proper ring closures. Let me ensure the numbering is correct. Alternatively, the scaffold would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2. Hmm, perhaps it's better to represent each ring with their own closures. Let me reconstruct:\n\nFirst benzene: c1ccccc1 connected via - to the middle ring (n1cccc1), then connected via - to the third benzene (c1ccccc1). But SMILES notation needs proper closure. So combining them:\n\nThe first benzene is written as c1ccccc1. The middle ring is n2cccc2. The third benzene is c3ccccc3. The connections are between the first benzene's position (where the substituent was) to the middle ring's position, and the middle ring to the third benzene. So the full SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2. But I need to make sure the connections are correctly placed.\n\nAlternatively, the correct SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccccc3. However, in SMILES notation, the order of writing matters for the ring closures. Let me try to write it step by step.\n\nStarting with the first benzene: c1cccc(-n2cccc2)c1. Then connected via a single bond to the third benzene: c1cccc(-n2cccc2)c1-c3ccccc3. Wait, but the middle ring is n2cccc2. So the first benzene has a single bond to the N of the middle ring? Or to a carbon? In the original SMILES, the first benzene is connected to the middle ring via a single bond from a carbon to the N? Let me check the original input again.\n\nOriginal input: ...ccc1-n1c(... The first benzene's closing is ...ccc1- which connects to n1c(... So the single bond is between the benzene's carbon (position 6 perhaps?) and the N (n1) of the middle ring. So in the scaffold, the connection is benzene-N (middle ring). Therefore, the scaffold would have the benzene connected to the N of the middle ring. Then the middle ring is connected to the third benzene via a single bond. Looking at the original input: ...ccc1-c1ccc(... So after the middle ring (n1c(...)ccc1-), there's a single bond to the third benzene's carbon.\n\nSo in the scaffold, the middle ring (n1cccc1) is connected via its carbon (position 5, perhaps) to the third benzene. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to draw it mentally.\n\nFirst benzene: c1cc(C)cc(C(=O)N)c1 (but removing substituents, it's c1ccccc1). Connected via a single bond to the N of the middle ring (n1c(...)). The middle ring after removing substituents is n1cccc1 (five-membered ring: N-C-C-C-C). Then connected via a single bond to the third benzene's carbon. The third benzene, after removing substituents, is c1ccccc1.\n\nSo the scaffold would be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1.c2cccc3-c3ccccc3. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The original SMILES is:\n\nCc1cc(C(N)=O)ccc1-n1c(CCC(=O)O)ccc1-c1ccc(-c2cnn(C)c2)cc1.\n\nAfter removing substituents, the first part becomes c1ccccc1 connected to n1cccc1 (middle ring), which is connected to c1ccccc1 (third benzene). But the connections are via single bonds. So the scaffold SMILES should be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2.\n\nWait, but the middle ring is a five-membered ring with N. So the correct SMILES would be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2. Let me check that. The first benzene is c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1, connected via a single bond to the third benzene c2ccccc2. But in the original structure, the middle ring is connected between the first and third benzene. So the correct order would be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccccc3. However, in SMILES notation, the single bond between the middle ring and the third benzene would be from which atom?\n\nAlternatively, the middle ring is n1cccc1, connected to the first benzene's carbon and the third benzene's carbon. So the entire structure would be c1ccccc1 connected to n1cccc1 connected to c2ccccc2. The way to write this in SMILES would be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccccc3. But I need to ensure proper ring numbering and closure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2. Yes, that seems right. Each ring is properly closed, with the middle ring (n2cccc2) connected via single bonds to the two benzene rings.\n\nSo the final Murcko scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(-n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2. Wait, but the middle ring is between the two benzene rings. Let me verify again. The original structure is first benzene connected to middle ring, which is connected to the third benzene. So the SMILES should be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2. But I'm not sure if the positions are correct. Alternatively, maybe it's c1ccccc1-n1cccc1-c1ccccc1. But SMILES requires unique numbering for each ring closure. So perhaps:\n\nThe first benzene is c1ccccc1, connected via a single bond to the middle ring (n2cccc2), which is connected via a single bond to the third benzene (c3ccccc3). So the entire SMILES would be c1ccccc1-n2cccc2-c3ccccc3. However, in SMILES notation, the hyphens indicate bonds between atoms. So writing c1ccccc1-n2cccc2-c3ccccc3 would mean the first benzene's last atom (c1) is bonded to n2 (the N in the middle ring), which is then bonded to c3 (the third benzene's first atom). But that might not capture the correct connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is to have the first benzene connected to the middle ring's N, and the middle ring's C connected to the third benzene. Let's break it down:\n\nThe original input's middle ring starts with n1c(...), so the N is part of the ring. The first benzene is connected to that N. Then the middle ring's last atom (before closing the ring) is a C, which is connected to the third benzene. So in the scaffold, the middle ring is n1cccc1. The first benzene is connected to the N (n1), and the middle ring's last C (position 5) is connected to the third benzene's C.\n\nSo the SMILES would be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2. Here, the first benzene (c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1) is connected via the N (n2) of the middle ring (n2cccc2), and the middle ring's last C (position 5) is connected to the third benzene (c2ccccc2) via a single bond. But wait, in the SMILES notation, the middle ring is n2cccc2, which implies the N is at position 1, followed by four Cs. The single bond from the first benzene's C to the N (n2) is correct. Then the middle ring's last C (position 5) is connected to the third benzene's C. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c3ccccc3. But how to represent the connection from the middle ring's C to the third benzene?\n\nAlternatively, after the middle ring's closure, the connection to the third benzene would be via one of the Cs. So the SMILES might be n2cccc2-c3ccccc3. So combining everything: c1ccc(n2cccc2-c3ccccc3)cc1. No, that's not right. It's better to write each part step by step.\n\nPerhaps the correct SMILES is c1ccc(-n2cccc2-c3ccccc3)cc1. But this might not correctly represent the connectivity. Alternatively, the scaffold is three separate rings connected by single bonds: benzene connected to a five-membered ring connected to another benzene. The correct SMILES would be c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2. Let me check with a SMILES parser if possible. \n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the SMILES: c1ccc(n2cccc2)cc1-c2ccccc2. However, the middle ring is five-membered with one N and four Cs, connected between the two benzene rings. This should be the correct Murcko scaffold after removing all substituents.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction problem. The input SMILES is O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1. First, I need to identify the rings and the connecting bonds.\n\nLooking at the structure, there are two main ring systems. The first part is c1ccccc1, which is a benzene ring. Attached to it via an NC bond is a C=CN group. Wait, but the benzene ring has a C(=O)O substituent. The other ring is c1cccs1, a thiophene ring (five-membered with sulfur). The thiophene is connected via a carbonyl group (C=O) to the rest.\n\nAccording to Murcko's definition, I need to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. So, the benzene ring's substituents like the carboxylic acid (C(=O)O) should be removed. The thiophene's carbonyl (O=C-) is also a side chain. The connecting bond between the benzene and the thiophene would be through the nitrogen in the NC group? Wait, the original structure is O=C(...) connected to the thiophene. Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nThe SMILES is O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1. Breaking it down: the central part is C=CN connected to the benzene (c1ccccc1) and the thiophene (c1cccs1) via the carbonyl groups. The benzene has a C(=O)O, which is a substituent. The thiophene is connected via the carbonyl (O=C-). So, the rings are benzene and thiophene. The connecting bonds would be the NC and the C=O? Wait, no. The connecting bonds between the rings. Let me draw the structure mentally.\n\nThe benzene ring (c1ccccc1) is attached via an N-C bond to a C=CH- group, which is connected to a carbonyl (O=C-), which is attached to the thiophene (c1cccs1). Additionally, the benzene has a C(=O)O group. The thiophene's other substituent is the O=C- group. So, the Murcko scaffold should retain the benzene and thiophene rings and the connecting bonds between them.\n\nBut how are they connected? The original structure has the benzene connected via NC=CH-C(=O)-thiophene. The connecting bonds would be the single bonds between the rings. Wait, but Murcko scaffolds include the ring systems and the linkers between them. So, the NC=CH-C(=O) part might be considered as a linker. But according to the definition, we remove side chains and exocyclic modifications. The linker between the two rings (benzene and thiophene) would be the NC=CH-C(=O). However, in Murcko's method, the scaffold is the ring systems plus any bridging atoms that connect them. Wait, maybe I need to check that.\n\nMurcko scaffold involves breaking all acyclic bonds, keeping only the ring systems and the bonds that connect them. So, any atoms that are part of a bridge between rings are kept. If the linker is a chain, it's removed. Wait, but sometimes the connecting chain is considered part of the scaffold if it's necessary to link the rings. For example, if there's a chain that connects two rings and is part of the core structure, like in bicyclic systems.\n\nIn this case, the benzene is connected via N-C=CH-C(=O)- to the thiophene. So the N is part of the benzene's ring? Wait, no. The benzene has an N attached as a substituent. The SMILES is c1ccccc1C(=O)O, which is a benzene with a carboxylic acid group. Then, the NC=CH is part of the side chain. The entire structure is O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1. So the main chain is the thiophene connected via a carbonyl to a CH2 group, which is connected via a double bond (C=CH) to an N, which is connected to the benzene ring (which has another carbonyl group).\n\nTo extract the scaffold, we need to remove all side chains. So, the benzene ring is part of the scaffold. The thiophene ring is another part. The connecting atoms between them would be the N and the carbonyl group? Or is the N part of a side chain?\n\nWait, perhaps the N is part of a chain connecting the two rings. The benzene ring has an N attached, which connects to the C=CH- group, which connects to the carbonyl, which connects to the thiophene. So the N, C=CH, and carbonyl are part of the connecting chain. Therefore, in the scaffold, we should only have the benzene and thiophene rings connected by the minimum necessary bonds. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the N is part of a ring? No, the benzene is a six-membered ring with substituents. The thiophene is a five-membered ring. The connecting atoms are in the chain. So, the Murcko scaffold would retain only the benzene and thiophene rings, and any bonds that directly connect them. However, in the original structure, they are connected via a chain of atoms (N-C=CH-C(=O)-), which is acyclic. Therefore, those atoms would be stripped away, leaving the two separate rings. But that can't be right because Murcko scaffolds usually link rings via the connecting bonds.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The Murcko scaffold is defined as the union of all rings and the linkers between them, but with all terminal side chains removed. The linkers are the atoms that connect two rings. So, in this case, the N-C=CH-C(=O)- might be considered a linker. So, the scaffold would include the benzene, the thiophene, and the atoms connecting them (N, C, C, O?), but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the linker is only the bonds between the rings. For example, if two rings are connected by a single bond, that bond is part of the scaffold. If they are connected by a chain of atoms, those atoms are considered part of the scaffold only if they form a bridge. Otherwise, they are considered side chains.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me refer back to the definition. The Murcko scaffold is obtained by removing all side chains, functional groups, and exocyclic modifications, leaving only the ring systems and connecting bonds. So, any atom that is not part of a ring or a connecting bond between rings is removed.\n\nIn the given SMILES, the benzene (c1ccccc1) and thiophene (c1cccs1) are the rings. The connecting path between them is through N-C=CH-C(=O)-. The question is whether those atoms (N, C, C, O) are part of the connecting bonds. Since they form a chain between the two rings, but are not part of any ring themselves, they would be considered side chains and thus removed. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would consist of the benzene and thiophene rings, but not connected, which doesn't make sense. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's look again. The SMILES is O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1. The main structure is a central carbonyl group (O=C-) attached to a chain: C=CN connected to the benzene ring (which has a C(=O)O substituent), and the other side of the carbonyl is attached to the thiophene ring. So the two rings are connected via a chain that includes the C=CN and the carbonyl. To form the Murcko scaffold, we need to retain the rings and any connecting bonds. If the connecting chain is considered a linker, then it should be kept. But according to the definition, side chains are removed, so perhaps the entire chain between the two rings is considered a side chain. Wait, but linkers between rings are part of the scaffold. The distinction is that side chains are branches off the main scaffold, while linkers are the main path connecting rings.\n\nIn this case, the two rings are connected via a chain of atoms. The Murcko scaffold would include those connecting atoms as part of the scaffold. But how? For example, if two benzene rings are connected by a methylene group (-CH2-), the scaffold includes the two benzenes and the CH2. So, in this case, the chain N-C=CH-C(=O)- would be part of the scaffold. But wait, that's a longer chain. Maybe only the atoms that are necessary to connect the rings are kept. However, according to the definition, the Murcko scaffold includes the ring systems and the connecting bonds. The connecting bonds would include any atoms that are part of the shortest path between the rings. So, perhaps in this case, the connecting path is N-C-C-O, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the entire chain is considered a linker and thus part of the scaffold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the actual scaffold is the two rings connected by a single bond if possible. But in this structure, they're connected via a chain. Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think of an example. For instance, if the molecule is benzene connected via a methyl group to another benzene, the scaffold would be the two benzenes connected by a single bond (if possible), but in reality, the methyl would be a side chain. Wait, no. If two benzene rings are connected by a -CH2-CH2- chain, the Murcko scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by a single bond, or would it include the CH2-CH2? According to the definition, it should leave the rings and connecting bonds. The connecting bonds would be the bonds that directly link the rings. So in the case of a chain between rings, only the bonds that are part of the rings are kept. Wait, but that would disconnect the rings. So perhaps the Murcko scaffold in that case would not connect them, but that's not correct. \n\nWait, maybe I need to use a tool or think of how Murcko scaffolds are typically generated. Murcko scaffolds are generated by removing all terminal atoms that are not part of a ring, recursively, until only rings and the connecting atoms remain. So, for example, in a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2-benzene, the Murcko scaffold would be benzene-benzene connected by a single bond (the two CH2 groups are removed as they are acyclic). Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the Murcko scaffold in that case would be the two benzene rings connected by the two CH2 groups, but that's a four-membered chain. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all rings and the bridge atoms between them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to convert the molecule into its framework by keeping all rings and the bonds that connect them. So, in the original SMILES, the benzene and thiophene are connected via a chain of atoms. Those atoms form a bridge between the two rings, so they should be part of the scaffold. But how to determine which atoms are part of the bridge. \n\nAlternatively, the Murcko scaffold is generated by removing all terminal atoms not part of a ring. So, you start by removing any terminal atoms (like the oxygen in the carboxylic acid group on the benzene). Then, recursively remove any atoms that become terminal. This process continues until only rings and the connecting atoms remain. \n\nLet's apply this to the input molecule. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O). The oxygen atoms here are terminal, so they get removed first. Then, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes a substituent, but once the O is removed, the C=O becomes a carbonyl attached to the benzene. But since the carbonyl is part of a chain leading to the thiophene, perhaps that's part of the scaffold. \n\nWait, maybe I should draw the structure step by step. The benzene ring (c1ccccc1) is connected to a carbon that has a double bond to O (C(=O)O). Removing the terminal O (from the carboxylic acid) leaves the C(=O) attached to the benzene. Then, the C=O is part of a chain connecting to the thiophene. But the C=O is attached to a CH group (C=CH-N...), which is part of a chain. Hmm. This is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, using a SMILES parser would help. Let's parse the SMILES: O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1. The central atom is the carbonyl carbon (O=C-). Attached to it are two groups: one is C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O, and the other is the thiophene (c1cccs1). The C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O part can be broken down as follows: the central C is connected via a double bond to another C, which is connected to N, which is connected to the benzene ring (c1ccccc1), which has a C(=O)O group. \n\nSo, the benzene ring has a substituent N, which is connected to a C=CH- group, which is connected to the central carbonyl. The other side of the carbonyl is connected to the thiophene. \n\nWhen generating the Murcko scaffold, we need to remove all substituents except the rings and the connecting bonds. The benzene's substituent is N connected to a chain. The thiophene's substituent is the carbonyl. The chain between the two rings is O=C-C=CH-N-.\n\nBut perhaps the Murcko scaffold would retain the benzene and thiophene rings, connected via the N and the carbonyl. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the connecting chain is considered part of the scaffold. So, the scaffold would be benzene connected via N-C=C-C(=O) to the thiophene. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the scaffold is benzene connected to thiophene via a single bond, but that's not present in the original structure. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that the Murcko scaffold is the union of all ring systems with all substituents removed. So, in this case, the benzene ring and the thiophene ring are the ring systems. The connecting atoms (N, C, C, O) are part of the side chains and are removed. Therefore, the scaffold would consist of the two separate rings. But that can't be right, because typically Murcko scaffolds retain the framework connecting the rings. \n\nWait, maybe I need to look for examples. For example, in the molecule CC1=CC=CN=C1C2=CC=CC=C2, the Murcko scaffold is the two rings connected by the single bond between the two aromatic rings. But if the rings are connected via a chain, like C1CCN(CC2CCCCC2)CC1, the scaffold would be the two rings connected by the N atom. \n\nIn the given problem, the two rings are connected via a chain that includes N, C=CH, and carbonyl. These atoms form a bridge between the rings. However, since they are acyclic, they might be considered as part of the side chains. Therefore, removing them would leave the two rings disconnected. But that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the two rings connected via the N and the carbonyl. But how? Let me think: the benzene is attached to N, which is attached to C=CH, which is attached to carbonyl, which is attached to the thiophene. If we remove the double bonds and side groups, maybe the scaffold is benzene-N-C-C(=O)-thiophene. But those atoms form a chain. Are they considered part of the scaffold? \n\nAccording to the definition, the Murcko scaffold includes ring systems and connecting bonds. Connecting bonds are the bonds that link the rings. So, if the rings are connected via a chain of atoms, those atoms are part of the scaffold. Therefore, the scaffold would be the two rings plus the connecting chain. But in this case, the chain is N-C-C-O. Wait, but the actual chain is N-C=C-C(=O)-. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the connecting chain is considered part of the scaffold if it's necessary to link the rings. So, the scaffold would include the benzene, the thiophene, and the atoms in between. \n\nBut how to represent that in SMILES. Let's try to build it. The benzene ring (c1ccccc1) is connected to N, which is connected to C (from the C=CH), then to C (from the carbonyl), which is connected to the thiophene. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccccc1NCC(=O)c2cccs2. But wait, that's including the N, C, C=O. But according to the definition, should those atoms be kept or removed? \n\nIf they are part of the connecting bonds, they should be kept. But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: using the RDKit's Murcko scaffold function. For example, if I process the input SMILES, the Murcko scaffold would be the rings and the connecting atoms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the benzene ring fused with the thiophene via some connecting atoms. But in this case, they are not fused. \n\nWait, the input molecule's scaffold: the benzene and thiophene rings connected via a chain of atoms. The Murcko scaffold should include those connecting atoms. Therefore, the scaffold would be c1ccccc1N=C(C)c2cccs2. Wait, but that's not accurate. Let's parse the original SMILES again. \n\nOriginal SMILES: O=C(C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O)c1cccs1. The central carbonyl (O=C-) is attached to two groups: one is C=CNc1ccccc1C(=O)O, and the other is the thiophene. The C=CN part is a chain: C double bond to C, then single bond to N, which is connected to the benzene. \n\nIf we remove the substituents (the carboxylic acid O, the double bonds might be part of the scaffold). So the scaffold would be benzene connected via N-C-C=O to the thiophene. But how? The connecting chain would be N-C-C=O. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1NC=C(O)c2cccs2. But wait, the original structure has the carbonyl between the C and the thiophene. So the connecting part is C=CN-C(=O)-. \n\nThis is getting too confusing without visualizing the structure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to the best of my understanding. The Murcko scaffold should retain the benzene and thiophene rings and the connecting atoms necessary to link them. The connecting atoms are N, C, C, O. But since the O is part of a carbonyl group (a functional group), it might be removed. So perhaps the scaffold is the benzene connected via NC-C to the thiophene. But I'm not certain. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the two rings connected via the N and the adjacent carbons. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1NCCc2cccs2. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the connecting chain is simplified to a single bond. In that case, the SMILES would be c1ccccc1Nc2cccs2. But that would imply a direct bond between the benzene's N and the thiophene, which isn't the case. \n\nWait, in the original structure, the benzene's substituent is N connected to C=CH-C(=O)-thiophene. The Murcko scaffold would require removing the C=CH and the carbonyl, leaving the benzene connected via N to the thiophene. But that's not correct because there's no direct bond. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to use a tool. However, since I can't do that, I'll make an educated guess. The Murcko scaffold for the given SMILES should be the benzene ring and the thiophene ring connected via the N and the carbonyl group. Therefore, the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2cccs2. Let's check: the benzene (c1ccccc1) connected to N, then C(=O), then the thiophene (c2cccs2). That seems to retain the rings and the connecting carbonyl and N. But wait, in the original structure, the N is connected to a C=CH group, which is connected to the carbonyl. So perhaps the connecting chain is N-C-C(=O), which would be retained as part of the scaffold. \n\nHowever, the definition says to remove all side chains and exocyclic modifications. The N is attached to the benzene ring (exocyclic), so that would be a substituent. Similarly, the carbonyl is exocyclic to the thiophene. Therefore, both should be removed, leaving just the two rings. But that would result in two separate rings, which doesn't seem right. \n\nI think I'm stuck here, but I have to make a decision. Based on similar examples, the Murcko scaffold for this molecule would likely be the benzene and thiophene rings connected via the N and the carbonyl group. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cccs2)cc1. Wait, but the original benzene is connected to N via a single bond. So the scaffold would be c1ccccc1 connected to N, which is connected to C(=O), which is connected to the thiophene. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2cccs2. Let me check the connectivity. In the original SMILES, the N is part of the side chain attached to the benzene. So in the scaffold, the N would remain attached to the benzene, and the carbonyl would remain attached to the thiophene. Therefore, the scaffold would be benzene-N-C(=O)-thiophene. \n\nBut in the original structure, the N is part of the chain between the benzene and the thiophene. So the scaffold would include that N and the carbonyl as connecting atoms. Therefore, the correct scaffold SMILES is c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2cccs2. \n\nYes, that seems plausible. Let me verify. The original molecule has the benzene connected via N-C=CH-C(=O)- to the thiophene. The Murcko scaffold removes the C=CH (side chain), leaving N-C(=O) as the connecting atoms. Therefore, the scaffold is benzene-N-C(=O)-thiophene. \n\nBut wait, the carbonyl is part of the connecting chain. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2cccs2. That makes sense. The rings are connected via the N and the carbonyl group. The exocyclic groups like the carboxylic acid on the benzene and the oxygen in the carbonyl might be considered part of the scaffold? No, the carboxylic acid (C(=O)O) is a substituent and should be removed. The carbonyl (C=O) connecting the two rings is part of the scaffold. \n\nSo the final answer should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc(NC(=O)c2cccs2)cc1\"}? Or \"c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2cccs2\"? Let me check the SMILES syntax. The benzene ring is c1ccccc1, connected to N. Then NC(=O)c2cccs2. So the SMILES would be c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2cccs2. Yes, that's correct.",

The main structure has a benzene ring (c1cc...c1). Then there's another ring attached via a connecting bond. Wait, looking at the c1cc2cnc... part, maybe there's a fused ring here. The 'c2' suggests a second ring fused to the first benzene. Let me parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nThe core starts with N#C (cyano group) attached to the benzene. But according to the definition, side chains and functional groups should be removed. So the cyano (N#C) is a functional group and needs to be removed. Similarly, the ketone (=O) on the benzene is another functional group\u2014remove that too.\n\nLooking at the substituents on the rings: The benzene ring (c1) has a cyano group and a ketone. The other ring (c2) is part of a fused system? Let me check the connectivity. The SMILES is c1cc2cnc(...)nc2n(...)c1=O. So ring 1 is c1 connected to c2, which forms part of ring 2. Then there's a connecting bond between the two rings via the nitrogen? Or maybe it's a fused ring system. Wait, the 'c1cc2...nc2...c1' suggests that ring 2 is a fused ring attached to ring 1. So the two rings are fused together, forming a bicyclic system.\n\nThen, looking at the substituents on the rings: There's an NCc3ccccc3 group attached via the cnc(...) part. That's an aniline (NH connected to a benzene), which is a side chain\u2014remove it. Also, the n(C2CCCC2) is a substituent on the nitrogen\u2014the cyclohexyl group (C2CCCC2) is a side chain, so that gets removed too.\n\nSo stripping all side chains and functional groups: Remove the cyano (N#C), the ketone (=O), the NCc3ccccc3, and the cyclohexyl (C2CCCC2) substituents. What remains is the fused ring system: the benzene ring fused with another ring (possibly a pyrimidine-like ring? Since there are nitrogens in the c2cnc...nc2 part. Let me count the atoms in the second ring. The sequence is c2cnc(...)nc2. So the second ring has 6 atoms: two carbons, two nitrogens, then two carbons? Wait, the exact arrangement would be c2 connected to c, then n, c, etc. Maybe it's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. So the fused rings are benzene and a diazine ring.\n\nSo the Murcko scaffold would be the two fused rings without any substituents. The original structure after removal would be c1cc2cncnc2nc1. Wait, let's reconstruct: The original SMILES after removing substituents would be c1cc2cnc(nc2n)c1. Wait, maybe not. Let me try to write it step by step. The core rings are connected via the c1 and c2. The original SMILES has c1 connected to c2, then the c2 ring is part of a fused system. After removing all substituents, the scaffold would be the fused benzene and the other ring, connected by the bonds. Let me check if the connecting bonds between the rings are retained. The definition says to keep ring systems and connecting bonds. So any bonds that connect different rings are kept.\n\nSo the main scaffold would be the two fused rings. Let me try to write the SMILES. The original structure had c1cc2cnc(...)nc2n(...)c1=O. After removing substituents and functional groups, the rings are c1cc2cncnc2n c1. Wait, but the ketone was on c1, so removing =O, the c1 becomes just c. The cyclohexyl group on the nitrogen is removed, so the nitrogen in n(C2CCCC2) becomes just n. Similarly, the NCc3ccccc3 is removed from the cnc part, so that becomes cnc. Putting it all together: the scaffold SMILES would be c1cc2cncnc2nc1. Let me validate that. The benzene ring (c1cc...) fused with a pyrimidine-like ring (c2cncnc2). Hmm, but the exact arrangement of the nitrogens matters. Let me count the atoms in the second ring. The sequence is c2 connected to c, n, c, n, c, and back to c2. So that's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens at positions 2 and 4. So the fused rings would be benzene (6-membered) fused to a 6-membered ring with two nitrogens. The connecting bonds are part of the fused system, so they're retained.\n\nTherefore, the Murcko scaffold should be c1cc2cncnc2nc1. Wait, but in the original SMILES, the second ring has the sequence cnc(NC...)nc2n(...). After removing the substituents, it's cnc nc2n. Wait, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1cc2cnc(nc2n)c1. Let me check the connectivity again. The original SMILES is N#Cc1cc2cnc(NC...)nc2n(C...)c1=O. The core rings are c1 (positions 1-6) and c2 (positions 2-7?), but maybe the exact numbering is different. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is c1ccc2cncnc2n1. Let me use a SMILES generator to check. Alternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1cc2c(nc1)nc[nH]c2. Wait, but without hydrogens. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1cc2cncnc2nc1. Let me see: the benzene ring (c1cc...) fused to a pyrimidine ring (c2cnc...nc2). Yes, that seems right. So the final SMILES is c1cc2cncnc2nc1.",

The molecule has two main rings. The first part is a benzene-like ring: there's a six-membered ring with NH and Cl substituents. Wait, the first ring is written as c1[nH]c2ccc(Cl)cc2c1. So, that's a bicyclic system? Let me parse that. The first atom is a carbon (from Cc1...), then a nitrogen with a hydrogen ([nH]), connected to another ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2). So that's a fused ring system\u2014maybe a quinoline or similar? The second part is the -c1ccnc(N2CCCC2)n1. This ring has a nitrogen in the ring (the 'n'), so that's a five-membered ring, possibly a pyridine or pyrrole derivative. The substituents here are a methyl group (the initial C in Cc1...), chlorine (Cl), and an N-cyclopropyl group (N2CCCC2). \n\nAccording to Murcko's definition, I need to remove all side chains and functional groups. So, the methyl group (C attached to the first ring), the chlorine (Cl), and the cyclopropyl amine (N2CCCC2) are all side chains or substituents. The connecting bond between the two rings (the - between c1 and c1) remains as part of the scaffold. \n\nSo, stripping away those substituents: the first fused ring system would be the benzene ring fused to another ring (maybe a pyridine?), but without the methyl and chlorine. Wait, the first ring is c1[nH]c2ccc(...)cc2c1. If we remove the Cl, that part becomes c1[nH]c2cccc2c1. Then the second ring is c1ccnc(...)n1. Removing the N2CCCC2 substituent, that becomes c1ccncn1. So the two rings are the fused bicyclic system (maybe like a quinoline without substituents) and the pyrimidine-like ring? Wait, the second ring is c1ccnc...n1. Let me count: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The 'n' is at position 3 and 5? Or maybe the ring is five-membered. Let me draw it out mentally. The SMILES is c1ccnc(N...)n1. So the ring is five atoms: positions 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (N), 4 (C), 5 (N). Wait, no: the SMILES notation is c1ccnc(...)n1. The ring closure is at the end. So the sequence is C1 connected to C2, C3, N4, C5, then the N1 closes the ring. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring? No, the indices are 1 for the ring. Let me parse the second part: -c1ccnc(N2CCCC2)n1. The ring starts with c1 (carbon), then c, c, n (nitrogen), c (with a substituent N2...), and then n1 to close the ring. So that's a five-membered ring: C-C-C-N-C, but the last C is connected back to the first C via the n1 closure? Wait, no. SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to indicate closures. So the first atom is c1, then after some atoms, when you reach n1, that connects back to the first c1. So in the second ring: c1 (position 1), c (position 2), c (3), n (4), c (5) with substituent, and then n1 (position 6?), but wait, the ring is closed at the n1. Hmm, maybe it's a five-membered ring: positions 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (N), 5 (C), and then closing back to position 1 with the n1. Wait, that would make a five-membered ring: 1-2-3-4-5-1. But the SMILES is c1ccnc(...)n1. So after the first c1, there's c, c, n, c, and then n1. That's five atoms, so a five-membered ring. So the ring is C-C-C-N-C, connected back to the first C. But nitrogen in position 4 and the last C is position 5. Then, the substituent is on the c in position 5 (the N2CCCC2 part). So removing that substituent, the ring becomes c1ccncn1? Wait, no. If the original is c1ccnc(N...)n1, removing the N... substituent would leave c1ccncn1. Wait, but the fifth atom is a carbon connected to the substituent. So stripping that, it's just c connected to nothing else. So the ring becomes c1ccnc[nH]1? No, because the substituent was an amine. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is to remove all substituents except the rings and connecting bonds. So for the second ring, the substituent is the N2CCCC2 (which is a pyrrolidine ring?), but that's a side chain. So the scaffold would have the five-membered ring with two nitrogens, but without the substituent. So the SMILES for that ring would be c1cnccn1? Or c1ccncn1? Let me check the order. The original is c1ccnc(N...)n1. So positions: 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (N), 5 (C connected to N...), and then back to 1 via n1. Wait, no. The closure is at n1, which refers back to position 1. So the ring is c1 (position1) followed by c (2), c (3), n (4), c (5) with substituent, then n (position6?) but the n1 refers back to position1. That would make a six-membered ring? Wait, no, because the indices are 1-based. So the SMILES is c1ccnc(N...)n1. Breaking it down:\n\n- c1: start of ring, position1 (carbon)\n- c: position2 (carbon)\n- c: position3 (carbon)\n- n: position4 (nitrogen)\n- c: position5 (carbon), which has the substituent (N2CCCC2)\n- n1: position6 (nitrogen), which connects back to position1.\n\nSo that's a six-membered ring: positions 1-6 are C, C, C, N, C, N. So the ring is C-C-C-N-C-N. But that would create a six-membered ring with two nitrogens. Wait, but the actual structure would depend on the bonding. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me think of the SMILES as c1 (C1), then c (C2), c (C3), n (N4), c (C5), n1 (N6 connected back to C1). So the ring is C1-C2-C3-N4-C5-N6-C1. That's a six-membered ring with two nitrogens at positions 4 and 6. So the scaffold would have that ring without the substituent on C5 (the N2CCCC2 part). So the SMILES for this ring would be c1ccc(N)nc1? No, wait. The original substituent is on the C5 (the fifth atom in the ring), which is the carbon between N4 and N6. So removing that substituent, the ring becomes c1ccncn1. Let me write that as c1ccncn1. So combining the two rings: the first fused ring system and the second ring connected via a single bond.\n\nThe first part of the SMILES is Cc1[nH]c2ccc(Cl)cc2c1. The fused rings here are a benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2) fused to a ring containing the [nH]. Let me parse that. The first ring is c1 (the main ring index), which starts with C (from Cc1...), then [nH] (so a nitrogen with a hydrogen), then c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (which is a benzene ring with Cl), then back to c1. So the fused rings are a five-membered ring (since c1 has five atoms?) or a six-membered? Wait, the first ring (index1) is: C (from Cc1), [nH], then the benzene ring (index2). Wait, maybe it's a bicyclic system where the nitrogen is part of both rings. For example, in indole, the five-membered ring is fused to a benzene. Here, perhaps the nitrogen is in a five-membered ring fused to a benzene. So the first fused ring system would be the bicyclic structure. So stripping the substituents (methyl and Cl), the fused rings would be c1ncc2ccccc2c1. Wait, but the original has [nH], so maybe after removing the methyl and Cl, the NH remains as part of the ring. So the first scaffold part would be c1[nH]c2ccccc2c1. But according to Murcko, functional groups like NH should be removed. Wait, the definition says to remove functional groups. Is the [nH] considered a functional group or part of the ring? The Murcko scaffold retains the ring atoms and connecting bonds but removes substituents. So if the NH is part of the ring (as in pyrrole), it stays. If it's a substituent (like an amino group attached to a benzene), it's removed. In this case, the [nH] is part of the ring, so it remains. Similarly, the Cl is a substituent on the benzene ring, so it's removed. The methyl group (Cc1...) is a substituent, so removed. So the first fused ring becomes n1c2ccccc2c1. Wait, but the SMILES would be c1ncc2ccccc2c1. Let me reconstruct: the original is Cc1[nH]c2ccc(Cl)cc2c1. Removing the methyl (C), the Cl, and keeping the rings. So the first ring (index1) starts with c1 (now without the methyl), then [nH], then c2 (from c2ccc...), then the benzene ring (without Cl: cccccc), and back to c1. So the fused rings would be c1ncc2ccccc2c1. Wait, but the actual connectivity might be different. Alternatively, the fused rings could be represented as c1c2ccccc2ncc1. Not sure. Maybe the correct SMILES is c1cc2ccccc2n1. But I need to ensure proper ring closures. Alternatively, using a tool would help, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps the correct scaffold for the first part is c1cnc2ccccc12 (which is a quinoline-like structure without substituents). Then the second ring is c1ccncn1. The two rings are connected by a single bond (the \"-\" in the original SMILES between the two c1s). So the final scaffold would be the fused ring connected via a single bond to the six-membered ring with two nitrogens. Wait, the original SMILES has the two rings connected by a single bond: the first ring ends with c1- and the second starts with c1. So the two ring systems are connected by a single bond. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold should retain that bond. So putting it all together: the fused bicyclic system (without methyl and Cl) connected via a single bond to the six-membered ring (without the cyclopropyl amine substituent). So the fused rings would be c1cnc2ccccc12 (quinoline scaffold) and the six-membered ring c1ccncn1. Wait, but the second ring in the original is six-membered with two nitrogens. Let me recheck. The original second ring is c1ccnc(N2CCCC2)n1. After removing the substituent N2CCCC2, it becomes c1ccncn1. So that's a six-membered ring: C-C-C-N-C-N. So the SMILES is c1ccncn1. Then the two rings are connected by a single bond. So the entire scaffold is the fused quinoline-like ring (c1cnc2ccccc12) connected via a single bond to c1ccncn1. So combining them: c1cnc2ccccc12-c1ccncn1. But wait, the original SMILES has the first ring as Cc1[nH]c2ccc(Cl)cc2c1-..., which after removing substituents becomes c1[nH]c2ccccc2c1. Wait, maybe the correct SMILES for the first ring is c1c2ccccc2nc1. Let me think again. The original first part: Cc1[nH]c2ccc(Cl)cc2c1. The c1 is a ring that starts with C (from Cc1), then [nH], then c2 (which starts the benzene ring), then the benzene (ccc(Cl)cc2), then back to c1. So the fused rings are a five-membered ring (since the first ring has atoms: C, nH, c2, c (from c2), c (from cc2), and back to C). Wait, no. The first ring (index1) has the following atoms: C (from Cc1), [nH], c2 (which is part of the second ring), then after the benzene ring (index2), it returns to c1. So the first ring is actually three atoms: C, nH, c2, then through the benzene ring (index2) which has six atoms, and back to the first ring. This is getting confusing. Maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, consider that the first ring is a five-membered ring fused to a benzene. For example, the structure is similar to indole: a five-membered ring with NH fused to benzene. The original SMILES for the first part is Cc1[nH]c2ccc(Cl)cc2c1. Removing substituents (C and Cl), it becomes c1[nH]c2ccccc2c1. So the fused rings are c1c2ccccc2ncc1. Wait, maybe that's indole's scaffold: n1ccc2ccccc12. So the SMILES would be c1ccc2ccccc2n1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the correct scaffold for the first part after removing substituents is c1cnc2ccccc12. Then, the second part is c1ccncn1 connected by a single bond. So combining them: c1cnc2ccccc12-c1ccncn1. Let me check valence. Each ring should be properly closed. The final answer should have the rings connected by a single bond, with all side chains removed. So I think the correct Murcko scaffold SMILES is c1c(Sc2ccccc2)cnc2ccncn12. No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cnc2ccccc2c1-c1ccncn1. Yes, that makes sense: the fused quinoline-like ring connected via a single bond to the six-membered ring with two nitrogens. So the final JSON should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1cnc2ccccc2c1-c1ccncn1\"}.",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, let's tackle this Murcko scaffold extraction. The input SMILES is CN(Cc1ccco1)c1nc(-c2cccc(C#N)c2)nc2ccccc12. First, I need to identify all the rings and the connecting bonds.\n\nStarting with the structure, the main part is probably the central ring. Let's parse the SMILES. The central part seems to be the 'c1nc...nc2ccccc12' part. That looks like a bicyclic system, maybe a fused ring. The 'c1nc' starts a ring, then 'nc2ccccc12' suggests a benzene ring fused to another ring.\n\nNow, the substituents: there's a CN group attached to a CH2 group (Cc1ccco1), which is a cyclopentene or similar. Also, there's a '-c2cccc(C#N)c2' group, which is a benzene ring with a cyano substituent. These are likely side chains or functional groups.\n\nSo, removing all side chains. The central scaffold would be the fused bicyclic system without the substituents. The main rings are the benzene ring fused with another ring (maybe a pyridine or similar). The connecting bonds between the rings should stay.\n\nLet me draw this mentally. The core is the two fused rings: the benzene and a heterocyclic ring with two nitrogens. The substituents like the CN groups, the CH2-cyclopentene, and the cyano benzene are all side chains. So stripping those off, the scaffold should be the fused rings connected by any bridge bonds.\n\nPutting it into SMILES: The central part is c1nc2ccccc2n1. Wait, the original SMILES has 'c1nc(-c2...)nc2ccccc12'. If I remove the substituents on the nitrogens, the scaffold would be the fused ring system. The nitrogens are part of the rings, so the scaffold is c1ncc2ccccc12 with the connecting bonds. Wait, maybe the actual structure is a benzimidazole or similar. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal SMILES: Breaking it down. The central part is 'c1nc(...)nc2ccccc12'. So the first ring is a 5-membered ring? Or maybe a 6-membered ring. Wait, the 'c1nc' starts with position 1, then 'nc2ccccc12' connects to position 2. So the rings are fused: the first ring is positions 1, 2 (nitrogen), then fused to the benzene ring (positions 2,3,4,5,6,1). So the core is a benzimidazole-like structure. But the exact SMILES would be c1nc2ccccc2n1. Let me verify.\n\nYes, the central part after removing substituents would be the benzimidazole fused to a benzene ring. Wait, no. Let me parse the indices again. The SMILES is written as 'c1nc(-c2...)nc2ccccc12'. The first ring is c1 (atom 1), then n (atom 2), c (atom 3) connected to a substituent. Then another n (atom 4) connected to another substituent, then c2 (atom 5) starting the benzene ring (positions 5,6,7,8,9,10,5). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe using a tool would help, but since I can't, I'll have to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the scaffold is the fused rings without any substituents. The main rings are the benzene (from the 'ccccc') and a smaller ring connected via the nitrogens. The substituents like -C(N)(C...) and the -c... parts are all side chains. So removing those, the scaffold would be the bicyclic system: a benzene fused to a ring containing two nitrogens. The SMILES would be c1ccccc1 connected to the other ring. Wait, perhaps the core is c1cnc2ccccc12. Let me check valency. If it's c1cnc2ccccc12, that forms a 6-5 fused system. Carbon 1 is part of both rings. But the original has two nitrogens. The original SMILES has 'c1nc(...)nc2...'. So the two nitrogens are in the same ring? That would make a 5-membered ring: c1ncnc2ccccc12? Wait, maybe the central ring is a 5-membered ring with two nitrogens. For example, a pyrazole or imidazole fused to benzene.\n\nLet me reconstruct. The central part is c1nc(...)nc2ccccc12. The first ring is positions 1 (C), 2 (N), 3 (C), 4 (N), 5 (C), then fused to the benzene. Wait, that would make a 5-membered ring with two nitrogens, fused to a benzene. So the scaffold would be the 5 and 6 membered rings fused together. The SMILES for that would be c1ncc2ccccc2n1. Or maybe c1nc2ccccc2n1. Let me check the connectivity. The first ring is c1 (atom 1), n (atom 2), c (atom 3), then another n (atom 4), c (atom 5), and back to atom 1. That's a 5-membered ring: 1-2-3-4-5-1. Then the benzene is fused at atoms 3 and 4? Or maybe the benzene is connected via atom 3. Wait, the original SMILES has 'nc2ccccc12' at the end. So the 'c2ccccc12' part is a benzene where c2 is connected to the previous n. So the benzene is fused to the 5-membered ring. So the structure is a 5-membered ring (with two nitrogens) fused to a benzene. The SMILES would be c1nc2ccccc2n1. Let me confirm: the 5-membered ring is c1-n-c2-c-c-n1? No, perhaps c1(nc2ccccc2n1). Hmm, maybe the correct SMILES is c1nc2ccccc2n1. That would form a 5-membered ring (positions 1,2,3,4,5) where 1 is C, 2 is N, 3 is C connected to benzene (positions 3,6,7,8,9,10,6), making a fused system. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzimidazole scaffold, which is a benzene fused to an imidazole ring. Benzimidazole's SMILES is c1ccc2[nH]cnc2c1, but in this case, the nitrogens might be in different positions. But in the input, the nitrogens are part of the core rings. So after removing substituents, the scaffold would be the fused rings with the nitrogens. So the SMILES would be c1nc2ccccc2n1. Checking the valency: each atom should have correct valence. Carbon in the rings should have two double bonds or single bonds as needed. Let me count: in c1nc2ccccc2n1, the first ring is c1-n-c2-c-c-n1, which is 5 members. The benzene is c2 connected to cccccc. Wait, maybe the correct scaffold is c1ncc2ccccc2c1. No, perhaps I'm getting the indices wrong. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is c12c(nc(n1)c3ccccc3). No, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to write the SMILES properly. The original molecule has a central core that's a bicyclic system. The substituents are the parts attached to the nitrogens and the carbons. Removing all substituents, the remaining structure is the two fused rings. The SMILES should thus be the core rings. In the input, after the substituents are removed, the core would be the part where the nitrogens are in the rings. So the correct Murcko scaffold is probably c1nc2ccccc2n1. Let me check with an example. Benzimidazole is c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]cn2. But in this case, the structure might be different. Alternatively, the scaffold is a benzene ring fused to a pyrimidine-like ring. Another approach: look for all rings in the molecule and the connecting bonds. The input has multiple rings: the cyclopentene (from Cc1ccco1), the benzene with cyano (c2cccc(C#N)c2), and the central bicyclic system. The Murcko scaffold should retain only the central bicyclic system, which is the largest ring system with connecting bonds. So the answer is {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1nc2ccccc2n1\"}.",

First, I need to identify the ring systems and connecting bonds.\n\nLooking at the structure, there's a benzene ring (from the 'c1cc...' part) with some methoxy groups (OCH3). According to the definition, those are functional groups, so they should be removed. That means stripping off the OCH3 groups from the benzene ring.\n\nNext, there's another ring connected via the 'cc2' part. The main rings are probably the benzene and a bicyclic system. The substituents like the amide groups (N...) and the ketone (O) on the other rings might be exocyclic. The side chains like the ethyl or propyl groups attached to nitrogen or oxygen should also be removed.\n\nSo, after removing all the side chains and functional groups, the core scaffold would consist of the benzene ring fused or connected to another ring system. Let me check the connecting bonds. The original structure has a bridge between the two rings, possibly through the CC2 and CC1 parts. Retaining the rings and the bridging bonds without substituents should give the Murcko scaffold.\n\nPutting it all together, the benzene ring (without OCH3) is connected to a bridged ring system. The final scaffold SMILES would be c1cc2c(cc1)C3CCCN3CC2. Wait, but maybe the exact connectivity needs careful checking. Let me visualize. The benzene (c1cc2c(cc1)...) is connected to a bridged bicyclic system. After removing the substituents, the rings and the bridge remain. So the correct SMILES should represent the fused rings and bridges without any branches. Perhaps c1cc2c(cc1)C3CCCN3CC2, but I need to ensure all side chains are stripped. Let me confirm again: the original molecule has a benzene with two methoxy groups (removed), then a bridge to another ring with various substituents (N groups, etc.), which are all removed. The core is the benzene fused to a bridged bicyclic system. So the scaffold SMILES should be c1cc2c(cc1)C3CCCCN3CC2. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the numbers. Alternatively, the correct Murcko scaffold is c1cc2c(cc1)C3CCCNC3CC2. Hmm, perhaps I should reconstruct the SMILES step by step. The benzene ring is c1ccc2... then the bridge is C3... maybe. Alternatively, using a more accurate approach, the final scaffold would be the rings and the connecting bonds. Let me think again. The main rings are the benzene and the bridged cyclohexane (or similar) connected via a single bond. After removing all substituents, the scaffold is the two rings connected by a bridge. The correct SMILES would be c1cc2c(cc1)C3CCCCN3CC2. Wait, but perhaps the nitrogen is part of the ring. If the original structure has a ring with N, then that nitrogen remains. But in the original SMILES, there's a part like C1CC(N)... which suggests that the nitrogen was a substituent, so it should be removed. Therefore, the rings would be all carbon. So the bridge would be between the benzene and another ring. Let me try again: the benzene ring (c1cc2c(cc1)) connected to a bridged system. The bridged part after removing substituents would be C1CCCCN1, but without the N's substituents. Wait, the original SMILES has C1CC(N)C(...)CN1. So removing the N's substituents (like the NH2 and the other groups), the ring becomes C1CCCN1. So combining, the scaffold is c1cc2c(cc1)C3CCCN3CC2. Let me check if that makes sense. Yes, the benzene connected to a bridged ring system (three-membered ring? No, maybe a six-membered with a bridge). Alternatively, perhaps the correct SMILES is c1cc2c(cc1)C3CCCC3CC2. I might need to verify with a structure drawing tool, but given the constraints, I'll go with c1cc2c(cc1)C3CCCN3CC2 as the scaffold, ensuring that all substituents are removed and only the ring systems and connecting bonds remain.",

The molecule has two rings: a benzene ring (c1ccc2...) connected via an oxygen? Wait, looking closer, the SMILES is c1cc(=O)oc2cc... so the first ring might be a five-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone group. Then there's a second benzene ring (c2ccc12), which is fused? Wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nBreaking it down: The SMILES starts with Cc1cc(=O)oc2cc(...)ccc12. So, the first part is a methyl group (C) attached to a ring atom 1. Then atoms 2, 3, 4 (with =O), oxygen, and atom 5 (which is connected to ring 2). The second ring is c2cc(NC(=O)...)ccc12, so atoms 1 and 2 are shared between the two rings. So, the core is a bicyclic system where two rings are fused. The first ring is a five-membered ring (since it's c1cc(=O)oc2...), including an oxygen and a ketone. Wait, no, the first ring is actually a six-membered ring if I count correctly. Wait, the SMILES is c1cc(=O)oc2cc... Let me count the atoms in the first ring. Atom 1 is connected to C (methyl), then atoms 2, 3 (with =O), oxygen (atom 4?), then atom 5 connected to the second ring. Wait, maybe it's a five-membered ring? Because the connectivity is 1-2-3-4-O-...? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the first ring is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. Let me draw it out mentally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first ring is a five-membered ring: positions 1 (C), 2 (c), 3 (c=O), 4 (o), and 5 (c connected to the second ring). Then the second ring is a benzene ring (positions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the two rings are fused as in a benzofuran or similar. The key is to remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. The methyl (Cc1...), the ketone (=O), the Br in the side chain (Cc3ccc(Br)cc3), the amide group (NC(=O)...). So removing all those, the scaffold should be the fused ring system without substituents. So the rings are the bicyclic system without the methyl, ketone, Br, amide, etc. So the Murcko scaffold would be the fused rings with the connecting bonds. Let me check the original SMILES again: the core is the two fused rings. The first ring has an oxygen and a ketone as substituents? Wait, the =O is on the first ring, so that's a functional group. So we need to remove that. Similarly, the oxygen in the ring is part of the ring structure, so it's kept. Wait, no, the rings include the heteroatoms. So the rings are c1ccoc2ccc... Wait, the original SMILES is c1cc(=O)oc2cc... So the first ring is c1 connected to c2 (with =O), then o, then c connected to the second ring. Wait, maybe the first ring is five-membered: c1, c, c(=O), o, and then back to the first atom? No, SMILES notation requires that the ring closure numbers match. Let's parse the SMILES step by step.\n\nOriginal SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)oc2cc(NC(=O)Cc3ccc(Br)cc3)ccc12.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first part is C (methyl) connected to atom 1 (c1).\n- Atom 1 is connected to c2 (atom 2), which is connected to c3 (atom 3) with =O.\n- Then o (oxygen) connected to c4 (atom 4), which is part of the second ring (c2cc...). Wait, the second ring closure is ccc12, meaning atom 1 is connected to atom 2 of the second ring. Wait, maybe the two rings are fused: the first ring is atoms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (with O), and the second ring is atoms 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, forming a bicyclic system. Alternatively, perhaps the first ring is a five-membered ring (1,2,3,4,5) where 5 is the oxygen, and then the second ring is six-membered (1,5,6,7,8,9), making a fused system like benzofuran but with a ketone. But the ketone (=O) is on atom 3, which is part of the first ring. That would be a substituent, so in the Murcko scaffold, we remove that. Similarly, the oxygen in the ring is part of the ring structure, so it remains. So the scaffold would be the fused rings without substituents. So the first ring (five-membered) would be c1ccoc... but without the =O. Wait, but the =O is on atom 3 of the first ring. So the original first ring has a carbonyl group. So removing that substituent, the first ring would become c1ccoc, but wait, the oxygen is part of the ring. So the five-membered ring would be c1c(-O-)c... Wait, the actual ring atoms are c1, c2, c3 (with =O), O, and c5 connected back to c1? Wait, no. The SMILES is c1cc(=O)oc2... So the ring closure is 1 and 2. Let me try to write the rings properly. The first ring is c1 followed by cc(=O)o, then connected to c2, which is part of the second ring. The ring closures are ccc12, meaning atom 1 is connected to atom 2 of the second ring. So the first ring is c1 connected to c2, which is connected to c3 (=O), then o (O), then c4 connected to c2 (from the second ring's closure). Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe the core structure is a bicyclic system where the first ring is a five-membered ring (including an oxygen atom) fused to a benzene ring. The substituents like methyl, ketone, Br, amide, etc., are all side chains or functional groups to be removed. So the Murcko scaffold would be the fused bicyclic system without any substituents. So the SMILES would be O1c2ccccc2c3c1ccc3. Wait, no, perhaps it's O=C is part of the ring? No, because in the original SMILES, the =O is on a carbon in the ring. So removing that substituent, the ring would have a double bond? Wait, no. The Murcko scaffold removes all substituents but keeps the rings and connecting bonds. So if the ring has a carbonyl group (as in =O), that's a substituent and should be removed. Wait, but the connecting bonds are the single bonds that link rings. So in the original molecule, the rings are connected via a single bond or fused. For example, if there's a fused ring system, that's part of the scaffold. Any substituents on the rings, like methyl, ketone, etc., are removed. So in this case, the two fused rings (one might be a furan-like ring fused to a benzene) with the connecting bonds. The original rings would have oxygen in one of them (from the 'o' in the SMILES). So the scaffold would be the fused rings without any substituents. Let me try to reconstruct it. The original rings: the first ring is five-membered with an oxygen, and the second is a six-membered benzene ring fused to it. So the scaffold would be O1C2C=CC=C2C3=CC=CC=C13 (but that's probably incorrect). Alternatively, the correct scaffold would be the fused rings without substituents. Let me try to write the SMILES. The original has c1cc(=O)oc2cc... So after removing substituents, the first ring is c1ccc(O)c2... but without the =O. Wait, no. The =O is a substituent on a ring carbon. So removing that, the ring would have a single bond instead. So the first ring would be c1ccoc... So the SMILES for the scaffold would be c1ccoc2ccccc12. But wait, the original has c1cc(=O)oc2... So when we remove the =O, the carbon becomes just c. So the first ring is c1ccoc2... Then the second ring is c2ccccc12. So combining them, the scaffold SMILES would be O1C2=C(C=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C13. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the correct SMILES is O=c1coc2ccccc12, but without the =O. Wait, the =O is a substituent, so we remove it. So the first ring becomes c1ccoc2..., making the scaffold c1ccoc2ccccc12. Let me check that. The original SMILES has a five-membered ring with oxygen and a ketone. Removing the ketone leaves a five-membered ring with oxygen (like furan), fused to a benzene. So the scaffold would be O1C2=CC=CC=C2C3=C1C=CC=C3. But in SMILES notation, this might be written as O1c2ccccc2c3c1cccc3. Wait, but how are the rings connected? If they are fused, the SMILES would have shared atoms. Let me try writing it properly. The fused system would be something like c1c(Oc2ccc(cc2)c1). No, perhaps more accurately, the scaffold is a benzofuran system. Benzofuran's SMILES is o1c2ccccc2cc1. But in this case, the original molecule might have a substituent on the furan ring (the =O), which is removed. So the scaffold would be benzofuran: o1c2ccccc2cc1. However, in the original SMILES, the oxygen is part of the five-membered ring, which is fused to the benzene. So the Murcko scaffold is benzofuran's structure. Let me confirm. Benzofuran's SMILES is O1C=CC=C2C1=CC=CC=C2, which can be written as o1c2ccccc2cc1. So if the input molecule's core is benzofuran, then the scaffold SMILES would be O1C2=CC=CC=C2C=C1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is o1c2ccccc2ccc1. Let me think again. The original molecule has two fused rings: a five-membered ring with an oxygen and a benzene ring. After removing all substituents, the scaffold is those two fused rings. So the five-membered ring has three carbons, one oxygen, and another carbon, fused to the benzene. The correct SMILES for that would be O1C2C=CC=C2C=CC1. Wait, maybe I should use lowercase for aromatic rings. So aromatic SMILES would be o1c2ccccc2ccc1. Let me check with a SMILES validator. Alternatively, perhaps it's c1ccc2c(c1)oc3ccccc23. No, that's for a different fused system. Alternatively, the correct SMILES is c1ccoc2ccccc12. Let me see: c1 (ring closure 1) followed by c, c, o, c2 (ring closure 2), then ccc12. So the first ring is five-membered: positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (o), 5 (connected back to 1 via closure 1). The second ring is six-membered: positions 5 (from first ring), 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, connected back to position 2 via closure 2. Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe the correct scaffold is o1c2ccccc2ccc1. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is O1C2=C(C=CC=C2)C=C1. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, considering the input SMILES after removing substituents: the methyl, the ketone (=O), the amide group, and the Br are all removed. So the core is the fused rings. The original rings are c1cc(=O)oc2cc... which becomes c1ccoc2ccccc12. So the SMILES would be O1C=C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C=C1. But in aromatic notation, it's o1c2ccccc2cc1. Testing this: benzofuran's SMILES is indeed o1c2ccccc2cc1. Yes. So the Murcko scaffold here is benzofuran. Therefore, the output should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"o1c2ccccc2cc1\"}.",

The molecule has a central ring connected to other groups. The Murcko scaffold requires removing side chains and exocyclic groups, keeping only the ring systems and connecting bonds.\n\nLooking at the SMILES, the main part is a central ring. The groups attached are the -O=c1cc... part and the -c2cccc(O)c2, which is a benzene ring with an oxygen. Wait, the central ring might be a fused ring system. Let me break it down.\n\nThe SMILES starts with O=c1cc... which suggests a carbonyl group attached to ring 1. Then there's -c2cccc(O)c2, which is a substituted benzene ring. The main structure has 'oc2c1ccc1ccccc12' which indicates fused rings. The central part is probably a bicyclic system with two fused rings, maybe a benzene ring fused to another ring, possibly with oxygen.\n\nTo extract the Murcko scaffold, I need to remove any substituents that are not part of the ring systems. The substituent here is the -c2cccc(O)c2 group attached to the central ring. That's a benzene ring with an -O group, but since it's a side chain (connected via a single bond), it should be removed. The carbonyl group (O=) might be part of a ring? Let me check the connectivity.\n\nThe central part is o (oxygen) in a ring. Wait, the SMILES is O=c1cc(-c2...)oc2c1ccc1ccccc12. So the first ring (ring1) starts with O=C connected to position 1. Then there's a carbon chain with a substituent (-c2cccc(O)c2) at position 3 (cc(-c2...)), followed by oxygen (o) connected to c2, which is part of ring1. The 'oc2c1...' part suggests that oxygen is part of a ring. Then, ring2 is connected to ring1, forming a fused system. The 'ccc1ccccc12' part might form another fused ring.\n\nSo the main scaffold would be the fused rings without the substituent benzene ring (-c2cccc(O)c2). Also, the carbonyl group (O=) might be part of a ring. Wait, in the SMILES, O=c1cc... indicates that the carbonyl is part of ring1. But if ring1 is a 5-membered ring with the O= as a substituent, then that oxygen is part of a ring? Let me sketch it mentally.\n\nRing1: O=C1C=C(-c2...)O... So maybe the first ring is a 5-membered ring with the carbonyl oxygen as part of the ring? Wait, that's not possible because carbonyl is a double bond. Wait, the SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to connect atoms. Let me parse it again:\n\nO=c1cc(-c2cccc(O)c2)oc2c1ccc1ccccc12.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- O=c1: the oxygen is double-bonded to C1, which is part of a ring (ring1).\n- C1 is connected to C2 (cc), which has a substituent (-c2cccc(O)c2). Then comes an oxygen (o) connected to C3 (oc2c1...). The 'oc2c1' suggests that the oxygen is part of ring2, which is connected to ring1.\n\nThe part after 'oc2c1' is 'ccc1ccccc12', which forms another ring (ring3?), but maybe this is a fused system. Let me see: c2 is part of ring2. Then 'c1ccc1ccccc12' \u2013 perhaps a benzene ring fused to another ring.\n\nWait, maybe the entire structure is a tricyclic system. Let me count the atoms:\n\nRing1: C1 (O=), C2, C3 (with substituent), O (ring oxygen), and another carbon? Or maybe it's a 5-membered ring with O=C1-C2-C3(-substituent)-O-C5 connected back to C1? That would form a 5-membered ring. Then, ring2 is formed by the oxygen and adjacent carbons, perhaps fused to another ring.\n\nAlternatively, the SMILES could be representing a benzofuran or a similar structure. The substituent is the benzene ring attached via a single bond, which should be removed. The carbonyl group (O=) might be part of a ring, so if the oxygen is part of the ring, then the scaffold would retain that.\n\nSo the main scaffold would be the fused rings without the side chains. The substituent -c2cccc(O)c2 is a benzene ring attached to the main scaffold, so removing that. The carbonyl group is part of the main ring, so it stays. The resulting scaffold would be the fused rings connected by the bridge without the substituent benzene.\n\nWait, but the original SMILES has 'oc2c1ccc1ccccc12' which might form a naphthalene-like system fused to another ring. Let me try to write the scaffold SMILES. If we remove the -c2cccc(O)c2 substituent, the scaffold would be O=c1ccoc2c1ccc1ccccc12. Let me check if that's correct. The original SMILES has O=c1cc(-c2...)oc2..., so removing the substituent would leave O=c1ccoc2c1ccc1ccccc12. But wait, the oxygen in the ring (oc2...) is part of the scaffold. So the scaffold would be the rings connected by the oxygen. Let me verify if that's a valid structure. The resulting SMILES should be the fused rings without the substituent benzene. The rings in the scaffold would include the carbonyl group as part of a ring (if possible) but I think in this case, the O=C is part of a ring. So the final scaffold SMILES would be O=c1ccoc2c1ccc1ccccc12. Let me validate that. The main rings are a five-membered ring (with O=C and an oxygen bridge) fused to a naphthalene-like system. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzofuran derivative fused to another benzene ring. Yes, that seems plausible. So the Murcko scaffold should be the fused ring system without the substituent benzene attached. Therefore, the output SMILES is O=c1ccoc2c1ccc1ccccc12.",

The input SMILES is COc1ccc(C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2)cc1OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the rings and the connecting bonds. The main structure has a benzene ring (the 'c1ccc...cc1' part). There's also a thiazole ring (c2nccs2) connected via the carbonyl group (C(=O)NC). Then there's an oxygen-linked morpholine-like ring (OC1CCN...CC1), but with substituents on the nitrogen.\n\nFollowing the definition, I should remove all side chains and exocyclic groups. The methyl groups (OCH3) on the benzene are side chains, so those oxygens with methyl should go. The C(=O)NC(C) part is a substituent on the benzene, so remove that, leaving the benzene connected directly to the thiazole. The thiazole's sulfur is part of the ring, so it stays. The morpholine-like ring's side chains (the C(C) groups on the nitrogen) should be removed, leaving the six-membered ring with oxygen and nitrogen connected by ethylene chains. Wait, the OC1CCN...CC1 part: after removing the substituents on the nitrogen (C(C)C), the ring becomes O-C1C-C-N-CC1. So the connecting bonds between the benzene and the morpholine ring via the oxygen? Wait, the original SMILES has OC1... which is an oxygen connected to the benzene and then the ring. So the benzene is connected via an oxygen to the morpholine ring. But according to Murcko rules, connecting bonds are the ones between rings. So the oxygen is part of the connecting bond. But wait, the definition says to leave ring systems and connecting bonds. So if the oxygen is part of a chain connecting two rings, it's kept. Wait, but sometimes Murcko scaffolds consider the connecting atoms as the ones that are part of the rings. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the oxygen is part of a linker between the benzene and the morpholine ring. So the benzene is connected via an oxygen to the six-membered ring (which has O and N). So the Murcko scaffold would include the benzene ring, the thiazole ring (connected via a bond?), and the morpholine-like ring connected via the oxygen. But I need to check if the connecting bonds are those that link the rings. Let me break down the original structure:\n\nThe main benzene has substituents: OMe (which is a side chain, so removed), C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2 (the thiazole is a ring, connected via the carbonyl and amide group), and O-morpholine ring with substituents.\n\nSo, stripping all side chains and exocyclic groups: the benzene remains, the thiazole ring connected via a single bond (since the C(=O)NC part is a side chain), and the morpholine ring connected via the oxygen. Wait, but the carbonyl and amide groups are part of the substituent. So removing those, the benzene is connected directly to the thiazole ring? Or is there a connecting bond between them?\n\nWait, the original structure: benzene ring has a substituent at position where there's a C(=O)NC(C) group attached to the thiazole. So the benzene is connected via a carbonyl group to the amide nitrogen, which connects to the thiazole. That's a chain, not a direct bond. So those parts would be removed, leaving the benzene and thiazole as separate rings? But wait, maybe the thiazole is connected via a bond to the benzene. Let me look again.\n\nThe SMILES is COc1ccc(C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2)cc1OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1.\n\nBreaking down: the benzene (c1ccc(...)cc1) has substituents: OMe (COc1...), the C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2 group (attached at the C in the benzene ring), and O-C1CCN(...)CC1 (the morpholine ring).\n\nThe substituent C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2: the c2nccs2 is the thiazole ring (since the thiazole is a five-membered ring with N, C, C, S). The C(=O) is a carbonyl connected to an amide (NC(C)), which connects to the thiazole. So the thiazole is a substituent via that chain. Therefore, removing the side chains, the benzene would lose that substituent, leaving only the benzene ring. But wait, maybe the thiazole is part of a fused ring system? No, in this case, it's connected via a chain. So the Murcko scaffold would only include the benzene ring and the morpholine ring connected via the oxygen. Wait, but the morpholine ring has substituents on the nitrogen (C(C)C), which are exocyclic, so they should be removed. So the morpholine-like ring becomes O-C1C-C-N-CC1, a six-membered ring with O and N connected by ethylene chains.\n\nBut wait, the original morpholine part is OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1. Removing the substituent C(C)C on the N, we get OC1CCNCC1. So the ring is O-C-C-C-N-C-C, forming a six-membered ring with O and N. That's the morpholine ring. So the Murcko scaffold would have the benzene connected via an oxygen to the morpholine ring, and the benzene connected to the thiazole ring via a single bond? Wait, no, because the thiazole is connected via a chain (the amide and carbonyl groups), which are side chains. So the thiazole would be removed. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nMurcko scaffold is rings plus the connecting bonds. Any side chains (like substituents on rings) are removed. So, any substituent that's not part of a ring or a connecting bond between rings gets stripped. So the benzene has three substituents: two OMe groups (which are side chains) and the C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2 group. The OMe groups are removed. The C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2 is a chain leading to the thiazole ring. Since the thiazole is a ring, but connected via a non-ring bond (through the carbonyl and amide), the entire chain would be removed, leaving only the benzene ring. Wait, but maybe the connecting bond between the benzene and the thiazole is through a single bond that's part of the ring? No, the thiazole is a separate ring connected via a chain. So in that case, the thiazole would be considered a side chain and removed. Similarly, the morpholine ring is connected via an oxygen (as part of the linker). Wait, the benzene is connected to the oxygen, which is part of the morpholine ring. So the benzene and morpholine ring are connected via the oxygen. So the Murcko scaffold would include the benzene ring connected to the morpholine ring via the oxygen, and any other rings connected directly. The thiazole is connected via a chain, so it's removed. So the output scaffold should be the benzene connected to the morpholine ring via oxygen, forming a bridged structure? Let me draw this mentally.\n\nThe original SMILES: after removing the OMe groups, the substituents on the benzene are the C(=O)... and the O-morpholine. The C(=O)NC(C)c2nccs2 is a chain leading to the thiazole. Removing that, the benzene has the O-morpholine substituent. The morpholine ring itself, after removing the N-substituent (C(C)C), becomes a six-membered ring with O and N. So the Murcko scaffold is benzene connected via an oxygen to the morpholine ring. So the SMILES would be c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1. Wait, but the morpholine ring is O-C1-C-C-N-C-C-1, which would be O1CCNCC1. So the entire structure would be c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1. But wait, the original benzene has the O connected to the morpholine ring. So yes, the benzene ring (with all Hs, but in SMILES as c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1). Also, is there any other ring? The thiazole is gone because it's connected via a side chain. So the output scaffold SMILES would be c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1. Let me check again. The input has the benzene ring with three substituents: two OMe groups and the C(=O)NC... and the OC1... So after removing OMe and the C(=O)NC... substituent, the only substituent left is the OC1... which is the morpholine ring. So the Murcko scaffold is benzene connected to morpholine via oxygen. That seems right. So the SMILES is c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1. But wait, the original morpholine ring was OC1CCN(C(C)C)CC1. After removing the C(C)C substituent on N, it becomes OC1CCNCC1. So the ring is O-C1-C-C-N-C-C-1, which is written as O1CCNCC1. So the benzene connected to that would be c1ccc(O2CCNCC2)cc1? Wait, no. The SMILES for the morpholine ring would be O1C2CCNCC12? Wait, maybe I need to write the SMILES correctly. Let me think. The morpholine ring is a six-membered ring with oxygen and nitrogen. The correct SMILES is O1CCNCC1. So when connected to the benzene, the benzene's oxygen is part of the morpholine ring. Wait, the original substituent is OC1CCN... So the oxygen is connected to the benzene and to the C1 of the morpholine ring. So the morpholine ring is O-C1-C-C-N-C-C-1. So the SMILES for the morpholine part is O1CCNCC1. Therefore, the benzene connected to the oxygen of the morpholine would be c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1. That's the correct SMILES for the scaffold. Now, but what about the thiazole ring? Was there any direct connection between the benzene and the thiazole that's part of the scaffold? No, because the thiazole is attached via a chain (C(=O)NC(C)), which is a side chain. Therefore, the thiazole is removed. So the final scaffold is benzene connected via an oxygen to the morpholine ring. So the output should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"c1ccc(OC2CCNCC2)cc1\"}.",

The central part seems to be a piperazine ring, which is N1CCCC(N...)C1. \n\nThe Murcko scaffold requires removing all side chains and functional groups. So the carbonyl (O=C) attached to the first benzene ring should be removed, leaving just the benzene ring. The fluorine on the second benzene ring is a substituent, so that gets taken off too. The piperazine ring itself is a ring system, but the connecting bonds between the rings are part of the scaffold. \n\nWait, the piperazine is connected to both benzene rings via the nitrogen atoms. The first nitrogen (N1) is part of the piperazine and connects to the carbonyl group, which we're removing. The other nitrogen (Nc2...) connects the piperazine to the second benzene ring. Since the connecting bonds are part of the scaffold, the piperazine remains, as well as the two benzene rings. But the substituents like the carbonyl and fluorine are stripped.\n\nSo the scaffold should consist of the two benzene rings connected through the piperazine. The connecting bonds between the piperazine and each benzene ring are part of the scaffold, so the nitrogens in the piperazine that link to the benzene rings stay.

Wait, but in the original structure, one nitrogen is connected to the carbonyl (which we remove) and the other to the aniline (which has the fluorine). So removing the side chains would leave the benzene rings connected via the piperazine. So the scaffold SMILES would be c1ccccc1N1CCCCNc2ccccc2C1. Wait, need to check the ring numbering.

After removing the substituents, the benzene rings are attached directly to the piperazine nitrogens.

The first benzene is attached to one nitrogen (N1), and the second benzene is attached to the other nitrogen. So the correct SMILES should be c1ccccc1N1CCCCNc2ccccc21.

Wait, the central ring might be a thiazine or similar. But in the Murcko scaffold, only the rings and the connecting bonds are kept. So the central ring would be part of the scaffold. Let me check again: the core is the rings and the bridges between them. The sulfonyl and carbonyl groups are substituents, so they're removed. The connecting bonds between the rings and the central structure are kept. \n\nSo the final scaffold would have the two benzene rings connected through the central ring, but without the sulfonyl, carbonyl, and other side chains. The central ring is part of the scaffold. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold SMILES should be c1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)C2CCN(C2)c3ccccc3. Wait, but the sulfonyl is exocyclic. No, the sulfonyl is attached to the central ring. Wait, the original structure has S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1 attached to the central ring. So if we remove the sulfonyl groups, would the sulfur remain? Or is the sulfur part of the ring? Let me re-examine the original SMILES: CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(COC(=O)c2ccccc2)C1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1. The central ring is C1 connected to N and S. So the ring atoms are C-C-N-C-S-C? Wait, the SMILES is CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(COC(=O)c2ccccc2)C1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1. Breaking down the central ring: The first C is part of the ring (position 1), then connected to another CC branch. The N is part of the ring, connected to COC... Then the S is part of the ring, connected to the sulfonyl and a benzene. So the central ring is a six-membered ring with two carbons, a nitrogen, a sulfur, and two more carbons? Hmm, maybe a thiazine-like ring. But regardless, the key is that the rings (the two benzene rings) and the central ring are part of the scaffold. The side chains like ethyl, carbonyl, ester groups are removed. So the scaffold would be the central ring (without substituents) connecting the two benzene rings. Wait, but the sulfonyl is attached to the central ring's sulfur. Since the definition says to remove exocyclic modifications, the sulfonyl groups (S(=O)(=O)) would be removed, leaving just the sulfur in the ring. But sulfur in the ring without substituents would be just S. Similarly, the carbonyl group on the nitrogen would be removed, leaving the nitrogen in the ring. So the central ring would have S and N as part of the ring, without substituents. Then the benzene rings attached via single bonds? Wait, but the original structure has the benzene attached via the sulfonyl group. If we remove the sulfonyl, does that mean the benzene is no longer connected? Wait, no. The S is part of the central ring. The sulfonyl groups (O=SO=O) are substituents on the S, so removing them leaves the S in the ring. Then the benzene ring is attached to the S via a single bond. Wait, but in the original SMILES, the S is connected to the benzene via S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1. So the S is part of the central ring and has the sulfonyl group (which is exocyclic). Removing the sulfonyl group (the =O groups), the S would just be a single bond to the benzene? No, wait, the S is in the ring. The sulfonyl is a substituent. So after removal, the S is part of the ring and connected to the benzene ring via a single bond. Wait, but in the original structure, the S is part of the central ring and has a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) connected to the benzene. So the benzene is attached via the sulfonyl group. If we remove the sulfonyl group, the benzene would no longer be attached. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I need to re-express the structure. Let's parse the SMILES again: The central ring is built as follows: CCC1(CC)... So the first carbon (CCC1) is connected to the ring. Then CC (another ethyl group) is a branch on C1. Then C(=O) is attached to C1. Then N(COC(=O)c2ccccc2) is part of the ring. Then C1 (another carbon in the ring) connected to S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1. So the central ring is a six-membered ring: C1 (from CCC1), connected to another C (from CC), then to the carbonyl C(=O), then N, then COC..., then C1 again? Wait, perhaps the central ring is a five-membered ring? Let me count: The SMILES is CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(COC(=O)c2ccccc2)C1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1. The ring closure is C1 at the end (the S is connected to C1). So the ring is formed by the first C1 and the last C1. The atoms in the ring would be: C (from CCC1), then the next C (from CC branch), then C(=O), then N, then COC..., then C (from C1S...). Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to draw the structure. Alternatively, think of the ring as C-C-C(=O)-N-C-S, with the S connected back to the first C. But the SMILES notation can be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the central ring is a six-membered ring: positions 1 (C), 2 (C attached to CC), 3 (C=O), 4 (N), 5 (C attached to OCO...), 6 (S). Then the ring is C-C-C(=O)-N-C-S-C (but that would be seven atoms, which doesn't make sense). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the Murcko scaffold retains the ring systems and the connecting bonds. Any exocyclic double bonds or substituents are removed. So for the central ring, any substituents like the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) would be removed, leaving the sulfur in the ring. Similarly, the carbonyl group (C=O) on the carbon in the ring would be removed, leaving just the carbon. The ester groups and ethyl branches are all side chains, so they're removed. The benzene rings are kept. So the scaffold would be the central ring (without substituents) connecting the two benzene rings. Wait, but in the original structure, the benzene rings are connected via the sulfonyl group and the ester group. If we remove those substituents, how are the benzenes connected? Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let's think again: The original molecule has two benzene rings. One is attached via the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1), and the other via the ester group (COC(=O)c2ccccc2). Both of these are side chains, so they should be removed. Wait, but that would disconnect the benzene rings from the central structure. That can't be right because the Murcko scaffold should include the rings and connecting bonds. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene rings are part of the scaffold. Wait, the definition says to leave the ring systems and connecting bonds. So any rings present in the original molecule are part of the scaffold, and any connecting bonds between them. So the two benzene rings are separate rings, but connected via the central ring. So the central ring is a bridge between the two benzene rings. But if the connecting groups are part of the side chains, they would be removed. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's approach it step by step.\n\n1. Identify all rings in the molecule. The two benzene rings (c2ccccc2 and c1ccccc1) are obvious. The central part has a ring formed by the closure of C1. Let's parse the SMILES again: The central part is CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(COC(=O)c2ccccc2)C1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1. The ring is closed between the first CCC1 and the last C1S... So the ring atoms are the first C1, then the next C (from CC), then C(=O), then N, then COC..., then C1 again. Wait, that would form a 5-membered ring? Let's see: positions 1 (C from CCC1), 2 (C from CC branch), 3 (C=O), 4 (N), 5 (C from C1S...). That's five atoms: C-C-C(=O)-N-C, which forms a five-membered ring. Then the S is attached to that C (position 5), but the S is not part of the ring. Wait, no, because the ring closure is between the first C1 and the last C1. So the ring is C1-C-C(=O)-N-C-C1? Wait, that would make a six-membered ring: C1 (from CCC1), then the next C (branch CC), then C(=O), then N, then C (from the central part), then back to C1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ring is a five-membered ring. This is getting complicated without drawing it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central ring is a five-membered ring: C1 connected to C (from CC), then C(=O), then N, then C (from the C1S... part), forming a five-membered ring. Then the S is attached to that C. But regardless, the key is to retain the ring systems. So the central ring (whatever its size) is part of the scaffold. The substituents on the central ring (like the sulfonyl, carbonyl, ester groups, ethyl branches) are all side chains and should be removed. The two benzene rings are connected via the central ring. Wait, but in the original structure, the benzene rings are attached via the sulfonyl and ester groups, which are side chains. So removing those would disconnect the benzenes. That can't be right. Therefore, maybe the benzene rings are not part of the scaffold. Wait, but the definition says to leave the ring systems. So the benzene rings are ring systems and should be kept. But how are they connected? If the connection is through a side chain, then that bond is removed. For example, if a benzene is connected via a sulfonyl group (which is a side chain), then the benzene would not be part of the scaffold. Wait, but the sulfonyl is a functional group, so it's removed. Therefore, the benzene attached via the sulfonyl would no longer be connected. Similarly, the benzene attached via the ester group (COC(=O)) would also be disconnected. That would leave only the central ring as the scaffold. But that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central ring is part of the scaffold, and the two benzene rings are connected via the central ring's substituents. But since those substituents are removed, the benzenes are no longer connected. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would just be the central ring without substituents. But that can't be right either. \n\nWait, perhaps I should use a tool to generate the scaffold. But since I can't do that, I have to think through. Another approach: The Murcko scaffold is the framework of the molecule, retaining all rings and the bonds that connect them. Any atom that is not part of a ring or a connecting bond is removed. So, let's look for all atoms that are in rings or in the bridges between rings. \n\nThe two benzene rings are separate. The central ring (from the SMILES) is a ring that connects to the sulfonyl and ester groups. The sulfonyl group connects to a benzene, and the ester connects to another benzene. But those groups are not part of the rings, so they are removed. Therefore, the central ring remains, but without the sulfonyl and ester substituents. The two benzene rings are not part of the scaffold because they are connected via side chains. Wait, but the benzene rings themselves are rings, so they should be included. Wait, the definition says \"leaving only the ring systems and connecting bonds.\" So if a benzene ring is connected via a single bond (which is a connecting bond), then it's part of the scaffold. But in this case, the benzene rings are connected via functional groups (sulfonyl and ester), which are not rings. Therefore, the connecting bonds would be the bonds that are part of the central ring. So the scaffold would include the central ring and any other rings directly connected via bonds that are part of the ring systems. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let's think of an example. For instance, in aspirin (O=C(Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O)C), the Murcko scaffold is the benzene ring. The ester groups are removed. Similarly, in this case, the central ring would be part of the scaffold, and any rings directly attached via connecting bonds. But if the benzenes are attached via non-ring bonds (like through sulfonyl), then they are not part of the scaffold. So in the input molecule, the benzene rings are attached via sulfonyl and ester groups, which are not part of any ring. Therefore, removing those groups would disconnect the benzenes, leaving only the central ring as the scaffold. But wait, the central ring might have substituents that are part of other rings. For example, if the central ring is connected to another ring via a single bond (like biphenyl), then both rings are kept. But in this case, the connection is via functional groups. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the benzene rings are not part of the scaffold because they are connected via non-ring bonds. Therefore, the only ring in the scaffold is the central ring. But I'm not sure. Another angle: The Murcko scaffold is intended to represent the core structure that's common among similar drugs. So if the molecule has two benzene rings attached via a central ring with various substituents, the scaffold would be the central ring plus any rings directly fused or connected via bridges. \n\nIn the input molecule, the two benzene rings are connected via the central ring through the sulfonyl and ester groups. Since those groups are not part of the rings, they are removed. Therefore, the benzene rings would not be part of the scaffold. The scaffold is just the central ring. But what's the structure of the central ring? Let's try to reconstruct it without substituents. The central ring, after removing all side chains and exocyclic groups, would have the following atoms: the ring itself, which includes the nitrogen and sulfur. Wait, the sulfur is part of the central ring? In the original SMILES, the sulfur is attached to the central ring's carbon (C1S(=O)(=O)...). So if the sulfur is not part of the ring, then removing the sulfonyl group would leave just the carbon attached to nothing. But that can't be right. Alternatively, if the sulfur is part of the central ring, then removing the sulfonyl groups would leave the sulfur in the ring. \n\nThis is really tricky without visualizing. Let me try to write the scaffold SMILES. Original SMILES: CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(COC(=O)c2ccccc2)C1S(=O)(=O)c1ccccc1. Removing all substituents: the ethyl groups (CCC1(CC)), the carbonyl (C(=O)), the ester (COC(=O)c2...), the sulfonyl (S(=O)(=O)c1...). What's left is the ring atoms. So the central ring would be C1-C-C-N-C-C1 (a five-membered ring?), with the sulfur attached to one of the carbons? Or is the sulfur part of the ring? If the sulfur is part of the ring, then the ring would be something like C1-C-C-N-S-C1, making a five-membered ring. But in the original SMILES, the sulfur is connected to C1 via a single bond (C1S...), suggesting it's not part of the ring. Therefore, the central ring is a five-membered ring (C-C-C-N-C), and the sulfur is a substituent. But then removing the sulfur's substituents (the sulfonyl group) would leave the sulfur attached to the ring carbon. But sulfur as a substituent is not part of the ring, so it would be removed as a side chain. Wait, but sulfur is a heteroatom; if it's part of the ring, it stays. If it's a substituent, it's removed. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct scaffold is the central ring without substituents. Let's assume the central ring is a five-membered ring: C1-C-C-N-C-C1 (but that's six members). Wait, maybe the ring is six-membered. Let's count again. The SMILES has CCC1(CC)C(=O)N(...)C1S(...). The closure is between the first C1 and the last C1. So the ring includes the atoms between the two C1s. Let's list them: C1 (from CCC1), then C (from CC branch), then C(=O), then N, then COC..., then C (from C1S...). Wait, that's six atoms forming the ring: C1 (1), C (2), C(=O) (3), N (4), C (5), S (6?), and back to C1. Wait, no, the last part is C1S..., which is the same C1 as the start. So the ring is C1 connected to C (from CC), then to C(=O), then to N, then to C (from C1S...), then to S, and back to C1? That would make a six-membered ring: C1-C-C(=O)-N-C-S-C1. But sulfur typically has two bonds, so that would make a six-membered ring with sulfur having two single bonds (to C and C1). But SMILES allows for such notation. However, in reality, sulfur in a ring usually has two single bonds, but can have expanded valence with double bonds. However, in this case, the sulfur has a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which would be exocyclic. \n\nAfter removing all exocyclic groups, the sulfur in the ring would remain with its single bonds. So the central ring is C1-C-C-N-C-S-C1 (six-membered), but that's actually seven atoms. Wait, no, C1 is the same as the last C1. So the ring is C1 (1) connected to C (2), then to C(=O) (3), then to N (4), then to C (5), then to S (6), and back to C1 (1). That's a six-membered ring: 1-2-3-4-5-6-1. But atoms 3 (C(=O)) and 6 (S) would have exocyclic groups. Removing those, the ring becomes C-C-C-N-C-S, but without the substituents. But the scaffold requires retaining the ring systems and connecting bonds. So the central ring remains as is, but without the substituents. The two benzene rings are attached via the sulfonyl and ester groups, which are now removed. Therefore, the benzene rings are no longer connected to the central ring. Hence, the Murcko scaffold is just the central ring. But wait, the benzene rings themselves are ring systems. If they are connected via the central ring's substituents, which are removed, then they are not part of the scaffold. Therefore, the scaffold is the central ring only. \n\nBut how to represent that in SMILES? The central ring after removal of substituents would be a six-membered ring: C1CCNCS1. But wait, the original substituents were ethyl groups, carbonyl, etc. So stripping those, the ring would be C1-C-C-N-C-S-C1. But SMILES for that would be C1CCNCS1. However, sulfur in a six-membered ring with single bonds might have different valence. Alternatively, maybe the ring is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central ring is a five-membered ring. Let me try to count again. The closure is between the first C1 and the last C1. The atoms in between are: C (from CC branch), C(=O), N, C (from C1S...). So that's four atoms between the two C1s, making a five-membered ring: C1-C-C(=O)-N-C-C1. But that's six atoms. Wait, no: C1 (1), C (2), C(=O) (3), N (4), C (5), back to C1 (1). That's a five-membered ring? No, that's five atoms: 1-2-3-4-5-1. Wait, that's six bonds. No, a five-membered ring has five atoms. So perhaps I'm miscounting. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the best possible answer. The Murcko scaffold would retain the central ring and any directly attached rings. But given the input structure, the benzene rings are attached via side chains, so they're removed. The central ring, after removing substituents, is the scaffold. \n\nSo the SMILES would be something like C1CCN(C1)S(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2, but wait, the sulfonyl is removed. So without substituents, it's C1CCNC1. But that's a five-membered ring? Wait, no. Alternatively, if the central ring is a six-membered ring with S, then maybe S is part of the ring. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the correct scaffold is the two benzene rings connected via a central structure. But given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is c1ccccc1.c2ccccc2 for the two benzene rings, but they're not connected. But that's unlikely. Another approach: Use the RDKit Murcko method. The algorithm would detect all rings and the bridge atoms. For this molecule, the two benzene rings are separate, and the central part is a bridged system. The Murcko scaffold would include all rings and the bridging atoms. So perhaps the scaffold is the central ring plus the two benzene rings connected via bridges. But without the substituents. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll conclude that the Murcko scaffold is the central ring plus the two benzene rings connected via the central ring's atoms. But removing the sulfonyl and ester groups. The final SMILES would be c1ccc(cc1)SCCNCC2CCS(=O)(=O)c3ccccc3. No, that's not right. \n\nWait, another way: The original molecule has a central ring connected to two benzene rings via sulfonyl and ester groups. Removing those groups, the benzene rings are disconnected. So the scaffold is just the central ring. The SMILES for the central ring without substituents would be C1CCN(C1)S. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is the central ring without substituents, which is a six-membered ring with N and S. So the SMILES would be C1CCSNC1. But I'm not certain. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll go with the answer that the scaffold is the central ring plus the two benzene rings connected via the central ring's atoms, but without the substituents. However, I'm not entirely sure. But according to the definition, the scaffold should include ring systems and connecting bonds. The connecting bonds are those that are part of the ring or bridges. In this case, the benzene rings are connected via non-ring bonds (sulfonyl and ester), so they're removed. Therefore, the scaffold is the central ring. \n\nSo the final answer is the central ring's SMILES: C1CCN(C1)S. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold includes the two benzene rings connected through the central ring's atoms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct scaffold is c1ccccc1SCCNCC2ccccc2. But without the sulfonyl. But I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to the answer as follows: The Murcko scaffold is the central ring system without substituents, which would be represented as C1CCN(C1)S. However, this might not be correct. Alternatively, it's the two benzene rings connected via the central ring, leading to a more complex scaffold. But I'm uncertain. \n\nAfter reconsidering, the correct approach is to remove all substituents and leave the rings. The two benzene rings are not part of the same ring system, so they are excluded. The central ring is the only ring system left. Therefore, the scaffold is the central ring, which after removing substituents, would be C1CCN(C1)S. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, the scaffold is the central ring plus the two benzene rings, but connected via the central ring. \n\nWait, the original molecule has two benzene rings attached via the sulfonyl and ester groups. Removing those groups would disconnect them. Therefore, the scaffold is the central ring. \n\nFinal answer: {\"Output Scaffold\": \"C1CCN(C1)S\"}",

The input is O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the rings and connecting bonds. The Murcko scaffold removes side chains and keeps rings and the linkers between them. Let me parse the structure.\n\nLooking at the SMILES: there's a central carbonyl group (O=C) attached to an NC(=S)NC chain. Then there's a c1ccco1 ring, which is a five-membered ring (like oxolane but with double bonds maybe). The other part is c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1, which is a benzene ring with a nitro group. Wait, but the nitro is an exocyclic group, so that should be removed. The connecting part between the rings would be the bonds that link them. Let me break it down.\n\nThe main structure after removing side chains: the benzene ring (c1ccc...cc1) connected via the carbonyl group to the other ring. Wait, the original structure has O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1) attached to the benzene. The NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 part is a side chain? So the Murcko scaffold would be the two rings connected by the central carbonyl group. The five-membered ring (c1ccco1) is a separate ring. The benzene ring is another. The connecting part is the carbonyl (C=O) that links them. But wait, the actual connecting bonds between the rings might be through the amide groups. Let me visualize.\n\nOriginal molecule: The central carbonyl (O=C) is connected to an amine group (NH) which has a thiocarbonyl (C=S) group, then another amine (N) connected to a CH2 group (C) leading to the five-membered ring (c1ccco1). The other side of the carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring with a nitro group. But according to Murcko's rules, we remove all functional groups and side chains. So the nitro group on the benzene is a functional group and should be removed. Similarly, the thiocarbonyl and the amine chains should be removed. So the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via the carbonyl group to the five-membered ring (oxolane or similar). Wait, but the connecting bonds between the rings need to be just the linkers. Wait, the original structure is O=C(...) attached to the benzene. The part after the carbonyl is a side chain leading to the five-membered ring. So maybe the scaffold is the benzene ring connected via the carbonyl to the five-membered ring. But how exactly are they connected?\n\nWait, the central part is O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1. The main chain is the carbonyl connected to two substituents: one is NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 and the other is the benzene ring with nitro. So the Murcko scaffold would retain the rings and the connecting bonds. The connecting bond here would be the carbonyl group (C=O) between the two rings. But wait, the NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 is a side chain attached to the carbonyl. So removing that, the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via the carbonyl to the five-membered ring. But wait, the five-membered ring is part of the side chain. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central scaffold is the benzene ring connected via a single bond (from the carbonyl) to another ring. Wait, the SMILES is O=C(...)c1ccc(...)cc1. The carbonyl is attached directly to the benzene. Then the other side of the carbonyl is attached to the NC(=S)N... chain leading to the five-membered ring. So the actual rings are the benzene and the five-membered ring (c1ccco1). The connecting part is the carbonyl group and the adjacent atoms? Or do we need to remove the carbonyl as a functional group?\n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold definition says to leave ring systems and the connecting bonds between them. Functional groups and side chains are removed. So any atom that is part of a ring or a connecting chain between rings is kept. So, if there's a chain connecting two rings, that chain is part of the scaffold. For example, if two rings are connected by a methylene group (-CH2-), that's part of the scaffold. But functional groups like nitro, carbonyl, etc., attached to rings would be removed.\n\nBut in this case, the central part is a carbonyl group (O=C) connected to the benzene on one side and a side chain leading to the five-membered ring on the other. The side chain includes NC(=S)N-C-... So the connecting chain between the two rings (benzene and five-membered) would be the C=O connected to a nitrogen, but that's part of a functional group. Wait, perhaps I need to strip all substituents from the rings except for the connecting bonds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the scaffold is the benzene ring and the five-membered ring connected via the carbonyl and the adjacent nitrogen? Or is the carbonyl considered a functional group and thus removed?\n\nWait, let's look up an example. For example, in the classic Murcko scaffold, if you have a structure like benzene connected via an amide link (-NH-CO-) to another ring, the scaffold would include the two rings connected by the amide linker's carbon and nitrogen? Or would the amide group be removed as a functional group?\n\nWait, according to the definition, the Murcko scaffold retains ring systems and the connecting bonds. So any atoms that are part of the linker between rings are kept. So if there's a chain of atoms connecting two rings, those atoms are part of the scaffold. But functional groups attached to rings (like nitro, carbonyl, etc.) are removed.\n\nSo in the input molecule, the benzene ring has a nitro group, which is a functional group, so it's removed. The five-membered ring (c1ccco1) is a ring, so it's kept. The connecting part between the two rings is the path through the carbonyl group. Let's trace the path from the benzene to the five-membered ring.\n\nThe benzene is attached to a carbonyl (C=O), which is connected to an NH group, then a C=S, then another NH, then a CH2, then the five-membered ring. So the path from benzene to the five-membered ring is via the carbonyl, then several atoms (N, C=S, N, CH2). But these are all part of the side chain, not a connecting chain between rings. Therefore, the actual scaffold would only include the benzene ring and the five-membered ring if they are connected directly or via a linker that's part of the scaffold. But in this case, the linker is part of a functional group side chain, so maybe the two rings are not connected in the scaffold, but that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me parse the SMILES again. The SMILES is O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2. The central atom is the carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is connected to two groups: one is the benzene ring (c2ccc...cc2) and the other is NC(=S)NCc1ccco1. The NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 part is a chain leading to the five-membered ring. So the path from the carbonyl to the five-membered ring is N-C(=S)-N-C-CH2- (since NCc1ccco1 is N-C-C...). Wait, NCc1ccco1 is N connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to the five-membered ring (c1ccco1). So the chain is N-C(=S)-N-CH2- connecting the carbonyl to the five-membered ring.\n\nTherefore, the two rings (benzene and five-membered) are connected via a chain of atoms: carbonyl C connected to N, then C=S, then N, then CH2, then the ring. According to Murcko's rules, the scaffold should retain the rings and the connecting chain between them. But wait, the connecting chain is the shortest path between the rings. However, in this case, the chain includes functional groups like thiourea (NC(=S)N), which are considered side chains. So perhaps those are stripped, leaving only the rings and any direct connecting bonds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the connecting chain is the minimal path. Wait, the Murcko scaffold is formed by removing all side chains and functional groups, but keeping the ring systems and the linkers between them. So the linker is any chain that connects two rings. So even if the linker has multiple atoms, like a -CH2-CH2- between rings, that's part of the scaffold. But functional groups attached to the linker would be removed.\n\nIn this case, the path from the benzene to the five-membered ring is via the carbonyl C, then N, then C(=S), then N, then CH2. But this seems like a side chain rather than a direct linker. Wait, perhaps the actual scaffold is only the benzene ring, since the five-membered ring is connected via a side chain. Or perhaps I need to identify all rings and the connecting atoms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central carbonyl is part of a ring? No, the carbonyl is a ketone. So perhaps the Murcko scaffold is the two rings (benzene and five-membered) connected via the carbonyl group. But the carbonyl is a functional group, which would be removed. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me think of an example. If you have a molecule like benzene-CH2-CO-NH-cyclopropane, the Murcko scaffold would be benzene connected via CH2-CO-NH to cyclopropane? Or would the CO and NH be considered functional groups and removed, leaving just benzene-CH2-cyclopropane? No, according to the definition, the connecting bonds are kept. So the entire chain between the rings is part of the scaffold. But functional groups attached to the rings (not part of the connecting chain) are removed.\n\nWait, perhaps in the given molecule, the connecting chain between the benzene and the five-membered ring is the path through the carbonyl, N, C(=S), N, CH2. But that's a long chain, and perhaps only certain parts are considered linkers. Alternatively, maybe the scaffold is just the benzene ring and the five-membered ring with the connecting atoms. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the nitro group on the benzene is removed, and the thiourea group (NC(=S)N) is removed, leaving the benzene connected via the carbonyl and the CH2 to the five-membered ring. But then the connecting chain would be -C(=O)-NH-CH2-, but the NH is part of the functional group. Wait, maybe the connecting chain is only the carbonyl and the CH2? That doesn't make sense because the NH is in between.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the scaffold is just the two rings (benzene and five-membered) connected via a single bond. But in the original structure, they are connected via a longer chain. So perhaps there is no connecting chain in the scaffold, meaning the scaffold consists of the two separate rings. That can't be right because the definition says to keep the connecting bonds.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try drawing the structure. The central carbonyl is attached to the benzene and to the side chain. The side chain is NC(=S)NCc1ccco1. Breaking that down: the N is connected to the carbonyl, then to C(=S), then another N, then a CH2 group connected to the five-membered ring. So the five-membered ring is attached via a CH2 to the N, which is part of a thiourea group (NC(=S)N). So the path from the carbonyl to the five-membered ring is N-C(=S)-N-CH2-.\n\nAccording to Murcko's rules, the scaffold should include rings and the connecting linkers. The linker here would be the path connecting the two rings. However, the NC(=S)N part is a functional group (thiourea) and thus considered a side chain. Therefore, those groups would be removed, leaving only the rings and any direct connecting atoms.\n\nWait, but the CH2 is part of the side chain leading to the five-membered ring. So removing the NC(=S)N group would leave the CH2 connected to the carbonyl. But the CH2 isn't part of a ring. So perhaps the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via the carbonyl to a CH2 group, which is connected to the five-membered ring. But that CH2 is a single atom chain. So the scaffold would be benzene-C(=O)-CH2-five-membered ring. But in the original structure, the CH2 is part of the NCc1ccco1 group. So after removing the N and C(=S)N parts, we have the CH2 connected directly to the carbonyl? Is that possible?\n\nWait, no. Because the original structure is O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c2ccc... So the carbonyl is connected to two groups: the benzene and the NC(=S)NCc1ccco1. If we remove the functional groups (the NC(=S)N part), then the remaining would be the carbonyl connected to the benzene and to the CH2 group leading to the five-membered ring. So the scaffold would be benzene-C(=O)-CH2-five-membered ring. But that would make the linker as -C(=O)-CH2-. However, carbonyl is a functional group. So should the carbonyl be removed?\n\nWait, the definition says to remove exocyclic modifications. The carbonyl here is exocyclic to the benzene ring. So the benzene's substituent is the carbonyl group, which is a functional group. So the benzene would lose that substituent. Similarly, the five-membered ring's substituent is the CH2 group, which is part of the side chain. So removing that, the scaffold would be the two separate rings? But that doesn't make sense because the original molecule has two rings connected via a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the connecting chain between the rings is considered part of the scaffold. For example, if two rings are connected by a single bond, that's part of the scaffold. If they're connected by a chain of atoms, those atoms are part of the scaffold. But in this case, the chain includes functional groups (like carbonyl, thiourea) which are not part of the linker.\n\nI'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for an automated way to do this, but since I'm doing it manually, let's try again.\n\nMurcko scaffold steps: Remove all substituents from rings, keep rings and the linkers between them. Linkers are the atoms that form the shortest path between two rings.\n\nIn this molecule, the benzene ring (c2ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc2) has a nitro group (exocyclic, so removed). The five-membered ring (c1ccco1) has no substituents except the CH2 group (from NCc1ccco1). The path between the two rings is through the carbonyl group and the chain NC(=S)NC. Wait, no. The path is benzene-C(=O)-N-C(=S)-N-CH2-five-membered. That's a long path. The linker would be the shortest path between the two rings. But in this case, the shortest path is benzene-C(=O)-N-C(=S)-N-CH2-five-membered. But this includes functional groups. So perhaps the actual linker is the part that connects the two rings without side chains. However, in this structure, the entire path is part of the side chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the benzene and the five-membered ring are not connected in the scaffold. That can't be right. Wait, the original molecule has the two rings connected via the central carbonyl and the side chain. If we remove all side chains, maybe the two rings are no longer connected. But that would mean the scaffold is just the two separate rings, which is unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the actual rings are the benzene and the five-membered ring, and the connecting linker is the carbonyl and the CH2 group. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the central part is considered a ring? No, the central part is a carbonyl.\n\nAnother approach: Generate the scaffold by removing all terminal atoms that are not part of rings or linkers. So starting from the rings, any branches off the main chain connecting the rings are removed.\n\nThe benzene is connected to the carbonyl. The carbonyl is connected to the NC(=S)N... chain leading to the five-membered ring. The main chain between the two rings is the path through the carbonyl, N, C(=S), N, CH2. But each of these atoms (except maybe the CH2) could be part of functional groups. So removing the functional groups would leave the CH2 as part of the linker. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Murcko scaffold here is the benzene ring and the five-membered ring connected via a single bond. But that's not the case in the original structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct scaffold is the benzene ring and the five-membered ring connected via the carbonyl group and the adjacent nitrogen. But that would make the scaffold benzene-C(=O)-N-... but that's part of the functional group.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct approach is to remove all substituents from the rings, including any chains that are not part of the linker. In this case, the nitro group on the benzene is a substituent, so removed. The chain attached to the benzene's carbonyl is a side chain leading to the five-membered ring. So removing that side chain (NC(=S)NCc1ccco1), the scaffold would just be the benzene ring. But that can't be right because the five-membered ring is also a ring in the molecule.\n\nWait, the five-membered ring is part of a side chain attached to the main scaffold. So the main scaffold is the benzene ring with the carbonyl group. The five-membered ring is part of a substituent on the carbonyl, so it's removed. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold would be the benzene ring only. But that seems incorrect because the five-membered ring is a ring system.\n\nWait, perhaps both rings are part of the scaffold. But how are they connected? The path between them is through the carbonyl and the side chain. If the side chain is removed, the rings are not connected. So the scaffold would be the two separate rings. But Murcko scaffolds typically merge rings connected by linkers.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of another example. Take aspirin: O=C(Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O)C. The scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via the ester oxygen to the acetyl group. But according to Murcko, the scaffold would be the benzene ring and the acetyl's carbonyl, but I think the ester group is removed, leaving just the benzene. Wait, no. The Murcko scaffold of aspirin is the benzene ring with the oxygen linker. Wait, no. The actual scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via the oxygen to the carbonyl group. But that's a functional group. So maybe the scaffold is just the benzene ring. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another example: diphenhydramine, which has two benzene rings connected via an oxygen and a CH2 group. The scaffold would be the two benzene rings connected by O-CH2.\n\nIn the current problem, if the two rings are connected via a chain that includes functional groups, but those groups are part of the linker, they should be kept. But if they are side chains, they should be removed.\n\nIn the input molecule, the benzene is connected to a carbonyl, which is connected to a chain leading to the five-membered ring. The chain includes NC(=S)N. Since these are amide and thiourea groups, they are functional groups and should be removed. So removing them, the remaining linker would be just the CH2 connecting the carbonyl to the five-membered ring. But how?\n\nWait, the original chain is NC(=S)NCc1ccco1. Removing the functional groups (NC(=S)N), we're left with Cc1ccco1, which is CH2 connected to the five-membered ring. So the linker would be the carbonyl connected to CH2. So the scaffold would be benzene-C(=O)-CH2-five-membered ring. But carbonyl is a functional group. So should that be removed?\n\nNo, because the carbonyl is part of the linker connecting the two rings. Wait, according to the definition, the Murcko scaffold includes the rings and the connecting bonds. The connecting bonds are the atoms that form the path between the rings. So in this case, the path is benzene-C(=O)-N-C(=S)-N-CH2-five-membered. But that's a long chain with functional groups. However, the definition says to remove all side chains and functional groups, leaving only the rings and connecting bonds. So perhaps the connecting bonds are the minimal atoms needed to connect the rings. But I'm not sure how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to iteratively remove all terminal atoms that are not part of rings. So start with the entire structure and keep removing terminal atoms that are not in rings until only rings and connecting atoms remain.\n\nStarting with the benzene ring (c2ccc...cc2), which has a nitro group (terminal, so removed). Then the carbonyl is attached to the benzene. The carbonyl's other attachment is to the NC(=S)NCc1ccco1 chain. The five-membered ring (c1ccco1) is a terminal ring. The path from the benzene to the five-membered ring is through the carbonyl, N, C(=S), N, CH2. So starting from the five-membered ring, the CH2 is a single bond to N, which is connected to C(=S), then N, then carbonyl, then benzene. All these atoms are part of the chain. But are any of them part of a ring? Only the benzene and five-membered rings.\n\nSo, the process would be to remove all atoms that are not in rings and not part of the connecting chains between rings. So the connecting chain is the path between the two rings. However, the C(=S), N, and carbonyl are part of that path. But since they are not rings, perhaps they are part of the connecting chain. But according to the definition, the connecting bonds are kept. So the entire path between the rings is part of the scaffold.\n\nBut that would mean the scaffold includes the carbonyl, N, C(=S), N, CH2 as part of the linker. But those are functional groups, which should be removed. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the connecting bonds are only the atoms that form the shortest path between the rings, excluding functional groups. But how to determine that?\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find the correct answer.\n\nThe input SMILES is O=C(NC(=S)NCc1ccco1)c1ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc1.\n\nThe nitro group on the benzene is a substituent, so removed. The thiourea group (NC(=S)N) is a substituent on the carbonyl, so removed. The CH2 connecting to the five-membered ring is part of the linker. So the scaffold would be the benzene connected via the carbonyl and CH2 to the five-membered ring. Therefore, the scaffold SMILES would be O=C(Cc1ccco1)c1ccccc1. Wait, but the nitro is removed, so the benzene is c1ccccc1. The five-membered ring is c1ccco1. The connecting part is the carbonyl and the CH2. So the SMILES would be O=C(Cc1ccco1)c1ccccc1. But wait, is the CH2 part of the linker? In the original structure, the CH2 is part of the chain NC(=S)NCc1ccco1. Removing the NC(=S)N part, we're left with Cc1ccco1 attached to the carbonyl. So the linker is -CO-CH2-. Therefore, the scaffold would be the benzene ring connected via CO-CH2 to the five-membered ring. So the SMILES is O=C(Cc1ccco1)c1ccccc1.\n\nBut wait, does the carbonyl count as a functional group? According to the definition, functional groups are removed. The carbonyl is part of the linker between the rings, so it's kept. So the scaffold includes the carbonyl and the CH2 as part of the linker.\n\nTherefore, the output scaffold should be O=C(Cc1ccco1)c1ccccc1. Let me check if that's correct. The benzene ring (c1ccccc1) is connected to a carbonyl (O=C), which is connected to a CH2 group (C), which is connected to the five-membered ring (c1ccco1). That seems to fit the definition of keeping the rings and the connecting bonds (including the linker atoms).",

        "raw_cot": "Okay, so I need to find the Murcko scaffold for the SMILES string CC(C)C(=O)NC1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)CC1. Let me start by breaking down the structure.\n\nFirst, the molecule has a central ring. Let me parse the SMILES. The part after the NC is 1CCN(...)CC1, which is a cyclohexane ring with a nitrogen in it. The N has a substituent: Cc2ccccc2. That's a benzyl group attached to the nitrogen. Then there's the beginning part: CC(C)C(=O)NC... which is a tert-butyl carbonyl group attached to the amine.\n\nThe Murcko scaffold requires keeping the ring systems and the connecting bonds. So rings are the cyclohexane (ring1) and the benzene (ring2). The connecting bond between them is the one from the cyclohexane's nitrogen to the benzyl's methyl, but wait, the benzyl is a side chain. Wait, the benzene ring is attached via a methylene (-CH2-) to the nitrogen in the cyclohexane. So the benzene is a side chain here. Therefore, the Murcko scaffold should only include the cyclohexane ring and remove the benzene. Wait, no, because the benzene is a ring system, but is it part of the main framework?\n\nWait, Murcko scaffold is rings and the connecting bonds between them. If there are two rings connected via a chain, but that chain is part of the scaffold. Wait, no: the connecting bonds are the ones that link the rings directly. For example, if two rings are fused or connected by a single bond without side chains. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal structure: The main ring is the cyclohexane (1CCN...CC1). The nitrogen in that ring is connected to a CH2 group (from Cc2ccccc2). The CH2 is connected to a benzene ring (c2ccccc2). So the benzene is attached via a single bond (the methylene). According to Murcko's rules, side chains and exocyclic groups are removed. The benzene here is a substituent on the cyclohexane's nitrogen. So it's a side chain, so we remove it. Wait, but the benzene is a ring. So would that be considered part of the scaffold? Hmm.\n\nWait, the Murcko scaffold is supposed to retain all ring systems and the linkers between them. So if there are two rings connected by a linker (like a single bond or a chain), they are part of the scaffold. But in this case, the benzene is connected via a methylene (-CH2-) group to the cyclohexane's nitrogen. The methylene is a single atom chain. Wait, but the definition says to remove exocyclic modifications. Exocyclic groups are those attached to a ring atom but not part of the ring. So the benzene is attached via a single bond (exocyclic) to the cyclohexane's nitrogen. Therefore, the benzene is a substituent and should be removed. The linker here is the nitrogen in the cyclohexane ring. So the main scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring. Wait, but the connecting bonds between rings. If there's another ring connected via a linker, like a chain of atoms, then it's part of the scaffold. But in this case, the benzene is connected via a single methylene group. So the linker is the -CH2- between the two rings. But is that considered part of the scaffold? I think the Murcko scaffold includes all rings connected by linkers (at least one atom), but without any substituents. So the benzene ring is connected via a methylene to the cyclohexane. Therefore, the linker is the methylene and the two rings (cyclohexane and benzene) would be part of the scaffold, connected by the methylene. Wait, but the original molecule has the benzyl group as a substituent on the cyclohexane's nitrogen. So when we remove substituents, do we remove the entire benzyl group (the benzene and the methylene), or just the benzene? Hmm, maybe the methylene is part of the linker. Let me check an example. For example, in a structure like C1CCN(CC2CCCCC2)CC1, the scaffold would include both rings connected by the nitrogen and the ethylene. Wait, no. Wait, Murcko scaffold includes rings and the linkers between them. So if two rings are connected by a chain (like a single bond or a chain of atoms), that chain is part of the scaffold. But in this case, the benzene is connected via a methylene (one carbon) to the cyclohexane's nitrogen. So the linker is the methylene. Therefore, the scaffold would be the cyclohexane connected via the methylene to the benzene. But wait, the connecting bonds are the ones that are part of the framework. So the scaffold should include both rings and the connecting methylene. However, the original molecule's substituent on the nitrogen is the entire benzyl group (CH2C6H5). So the Murcko scaffold would retain the rings and the connecting bonds. Therefore, the correct scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring connected via a methylene to the benzene ring. Wait, but the methylene is part of the substituent. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. The Murcko scaffold is obtained by removing all side chains and exocyclic groups. The exocyclic groups would be substituents attached to the rings. So the nitrogen in the cyclohexane has a substituent: CH2-benzene. The entire substituent (CH2-benzene) is a side chain. So the scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring with the nitrogen, but without the substituent. Wait, but then the nitrogen would have only the ring bonds. But the original cyclohexane has a substituent (the benzyl), which is a side chain. So removing that would leave the cyclohexane ring. However, the nitrogen in the ring has another substituent from the carbonyl group. Let's look again at the SMILES: CC(C)C(=O)NC1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)CC1. The main chain is the NC(=O)C(C)C part attached to the cyclohexane. So the cyclohexane (ring) is connected to the amide group. The amide group is a substituent, so it would be removed. The other substituent is the benzyl group on the nitrogen. So after removing all substituents (the amide group and the benzyl group), the scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring. Wait, but cyclohexane with a nitrogen in the ring. The original cyclohexane ring is part of the structure. But the nitrogen is part of the ring. So the scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring with the nitrogen. So the rings are part of the scaffold, and any connecting bonds between rings. But in this case, there's only one ring (cyclohexane) unless the benzyl's benzene is considered connected via a linker. But the benzyl is a substituent, so it's removed. So the final scaffold is the cyclohexane ring with the nitrogen, but without any substituents. Wait, but the connecting bonds between rings. If the benzene is connected via a methylene, which is a linker, then the scaffold would include both rings connected by the methylene. But I'm confused. Let me check an example. For example, if you have a structure like C1CCN(CC2CCCC2)CC1, the Murcko scaffold would be the two rings (cyclohexane and cyclopentane) connected via the ethylene linker. But in our case, the substituent on the nitrogen is a benzyl group (CH2C6H5), which is a side chain. So according to the definition, we remove all side chains. Therefore, the scaffold would be the cyclohexane ring (with the nitrogen) and any connecting linkers. But in this case, the benzyl group is a side chain, so it's removed. The amide group (C(=O)NC(C)(C)C) is also a substituent on the nitrogen, so that's removed too. So the scaffold is just the cyclohexane ring with the nitrogen in the ring. The SMILES for that would be C1CCNCC1. Wait, the original cyclohexane ring is 1CCN(...)CC1. So the core is N in a six-membered ring. So the SMILES for the cyclohexane with the nitrogen would be C1CCNCC1. Let me confirm. The original part is NC1CCN(...)CC1. So the nitrogen is part of the ring. The ring is cyclohexane with two carbons between the two nitrogens. Wait, the original SMILES is NC1CCN(...)CC1. So the ring is NC1-C-C-N(...)-C-C-1. So the ring is N-C-C-N-C-C, making a six-membered ring. Wait, the actual structure is the ring: positions 1 is connected to N, then two carbons, then another N, then two carbons. So the ring is [N]-C-C-N-C-C. So the SMILES for that ring would be C1CNCCN1? Wait, maybe not. Let me parse the original SMILES again. The input is CC(C)C(=O)NC1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)CC1. The part after the NC is the ring: C1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)CC1. So the ring is 1 (connected to N), then two Cs (C-C), then N (with substituent Cc2...), then C-C-1. So the ring is a six-membered ring: positions are 1 (N connected to the amide group), then two carbons, then N (with substituent), then two carbons back to 1. So the ring atoms are N, C, C, N, C, C. So the ring is a piperazine-like ring. So the SMILES for the ring without substituents would be N1CCNCC1. Because the original ring is NC1CCN(...)CC1. Wait, the actual ring is C1CCN(...)CC1. So the ring starts at the first C (position 1), then two Cs, then N, then substituent, then two Cs, back to 1. Wait, that would make the ring C1-C-C-N(...)-C-C-1. So the ring is six-membered: C-C-N-C-C-C. Wait, no, because the N is part of the ring. So the actual structure is cyclohexane with two carbons between the two nitrogens. So the ring is C-C-N-C-C-N? No, that's five-membered. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write the ring structure. The ring is C1 connected to the next C, then another C, then N, then C (from Cc2...), then another C, and back to C1. Wait, no: the ring is C1 connected to C, C, N, then C (from CC1). Wait, the actual SMILES for the ring part is C1CCN(Cc2ccccc2)CC1. Breaking it down:\n\n- C1: start of the ring.\n- C: next atom.\n- C: third atom.\n- N: fourth atom, with a substituent (Cc2...).\n- (Cc2...): substituent on N.\n- CC1: fifth and sixth atoms (C and C) connecting back to C1.\n\nSo the ring is six-membered: positions 1 (C), 2 (C), 3 (C), 4 (N), 5 (C), 6 (C). Wait, that can't form a ring. Wait, no. The ring is C1 (position 1) connected to C (position 2), then C (position 3), then N (position 4), then C (position 5, from CC1). Wait, that would make the ring C1-C2-C3-N4-C5-C6 (C6 is position 1 again). Wait, that makes a six-membered ring with N at position 4. So the ring is C-C-C-N-C-C. So when removing substituents (the Cc2... group on N and the NC(=O)... group on C1), the scaffold would be the six-membered ring: C1-C2-C3-N4-C5-C6 (C6 connected back to C1). But in SMILES notation, how is that written? Let me try. The ring would start at N4, but in the original SMILES, the ring starts at C1. So after removing substituents, the ring is C1CCNCC1. Wait, but the original has two Cs after the first C1. So the ring is C1-C-C-N-CC1. Which would be C1 connected to C2, C3, N4, C5, C6 (C1 again). So the SMILES would be C1CCNCC1. Yes. Because in the original, after removing substituents, the ring is C1-C-C-N-CC1. So the scaffold is the piperidine ring (but wait, piperidine is six-membered with one N). Wait, but the ring here has two N atoms? No, in the original structure, the ring has one N. Wait, the original ring is C1CCN(...)CC1. So the ring is six-membered with one N. Wait, no, the N is part of the ring. Let me count: C1 (C), C2 (C), C3 (C), N4 (N), C5 (C), C6 (C). Then back to C1. So the ring is six-membered with one N. That's a piperidine ring. So the scaffold would be the piperidine ring, which in SMILES is C1CCNCC1. But wait, the original ring has two N atoms? No, only one N in the ring. Because the SMILES part is C1CCN(...)CC1. The N is in the fourth position. So the scaffold would be C1CCNCC1. So the Murcko scaffold is the piperidine ring. Therefore, the output should be {\"Output Scaffold\": \"C1CCNCC1\"}.",

Alright, first, I need to identify the rings and the connecting bonds.\n\nStarting with the structure, I see there's an ethyl group (CCO-), a carbonyl (C=O), and some oxygen-containing rings. The main part after removing side chains should be the ring systems. Let's break down the SMILES.\n\nLooking at the SMILES: there's a part C1CCCN1 which is a pyrrolidine ring (5-membered nitrogen ring). Then there's C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. This seems like a sugar-like structure. The OC2OC(C)(C)OC2 part forms a ring. Let me count the atoms here. The C2 is connected to O, then C which branches into (C)(C), another O, and back to C2. So that's a 5-membered ring: O-C-O-C(C)(C)-O? Wait, maybe a 6-membered ring? Let's map it out. The C1 is connected to O, then C2, which is part of OC2O... So maybe the ring is C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2? Hmm, perhaps a 4-membered ring? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the C1 is part of a tetrahydrofuran-like ring. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe part C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC: The C1 is connected to O, then C2. The C2 is connected to O, then C(C)(C), another O, then back to C2, making a ring. So C2 is part of a 5-membered ring: O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2? Wait, that would be a 5-membered ring with two oxygens. Then C1 is connected to O-C2 (which is part of that ring), and then back to C1 via OC. So C1's ring is O-C1-O-C2... No, maybe C1 is part of another ring. Let me try to draw this mentally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C1 is a 6-membered ring. C1 is connected to O, then C2 (which is part of a ring), then O, then back to C1. Wait, the SMILES is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. Breaking it down:\n\n- C1 is the first atom in ring closure 1.\n- O connects C1 to C2 (which is part of ring closure 2).\n- C2 is connected via O to C(C)(C), then another O, then back to C2 (forming a ring between C2, O, C(C)(C), O, and back to C2? That would make a 5-membered ring: C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2? But that's only 4 atoms (since C2 is counted once). Wait, no, SMILES notation for rings uses numbers to denote closures. So C2 is part of a ring closure here. Let me parse the sequence:\n\nC1 (start of ring 1) \u2192 O \u2192 C2 (start of ring 2) \u2192 O \u2192 C(C)(C) \u2192 O \u2192 C2 (closing ring 2) \u2192 C1 (closing ring 1) \u2192 O \u2192 C. Wait, maybe the ring closures are:\n\nRing 1: C1 connected via O-C2... then after the OC2 part, the C1 is closed again. So C1's ring would be C1-O-C2-O... (but where does it close?) Hmm, maybe the C1's ring is formed by C1-O-C2-O... and then when we get back to C1 at the end. Let me see:\n\nThe full part is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. So after the initial C1-O-C2-O..., then OC(C)(C), then O-C2 (closing ring 2), then C1 (closing ring 1), then O-C. So the rings are:\n\nRing 1: C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1? That seems like a 6-membered ring for C1? Wait, no. Let me try to write the sequence:\n\nStart with C1 connected to O, then to C2 (ring closure 2). Then C2 is connected to O, then C(C)(C), then O, then back to C2 (closing ring 2). Then back to C1 (closing ring 1), then O and another C. So the rings are:\n\nRing 2 (C2) is O-C(C)(C)-O connected to C2, making a 5-membered ring: C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2? Wait, that's a 4-membered ring? Because C2 is connected to O, then C(C)(C), then O, then back to C2. So the sequence is C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2, which is a 4-membered ring (C2, O, C, O). But that's not possible because you can't have a 4-membered ring with two oxygens unless it's a dioxolane or similar. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ring closure is C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2, which is a 5-membered ring if there's another atom. Wait, no. Let me count the atoms between the C2 closures. Starting at C2, then O, then C(C)(C), then O, then back to C2. That's four atoms: C2-O-C-O-C2. Wait, no. The SMILES is OC2OC(C)(C)OC2. So between the two C2s: O-C(C)(C)-O. So the ring would be C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2. That's four atoms: C2, O, C, O, C2. So it's a 5-membered ring? No, because from C2 to O (1), O to C (2), C to O (3), O to C2 (4). Wait, maybe it's a 4-membered ring? Because the atoms are C2, O, C, O, and then back to C2. But that's four bonds, forming a 4-membered ring, which is possible. Hmm, but that would be a dioxolane-like structure, which is a 5-membered ring. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let's think differently. The SMILES for a 5-membered ring with two oxygens would be something like C1OCOC1. But in this case, the SMILES is OC2OC(C)(C)OC2. So the C2 is connected to O, then to C(C)(C), then to O, then back to C2. So the ring is C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2. That's a 5-membered ring? Because C2 is connected via four bonds: O, C, O, and back. Wait, no, in SMILES, the ring closure numbers indicate the positions. So the C2 is the start and end. So the path is C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2. That's four atoms in between, making a 5-membered ring. Wait, no. The number of atoms in the ring is the number of bonds between the closure. So from C2 to O (1), O to C (2), C to O (3), O to C2 (4). So that's four bonds, forming a 5-membered ring? Because each bond connects two atoms. So C2 is atom 1, O is 2, C is 3, O is 4, and C2 is 5? Wait, no. The ring closure connects back to the starting atom, so the count is the number of atoms in the ring. For example, C1CCCC1 is cyclopentane (5-membered). So in this case, C2-O-C-O-C2 would be C2 (1), O (2), C (3), O (4), C2 (5). So a 5-membered ring. But in the given SMILES, it's C2 connected to O, then C(C)(C), then O, then back to C2. So that's C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2. So four atoms between the two C2s, making a 5-membered ring. So that's a 1,4-dioxane-like ring but with a substituted carbon. Wait, no, 1,4-dioxane is a 6-membered ring. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's move on and consider the main rings.\n\nThe main rings in the input are the pyrrolidine (C1CCCN1) and the other complex ring system. For Murcko scaffold, we need to retain all ring systems and the connecting bonds. The connecting bonds are the bonds that link two rings together. So, looking at the input structure, the molecule has two rings connected via a chain. Let's see: the main chain is CC(NC(=O)C1CCCN1)C1OC2... So the NC(=O) is attached to the central carbon, which is connected to the pyrrolidine ring (C1CCCN1). Then the central carbon is connected to another part which is the C1OC2... ring system. So the connecting bonds would be the bonds between the central carbon and the two rings. Wait, but Murcko scaffold removes all side chains except the rings and connecting bonds. So the scaffold would be the two rings (pyrrolidine and the other ring system) connected by the single bonds that were part of the original structure.\n\nBut wait, the original structure might have a central carbon connected to both rings. Let me visualize:\n\nThe SMILES is CCOC(=O)CC(NC(=O)C1CCCN1)C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The main chain starts with CCOC(=O)- (ethyl ester), then CC (a two-carbon chain), then the central carbon is connected to:\n\n   - NC(=O)C1CCCN1 (a carbamate group attached to a pyrrolidine ring)\n\n   - C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC (another ring system)\n\nSo the central part is the central carbon connected to the two rings via single bonds. So the Murcko scaffold would retain those two rings and the connecting bonds. But wait, the connecting bonds are the bonds that link the rings. If the rings are connected through a chain, then the scaffold includes the rings and the minimal chain connecting them. Wait, Murcko scaffold definition says to leave only the ring systems and connecting bonds. So any acyclic chains that connect two rings are reduced to single bonds. For example, if two rings are connected by a two-carbon chain, the scaffold would have those two rings connected by a single bond (the connecting bond). But I need to check the exact definition.\n\nWait, the definition says: \"the Murcko scaffold is obtained by removing all side chains, functional groups, and exocyclic modifications, leaving only the ring systems and connecting bonds.\"\n\nSo, any atoms that are part of a chain connecting two rings are retained, but side chains (like substituents on the rings) are removed. Exocyclic double bonds are converted to single bonds if they are part of a functional group. Wait, but in this case, the connecting chain between the two rings might be part of the scaffold.\n\nWait, the input structure has a central carbon connected to both rings. Let's see:\n\nThe central part is CC(NC(=O)...)C(...). So the central carbon is part of a chain. But since it's connected to two rings, perhaps the scaffold includes that central carbon as part of the connecting structure. Or maybe the central carbon is considered a connecting bond between the two rings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two rings are not directly connected but are part of different branches. In that case, the Murcko scaffold might only include the individual rings without any connection, but that's unlikely. Wait, the Murcko scaffold should include all rings connected through their original connecting bonds.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to draw the structure. Let's try:\n\nThe original molecule has an ethyl ester (CCOC(=O)), then a two-carbon chain (CC), then a central carbon connected to:\n\n- A nitrogen (NC(=O)C1CCCN1), which is a pyrrolidine ring with a carbonyl group.\n\n- Another carbon connected to a complex ring system (C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC).\n\nSo the central part is:\n\n...CC(C)(NC(=O)...)C(...)...\n\nWait, maybe the central carbon is connected to three groups: the previous carbon in the chain, the nitrogen group, and the ring system. If the central carbon is part of the connecting chain between the two rings, then the scaffold would include that carbon as a bridge. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the two rings are separate and not connected, so the Murcko scaffold would include both rings but not connected. But that contradicts the definition, which says to leave the connecting bonds. So perhaps there's a connecting bond between the two rings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central carbon is part of a chain that connects the two rings. Let me parse the SMILES again.\n\nThe SMILES is CCOC(=O)CC(NC(=O)C1CCCN1)C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC.\n\nBreaking it into parts:\n\n- CCOC(=O): ethyl ester\n\n- CC: two carbons (the ester is attached to the first C, then another C)\n\n- The next C is connected to:\n\n   - NC(=O)C1CCCN1 (pyrrolidine with a carbonyl)\n\n   - C1OC2... (the ring system)\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nethyl ester - CH2-CH(C)(NC(=O)pyrrolidine) - ring system.\n\nSo the central carbon (the third C in the chain) is connected to the pyrrolidine via an amide and to the ring system via an oxygen-containing ring.\n\nBut for the Murcko scaffold, we need to remove all side chains and functional groups. So the amide (NC(=O)) is a functional group and should be removed. Similarly, the ester (CCOC(=O)) is a side chain and removed. The oxygen-containing rings would be part of the scaffold if they are ring systems.\n\nSo the rings are:\n\n1. Pyrrolidine (C1CCCN1) but without the carbonyl (since that's a functional group). Wait, but the NC(=O) is attached to the pyrrolidine. Since the carbonyl is exocyclic, it would be removed, leaving the pyrrolidine ring.\n\n2. The other ring system: C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. But we need to remove any exocyclic groups. The OC at the end is a methoxy group? Or part of the ring.\n\nWait, let's parse that part again: C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC.\n\nThe C1 is part of a ring closure. The sequence is C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1-O-C.\n\nWait, after the C1, there's O, then C2, then O, then C(C)(C), then O, then C2 (closing ring 2), then C1 (closing ring 1), then O-C.\n\nSo the ring system here is a fusion of two rings? Or a bridged system?\n\nAlternatively, the C1 is part of a ring formed by C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to draw it step by step.\n\nStarting with C1:\n\nC1 connected to O, then C2 (start of ring 2).\n\nC2 connected to O, then C(C)(C), then O, then back to C2 (closing ring 2), forming a ring: C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2. That's a 5-membered ring (C2, O, C, O, C2? No, that's four atoms. Wait, C2 is the closure point. So the ring around C2 is O-C(C)(C)-O connected back to C2. That would be a 4-membered ring: C2-O-C-O-C2. But that's a 5-membered ring if including the C(C)(C). Wait, maybe it's a 5-membered ring with C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2. That's four bonds between the two C2s, making a 5-membered ring. Yes, because each bond connects two atoms. So C2 is atom 1, O is 2, C(C)(C) is 3, O is 4, and back to C2 (atom 5?), but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Regardless, the key is that there's a ring system here. The Murcko scaffold would retain this ring system.\n\nNow, the pyrrolidine ring (C1CCCN1) is connected via an amide group (NC(=O)), which is a functional group. So the NC(=O) is removed, leaving the pyrrolidine ring attached via a single bond to the central carbon. But since the central carbon is part of a chain that's not a ring, that chain would be considered a side chain and removed. Wait, but the central carbon is connecting two rings. If the central carbon is part of a chain that connects two rings, then the scaffold includes the rings and the connecting bonds. However, if the connecting chain has more than one atom, those atoms are considered part of the scaffold. Wait, according to the definition, the connecting bonds are retained. So any atoms that are part of the path connecting two rings are kept. So if two rings are connected by a chain of two carbons, those two carbons are part of the scaffold.\n\nBut in this case, the pyrrolidine is connected via NC(=O)- to a central carbon, which is connected to another ring. The NC(=O) is a functional group, so it's removed. So the pyrrolidine would be attached directly to the central carbon, which is also connected to the other ring. But the central carbon would then be part of the scaffold if it's part of the connecting structure between the two rings. However, if the central carbon is not part of a ring, then it's part of the connecting chain. But in this case, the central carbon is part of a chain that's between two rings. So the scaffold would include the two rings and the connecting atoms between them. But the original connecting chain might have been part of a larger structure, so we need to reduce it to the minimal connecting path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the central carbon is part of a bridge between the two rings. But I'm not sure. Let's think of another approach: process the SMILES through a Murcko scaffold algorithm. For example, using RDKit in Python, the Murcko scaffold is generated by removing side chains and keeping rings and linkers. But since I can't run code here, I have to mentally simulate it.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. Identify all rings in the molecule.\n\n2. Identify the linker atoms (those connecting the rings).\n\n3. Remove all atoms that are not part of rings or linkers.\n\nIn this case, the rings are the pyrrolidine and the other complex ring. The linker would be the atoms connecting them. Let's see:\n\nThe pyrrolidine is connected via NC(=O) to a central carbon, which is connected to the other ring. The NC(=O) is a functional group, so removed. So the pyrrolidine is attached to the central carbon via a single bond. The central carbon is also connected to the other ring. So the linker is just the central carbon. Therefore, the scaffold would be the pyrrolidine ring connected via a single bond to the central carbon, which is connected to the other ring. But the central carbon isn't part of any ring, so it's a linker atom. Therefore, the scaffold includes both rings and the central carbon connecting them.\n\nWait, but in the original structure, the central carbon is part of a chain (CC(C)(...)C(...)). After removing the side chains (the ethyl ester, the amide group), the remaining parts are the two rings connected by the central carbon. So the scaffold would be the two rings connected by that single carbon.\n\nBut the other ring system (C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC) has some substituents. Let's look at that ring system. The part OC(C)(C) is a substituent on the ring. So in the ring system, the OC(C)(C) would be a side chain and removed, leaving the ring itself. Wait, but OC(C)(C) is part of the ring? Or is it a substituent?\n\nIn the SMILES C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC, the C(C)(C) is connected to an oxygen that's part of the ring. Let's parse that part again. The C2 is part of a ring formed by O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2. So the C(C)(C) is a substituent attached to the ring. Therefore, in the Murcko scaffold, that substituent (the two methyl groups and the central carbon) would be removed, leaving the oxygen atoms and the ring carbons.\n\nWait, but if the C(C)(C) is part of the ring, then it's retained. If it's a substituent (exocyclic), it's removed. So in the ring system, the C(C)(C) is a bridge or part of the ring?\n\nLooking at the SMILES for the ring system: C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC.\n\nThe C1 is part of a ring closure. The sequence is C1-O-C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2-C1-O-C.\n\nWait, perhaps the C(C)(C) is part of the ring. For example, if the ring is C2-O-C(C)(C)-O-C2, then the C(C)(C) is part of the ring. But that would make a 5-membered ring with C2, O, C(C)(C), O, C2. So the ring is a 5-membered ring with two oxygens and a substituted carbon. So that part of the ring is retained in the scaffold. The C(C)(C) is part of the ring, so it stays. However, the exocyclic OC at the end (the last OC in C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC) is a substituent and should be removed.\n\nWait, the SMILES ends with C1OC. So after closing the C1 ring, there's an O-C. That O-C is a methoxy group attached to the C1 ring. So that's a side chain and should be removed.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- The pyrrolidine ring (C1CCCN1) is retained.\n\n- The other ring system: after removing the exocyclic methoxy (OC), the remaining part is the fused ring system consisting of the C1 and C2 rings. The C1 ring is connected to the C2 ring. The C2 ring has a C(C)(C) as part of the ring, so that's retained.\n\n- The linker between the two rings is the central carbon that was connected to both the pyrrolidine (via removed NC(=O)) and the other ring system.\n\nSo the scaffold would consist of the pyrrolidine connected via a single carbon (the central carbon) to the other ring system. But wait, the central carbon is connected to the other ring system via an oxygen? Let me check.\n\nThe other ring system's SMILES after removing substituents would be C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1. Wait, but the original part is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1OC. Removing the exocyclic OC (the last OC), the ring becomes C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1. So the C1 is part of a ring closure. The structure would be a fused ring system where C1 is connected to O, then C2 (part of the second ring), and so on. But without the exocyclic OC, the C1 ring is closed properly.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. However, the key point is that the Murcko scaffold retains all ring systems and connecting bonds. So the final scaffold should have the pyrrolidine ring and the other complex ring system connected via the minimal linker atoms.\n\nIn this case, the linker is the central carbon that was part of the original molecule's chain. Therefore, the scaffold is the pyrrolidine ring connected via a single carbon (the central one) to the other ring system, which includes the C(C)(C) as part of its ring.\n\nPutting this into SMILES, the pyrrolidine is C1CCCN1. The other ring system, after removing the exocyclic groups, would be C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1. Connecting these two via the central carbon (C) would result in a SMILES like C1CCCN1C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2.\n\nBut wait, how are they connected? The original connection was via the central carbon. So the scaffold would be the pyrrolidine (C1CCCN1) connected via a single carbon (C) to the other ring (C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2O). Wait, but the oxygen might still be part of the linker.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct SMILES is the two rings connected by a single bond. But in the original molecule, they are connected via a carbon that is part of a chain. So the linker is that carbon, making the scaffold have that carbon between the two rings.\n\nSo the SMILES would be C1CCCN1C.C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2O. But that doesn't make sense as they need to be connected. Alternatively, the correct SMILES would be C1CCCN1C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the two rings are not connected, but that's unlikely. The original molecule has the two rings connected via a central carbon. So the scaffold should include that carbon as part of the linker.\n\nTherefore, the final scaffold SMILES would be C1CCCN1CC2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2. But I need to check the connectivity.\n\nWait, the original structure's central carbon is connected to the pyrrolidine via a single bond (after removing the amide group) and to the other ring system via a single bond. So the scaffold would have the pyrrolidine (C1CCCN1) connected to a carbon (C) which is connected to the other ring system (C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2O). But the oxygen in the other ring might be part of the ring.\n\nAlternatively, the other ring system after removing the exocyclic groups is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1. So the SMILES for that ring is O1C2OC(C)(C)OC2C1.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. To simplify, the Murcko scaffold for the given SMILES should include the pyrrolidine ring and the other oxygen-containing ring system, connected via the central carbon. Therefore, the SMILES would be something like C1CCCN1CC2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact connectivity. Another approach is to look for known examples. For example, if a molecule has two rings connected by a single carbon, the Murcko scaffold would have those two rings connected by that carbon.\n\nIn this case, the input molecule has two rings connected via a central carbon. So the scaffold would be those two rings connected by that carbon. The rings are:\n\n1. Pyrrolidine: C1CCCN1.\n\n2. The other ring: after removing substituents, it's a fused or bridged ring system. Let's assume it's a bridged system. The SMILES for that ring after removing exocyclic groups is C1OC2OC(C)(C)OC2C1. But that includes the C(C)(C) as part of the ring.\n\nPutting it all together, the scaffold SMILES would be C1CCCN1CC2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2.\n\nBut to verify, perhaps the correct SMILES is C1CCCN1C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2. This connects the pyrrolidine's C1 to the C2 of the other ring via a single bond. However, in the original structure, the connection is through a central carbon, so the correct scaffold should include that central carbon as a linker.\n\nTherefore, the correct scaffold is C1CCCN1C(C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2). But SMILES notation requires proper closure. Alternatively, it's C1CCCN1C(C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2).\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way is to consider that the central carbon is part of the scaffold, linking the two rings. So the SMILES would be C1CCCN1C(C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2).\n\nHowever, considering that the original SMILES has the central carbon connected to both rings, the correct scaffold should have that carbon as a bridge. So the final answer would be the two rings connected via a single carbon, giving a SMILES like C1CCCN1CC2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the correct Murcko scaffold SMILES is C1CCCN1C2OC3OC(C)(C)OC3C2.",
