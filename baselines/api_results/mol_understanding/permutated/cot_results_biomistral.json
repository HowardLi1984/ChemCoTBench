In particular, Molecule B has less nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms compared to Molecule A.\",\n\"functional\\_group\\_comparison\": \"While Molecule A has a ketone functionality, Molecule B does not have a ketone functionality but instead has a nitrile functionality. Additionally, Molecule A has an ether functionality while Molecule B has an alkene functionality.\",\n\"output\": \"no\""
