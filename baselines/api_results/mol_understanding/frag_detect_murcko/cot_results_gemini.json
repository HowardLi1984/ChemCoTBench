The input SMILES is `O=C(O)Cc1ccc2c(c1)C(O)(C(F)(F)F)c1ccccc1-2`.\n2.  The core structure consists of three fused rings: two benzene rings (`c1ccc2...c(c1)` and `...c1ccccc1-2`) fused via a central carbon atom (`C`) to form a fluorene-like system.\n3.  The group `O=C(O)C-` (carboxymethyl) attached to the first benzene ring (`...Cc1...`) is an acyclic side chain and is removed entirely.\n4.  The central carbon atom `C` in `C(O)(C(F)(F)F)` is part of the fused ring system.\n5.  The substituents `(O)` (hydroxyl) and `(C(F)(F)F)` (trifluoromethyl) on this central carbon are exocyclic modifications/side chains and are removed.\n6.
